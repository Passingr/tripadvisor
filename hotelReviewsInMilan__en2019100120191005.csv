The free beverages in the minibar were a nice touch and appreciated. I took full advantage of the yummy breakfast and enjoyed an aperitif each evening in the bar which also included some light antipasti. While not my favorite location in Milan, it is very conveniently located a short walking distance from the central station. Otherwise, the neighborhood is full of tourists and lackluster restaurants.

7,A few nights stay at the end of a 3 week holiday. Great location within a few minutes walk of the Central Train Station and Metro Lines. Close to great bars and restaurants. The Hotel decor in the common areas is very dated. But the room was modern and tidy. For €20 extra can extend late check out to 2pm - quite handy.

The hotel is only a few steps away from the central station (Train, Tram and Metro....perfect for a sightseeing trip) The welcoming at the hotel was already very warm and friendly. The service of the staff is unbeatable. The receptionist gave us a lot of useful tips to make our trip as unique and worthwhile as possible. The hotel is already a bit older but very cosy. The room was clean and the beds very comfortable. The bathroom is quite small but also clean and functional. The continental breakfast offered a wide range of fresh food for every taste.

The staff here are also very helpful and friendly, we felt really welcome here! Room was really spacious, big bathroom with a spa bath, great toiletries, free minibar. Not the most modern but absolutely had everything we needed. Breakfast was okay. You have to leave your key at reception when you leave the hotel which I thought was quite odd. Otherwise, we were really happy with our stay and would definitely recommend.","June 21, 2019","0    Hotel Berna

14,"Recommended by Rick Steve’s, stay was fine but if all the hotels we stayed at in Italy this was too expensive for the room we had. Side note- Outlet in bathroom does not work. Being in the annex is like the stepchild across the street. Keycard didn’t work but bellman took care of although had to wait. Just not worth the price we paid and my cousin had the same room for over 100 euro less. ","June 15, 2019","0    Hotel Berna

15,"Our first visit to Milan -and we were delighted with our decision to stay at the Hotel Berna. Firstly the location is ideal--just a few minutes walk from the Central station where we arrived on the regular shuttle bus from Linate airport. 5 minutes walk and we were at the hotel. It is also 2 minutes from the yellow and the green metro lines-which take you to the city centre , or to other attractions like the wonderful Navigli district. The metro is easy to use -so being near one means you can get anywhere in the city very easily. Reception staff were courteous and efficient, as were all the staff throughout the hotel . Our room was number 226 and it was a good size with a large comfortable bed , free soft drinks replenished every day, and a decent bathroom . It was also spotlessly clean. Breakfast was as described in previous reviews--a great choice , and plenty of it-even including a machine to juice carrots !The restaurant manager is extremely friendly . The bar is also well worth a visit, with plenty of choice -and a charming bar manager. Milan is a wonderful city to visit -worthy of a week in itself. we were here 4 nights and also took in a day trip to beautiful Bellagio -via Varenna which is only an hour by train from the Central Station -another great advantage of staying in this hotel. We really want to return to Milan -and will definitely stay at the Berna next time .","June 11, 2019","0    Hotel Berna

Great service and clean rooms, even with little surprises for the visitor to bring home... The breakfast selection is very good, lots of fresh fruit, yoghurt and granola, breads and spreads, vegetables, eggs and different cold/hot drinks. I also tried the room service, which was very good. They recommended a very nice restaurant, that we ended up going back to both days (Osteria Fara). Great experience at hotel Berna, I give them all my best:)","June 6, 2019","0    Hotel Berna

31,"The breakfast were just amazing - there was a lot of to choose from and also the quality was rather good.The location of the hotel is excellent - just few steps away from the Centrale and subway station there. Also the neighbourhood is fine; few very good places very close-by to go eat.However by the room was not impressed that much. While booking (using the hotel reservation system) based on the pics i got an impression we could get a room in the tower. Unfortunately was not the case. Our room had something like ‘cushion-like’ walls which looks anti-modern nowadays; inventory definitely needs some refurbishments; although there was a temperature screen inside i very doubt it was working. And it was very dull. Staying there for a few hours i guarantee you fall into a depression soon. Also would be preferable to upgrade to using queen/king size mattresses and consider card-based key system and abandon ancient system with annoying system of leaving and picking the key at the front desk.Also half of the front desk personnel was rather hard to deal with. (The issue with some rooms left unlocked by the room service one day i want to believe was just an individual misconduct, not the whole place fail).Bottomline - yes, for all the good things (listed above) i’d probably consider staying again, would just definitely ensure what room getting before confirming a reservation.","May 19, 2019","0    Hotel Berna

34,"This hotel was conveniently located – about three minutes walking distance from the central station. The neighborhood was full of restaurants and very safe.I stayed for only one night in a single room. The size of the room was fine for one person. It had a single bed, mini bar, safe, electric kettle, desk, chair, tv. There was no wardrobe, just a rack with hangers. It did not have airconditioning, just an electric fan, but this was not a problem for me as I was there in early April and temperatures were low. But I am sure this is going to be a problem for guests staying during the summer months. The room, overall, was pretty basic but looked dour and in need of refurbishment. I particularly did not dig the drapes that were supplied to cover the area where the safe and the hanging rack were placed. Ditto the floor carpet that seemed overdue for replacement. Wifi was fast. Electric outlets were limited and not conveniently placed. The bathroom had a great shower, spotless and of good size. Towels were pristine white and toiletries were provided. Buffet breakfast was pretty basic with limited choices.Would I stay here again? If location is the only factor to consider, I would. But in terms of quality of room, not.","May 11, 2019","0    Hotel Berna

In the lobby you can find tea and snacks, and you can also make tea in your room. Drinks in the mini-bar (in my room it was water and a soft drink) are free.

The breakfast buffet was extensive, more than traditional continental/Italian menu, including proteins.There are several restaurants in walking distance and a few late-night places across the street, and they get noisy late at night.

44,"The only thing that prevented me from giving Hotel Berna 4-Stars is the temperature of the room...it was obnoxiously hot. Another Euro Hot Box! I don’t know what it is with these European hotels that program the air conditioner based on the outside temperature and not the inside. My room was boiling! And I had great difficulty sleeping. Opening the window helped a tiny bit, but was impossible at night due to street noise. In the morning, by the time I showered, had a cup of coffee, and got ready for the day, I was sweating bullets. Several times I propped open my room door because the hallway was at least 10 degrees cooler. I talked to a lot of other guests and they said the same thing. In reality, Hotel Berna lied when saying “Air Conditioning”. It should be “Air Conditioning in the summer only.”Other than that, everything was very nice. The room was clean, nice, modern, and comfy. The bed was small, but hey…it was just me. The staff was friendly and courteous, and the location was fantastic. I would never stay there again because it was just too darn hot for me.

There are plenty of restaurants nearby for you to try. The hotel itself isn't modern which we were aware of. The atmosphere in the hotel is quite cozy. The room was small but we had no problem with that since we spent most of our time exploring Milan anyway. The staff were friendly, nothing to complain about. I'm also happy with the room cleaning. Also, you get free water bottles everyday! Now onto the breakfast, which many of the reviewers were happy about. I was having high expectations but unfortunately it was a letdown. Breakfast was mediocre compared to other hotels I've been to. The food was cold and cakes were dry. Coffee was good though, but other than that nothing too special. All in all, I would recommend this hotel nonetheless! ","April 23, 2019","0    Hotel Berna

46,"The location is literally around the corner from the central train station in Milan which was very convenient for our travel plans. The staff were very attentive and responsive to our requests for information. We arrived early in the day well before check-in but were still made to feel welcome. We were invited to sit in the lounge for coffee or tea and to refresh before we headed out for the day. We were able to store our luggage and obtain day passes for transportation to spend our day sight-seeing in Milan before returning late afternoon to check in. The room was clean and comfortable. We stayed in the tower rooms across the street from the hotel, but access was easy and controlled and with elevator access. The hot breakfast buffet provided lots of variety and quality and the service was great. We were made to feel welcome and taken care of from arrival to departure.","April 20, 2019","0    Hotel Berna

49,I flew into Milan from Houston and booked 1 night in Milan. I arrived early in the morning so was planning on dropping my luggage then doing some sightseeing around the Milan Cathedral the day I arrive then get a good nights sleep hitting the ground running the next morning with a couple scheduled tours before heading to the train station. The hotel was in a good location being a short walk with good sidewalks from the train station. The hotel staff is very helpful in offering advice on getting around and even set up a reservation at a local restaurant. My only complaint was the room was stuffy and I could not cool the room without opening the window. I like to sleep in a cold room so I did not get a good nights sleep.,"April 12, 2019","0    Hotel Berna

51,"If I could give this amazing hotel the full 7-star rating, I would do so without a second thought! I had booked my room through Expedia (as I always have) and right after the confirmation, I received regular emails directly from the hotel welcoming me. In addition, they also sent me some questions as to how I wanted my room to be ""served"" before my arrival (type of blanket/pillow, room temperature, what kind of drinks I wanted to be included in the FREE mini-bar on my first day). Wow!! I have never had any 5-star hotels asking me these questions before!! I arrived (too) early for check-in, but were greeted warmly (despite the very long queue from others who had also arrived early). The concierge efficiently stored my luggage securely (by giving me luggage tags), so that I could start my day-trip to Bergamo without much fuss.Location-wise, this hotel is ideal, not only for those who want to be located near the Centrale Stationze, but also for those who want to explore the highlights of the city. I had stayed at another hotel near Duomo for my first 3 days in the city, but I wouldn't mind staying at Berna in the future, because the rate is much cheaper, with high quality and standard in terms of both its rooms and service.My room is a ""Quality Single"" - spacious enough for my big luggage and hand luggage, with sufficient storage cupboard. My single bed was very comfortable, the writing table with thoughtfully located socket for my laptop was brightly lighted for work. Mini-fridge with 2 bottles of mineral water (still & gas) plus another 2 cans of soft drinks (of my choice made before arrival) were free for the first day. Coffee/tea making facility was also provided for. Shower was powerful and hot, wifi was free and strong from the room. Room was very clean, basic toiletries and towels were of good quality. A cute plastic duck as a free gift in the sink was a really nice touch and brought the ""intended smile"" to my face!! Breakfast was of a wide spread of choices and included in the room rate (can't believe how reasonable the rate was for a city like Milan!!). Waiters were friendly despite having to serve so many guests. Front-desk staff were also excellent, and so was the guy who stored my luggage.Overall, you can see very thoughtful and personal touches to details in the room and the entire management of the hotel. Congratulations to the Owners and managers!! I LOVED my stay here, and can't wait to return again in my next trip to MIlan!!","April 10, 2019","0    Hotel Berna

52,"Our introduction to the charm and ambiance of passion of the historic city of Milan: were the patrons at the hotel Berna. Exhausted and confused after a very long flight from the USA to Italy, their professionalism and hotel savvy stepped up and created a trusting and quality environment for someone so far from home. True professionals in the world of the service industry, and hotel etiquette. Once we passed through the front door we were no longer strangers however: honored guests. Every moment during our lengthy stay, was greeted with respect and travelers coddle. Never a worry once we signed in as a guest.Helpful and sincere beyond explanation, it truly was amazing-a dream come true for our entire stay.The hotel was highly recommended to me by my own medical Doctor, he was completely correct in all of his information and claims.This hotel and its staff, are the most professional that I have seen in a very long time. I kept pinching myself the entire time of our stay, is this real!As with the enormity of their professional hospitality their cleanliness surpassed anything I have ever witnessed before.Under the beds, over the beds, in the closets the entire room was royally cleanliness at its best. The relationship between staff and patron: phenomenal. Their caring concern topped off with their knowledge made a huge different in our stay in their incredible international city. Breakfast as well as Aperitivo another service presentation they have perfected and achieved. To experience such an incredible hotel in a foreign country was truly a treasured gift. Hotel is a very short distance for the mail train station in Milan, another plus to our stay.I can’t say it enough, this hotel towers above the rest for quality.","April 9, 2019","0    Hotel Berna

We did walk around Milan (5 hours of walking) which was enjoyable (lovely castle and gardens).Nice, modern hotel, very clean. Professional, welcome reception. Our room had a huge bed with a couple of cups worth of complimentary coffee. Breakfast was typical of the type, very satisfactory (we didn't eat dinner there).The hotel has nice facilities. A gym (smallish, with Technogym equipment) which doesn't appear to get used much! Plus a pool, jacuzzi, steam room and sauna. Unless you have a slightly upgraded room (which we did), you have to pay extra to use everything (not sure how much). You have to wear an unattractive swim cap which you can buy for 1 Euro.

68,"The first sign that this would be a luxurious experience was the breathtaking building entrance, especially after dark. The lobby is spacious and gleaming. The doorman greeted us before we entered the property and was at the ready to help us the entire visit. The desk clerks were a bit less friendly but professional nonetheless – more no-nonsense businesslike. Entering the room was a true “wow” moment, of which I have very few even in my 80+ nights a year travels. From the furnishings to the plush robes and towels to the top of the line amenities, there was little to be desired. Befitting an Italian luxury hotel, there was marble and thick carpeting everywhere. We didn’t ask for the royal suite but it felt as if we had. One of my pet peeves is water pressure, which can be lacking even in the nicest hotels. I can honestly say the shower here was the most powerful I’ve ever experienced in a hotel. I’ve only felt such heat and pressure in the thermal spa on cruise ships. Unlike the previous three hotels on our Italy trip, many of the lights were controlled with a digital panel – not the confusing buttons which seem to be the standard in hotels here. There was little to complain about. Don’t expect a fancy coffeemaker. It’s just a hot pot, the exact same one we had just had at a $69 hotel , with the same Nescafe instant coffee. We didn’t have time to use the pool but were surprised that there is a substantial charge to do so, as there was for the parking. When booking, there was no indication of a fee unless I literally hovered over the word “parking” with my mouse pointer on the site I used to book the stay (as I discovered after I returned home). Still, the location understandably warranted it and the charge was reasonable. Later that evening, as we headed out towards the subway, the doorman stopped us, grabbed a map, and eagerly directed us to exactly where we needed to go – without our asking. That is great service. It’s one reason – of many – that my one night there was much too short and I would love to return to Milan for a longer stay.","March 30, 2019","1    Grand Visconti Palace

The reception service was very good, we were introduced to the concierge who recommended the hotel restaurant and another one close by, he was very keen to help make our stay a good one and made us feel very welcome. I was quite disappointed that the swimming pool was not included in our room rate and was €20. I expected all of the spa facilities to be optional extras but not the swimming pool. The area was not vibrant, but we found some decent eateries and bars within about a 10-15 minute walk. We brought two drinks in the hotel bar which cost €17 which we felt was too expensive. The prices of the mini bar in our room were ridiculous. €4.50 for a tiny bar of chocolate no bigger than a tea bag or for a tiny tube of nuts. This said, we could not fault the service, and the rooms were to a very high standard which is why I have given 4/5 as my trip advisor review. ","March 17, 2019","1    Grand Visconti Palace

Rather he was concerned about check in and I had to wait at the reception for almost 29 minutes to complete the check in as he wanted to even print the receipt at the same time. No sense of arrival time and what he should do when someone reaches late night and is tired. Breakfast is ok with decent selection of breakfast dishes.

First they state they provide ""no prepayment needed - pay at the property"" option for a higher room price on booking.com. As soon as I booked this option they tried to preauthorise money form my card, stating that this is a hotel policy. If you pay more money for a room to get this option (btw also with free cancelation) I would not expect someone to preauthorise money. This is the whole logic to pay higher price for the room. Secondly I really didn't like the tone of the support person replying to my emails and I believe this is a good indication and red flag that most of they staff might have pretty much the same attitude towards their customers.

81,"Front desk staff very helpful in assisting us getting train tickets for our next stop. They also offered dining suggestions and made reservations for us. Rooms quiet and comfortable. One of the best breakfast buffets on our 2-week trip in Italy (5 hotels). Enjoyed the pool area, which opens at 3pm. Close to Metro, and one of the best recommendations was for us to purchase a 24-hour ticket (just over 4 euros). Good location!","November 5, 2018","1    Grand Visconti Palace

82,"I’ll start with the good : 1. a girl named Faith at the restaurant was a delight. The food at the restaurant was great. 2. The two girls for the evening shift at the reception were easy and warm, also booked a taxi for us to the airport. 3. Tamer - A man helping with luggages was really warm. Also, a man at the bar was nice who came to the room to open the wine. Now the bad : 1. Most of their staff wasn’t warm at all. I don’t know if it was Milan in general where people are like that towards Asians because overall I’ve found people in Milan being very cold towards Asians and not any other place in Italy. The receptionist didn’t even show us the breakfast place or time until we asked. 2. Not at all a 4 star especially after travelling all over Italy and otherwise. The basics- There was an extra 8 euro charge for room service. The bathrooms didn’t have lotions or dental kits unless asked for. One night,The bed had a bug which I informed the reception about which they said they will take care of. The towel had a stain. The entire hotel bar had only one wine opener and couldn’t give it to us in our room so the bartender did oblige and open it for us which was sweet. The staff at breakfast wouldn’t get you anything even if you asked which I understand since it’s self service but they would just point towards the buffet and ask you to get it on your own, even if it was water. Today, I had to take breakfast for my mother in the room because of her knee problem, the staff told me that wasn’t allowed and that wasn’t ok to take until I specified my problem. They switched off the entire AC control of the hotel as it was close to a 16 degree in Milan and there was no way to switch it on since it was centrally controlled. We found that absurd because we’ve paid for an AC room and had 4 nights there out of which 2 didn’t have the AC. We told the reception about that but she suggested getting a fan instead. The AC should be a personal choice! This place doesn’t serve you well like a 4star should and needs to definitely work on their hospitality. The place is also a good 20 minutes away from the Milan centre. There were definitely more misses than hits. Totally missable! ","October 24, 2018","1    Grand Visconti Palace

As a result, we were limited with local restaurants and needed to travel further afield to have dinner out.However, It’s a perfect location for visiting the city and lakes (we did both) and the transport links are very easy. The hotel staff were delightful and the breakfast buffet was plentiful and fresh.The pool was closed when we were there for refurbishment which we knew before we arrived and this will absolutely enhance any trip as the facilities looked great.

87,"I stayed for two night from 1 Oct-3 Oct on a business no problems as it should be. Staff seemed friendly not that I had to call them or ask anything. Breakfast was ok but the scrambled egg was really runny and didn’t look too appealing. I went away for one night to Vicenza and came back on 4th Oct. After checking in while I was trying to do some work all the lights in the room started to go on and off repeatedly at about 10-30 mins interval. I called reception and they promptly sent me a maintenance person within 5 mins to have a look. While this person is in my room obviously the light didn’t go off and with limited English he explained that the key cards might not have been inserted properly (it was). Anyways soon after this person leaves the light started to go on and off again so I called the reception again this time I wait for 30 mins no one comes and I had to meet a colleague for dinner so I told reception that I am going out. The person at the desk says they will replace my faulty key card when I return. I come back around 11:30pm the receptionist gave me two key cards and tells me that I shouldn’t have problem but if I do they will put room’s light setting to manual so it stays on permanently regardless of key card present. I went to my room and while I was trying to catch up on email and this poltergeist thing starts again this time the difference was there were no natural light outside. I called reception again and this time a completely different person answers and after explaining and asking about this “magic” manual setting she said she will do that. Finally thinking it’s all sorted I was in the shower when the light goes out completely (trust me not fun experience) potentially very dangerous. I call again and now she tells me that all the room were fully booked so she could not change my room and only thing she could do was help me find another hotel in the middle of the night past mid night. I politely declined the ridiculous offer and decide to go to bed without finishing my work and hoped that with natural morning sunlight I could finally finish my work. Next morning came I didn’t sleep well due to this constant humming noise coming from possibly some kind of machinery near by, I wake up to find my phone and my laptop I left charging wasn’t charged at all. Now up until this point this point all the power outlet was working.As I was checking out I complained to the receptionist that I was not happy at all about the service and the stay but she seemed more concerned about what I had from mini bar and ensuring I pay every single cents for the water I drank from the mini bar. After I paid for the room and mini bar tab and while I was talking to her to complain she continue to answer the phone in mid conversation and afterward just said I will pass the message the general manager later. As I was traveling with colleagues who were waiting for me so I left also I hate making a scene. I didn’t feel valued as customer at all. No offer of gestures of goodwill or sincere apology for completely unacceptable stay in the hotel. ","October 5, 2018","1    Grand Visconti Palace

My sons and I stayed four four nights, and for four nights we played ‘musical beds’ - neither of us could get comfortable; the beds were hard and lumpy. We opted not to have the expensive buffet breakfast each day; we went across the street to the cafe and had coffee and something to eat for a fraction of the cost - and the food was delicious and the owner, very friendly. The turn-down service at night, was a nice touch!The pool closure was a huge disappointment, and really spoiled our stay a bit; we had both looked forward to cooling off in the Pool after busy days sightseeing.

103,"We stayed at the Grand Visconti Palace on our recent family trip to Europe. Milan was our first overnight stop and planned to go to Lake Como for the day, then head to Venice, Salzburg, Rothenburg ob de Tauber, St. Moritz, and then back to Milan to fly home. We selected this hotel because it had spacious accommodations for a family of 4. The hotel was located near public transportation so that worked well and there were decent restaurants within walking distance. The hotel itself was very lovely and with well appointed rooms; however, the hotel staff were very unfriendly and unwelcoming upon our arrival. We had traveled over 10 hours, had very little sleep or food, and were met with having to fill out extensive paperwork - me, my husband, my 19 year old daughter, and my 17 year old son. Our cousins - another family of 4 - were also staying here as we traveled together and they were not asked to all fill out this paperwork. They could not give me a straight answer of why other than my daughter ""was over 18."" Well, my son was not and he had to do it as well. My cousin's son was 21 and he was not asked to fill out any paperwork. No other hotel on our 4 country trip asked us to do this. A welcome drink or something would have been nice upon arrival. We promptly stowed our luggage away in the room - which was really nice - and hopped back on a train and headed to Lake Como. So glad we made the time to see it since we were only in Milan overnight. The breakfast the next morning out in the garden area was the best part as all 8 of us grabbed a table. The food was plentiful and there were lots of options but the service was horrendous. They simply did not want to serve us and when we tried to serve ourselves a simple cup of coffee they seemed annoyed that we were walking outside to our table with a cup of coffee. Well...perhaps someone should have brought us some coffee when we asked for it 30 minutes earlier! Not sure I would stay at this hotel again based upon poor service. Rooms and breakfast are nice - hopefully if you stay here you will get better service!","July 24, 2018","1    Grand Visconti Palace

105,"With such good reviews, i had high expectations for this place on the final leg of a recent family trip to Italy and Greece.It was disappointing. It is mainly full of business travellers so if you want a big business hotel, this is for you. If you want a hotel that is friendly and welcoming, avoid this one.On the plus side:- very nice big rooms that were spacious for a family of four. These were excellent- good convenient to transport though not much in the area of any interestOn the down side:- staff were not friendly at all. on checkout, i was asked to settle the bill, even though i had a confirmation email from them telling me they had already charged my credit card. A 15 min debate ensued, which we had to go back and check our statements online (using their poor free wifi!). Staff were non apologetic at their error in emailing me confirmation of payment (which they had never taken) then asking for payment again- breakfast was extensive but very very poor quality. Our worst breakfast in 4 week of Italy and Greece travel- free wifi in rooms is poor. If you want better you need to pay for it. Not good enough these days- garden area is infested with mosquitos. We had breakfast in the garden area one day and regretted it for the rest of our stay- pool / spa was closed for maintenance. this is a major drawcard to the hotel. no apology or compensation for this.In general, great rooms but poor service and unfriendly staff make this place one to avoid for families in my view.Disappointing.","July 22, 2018","1    Grand Visconti Palace

When you get to the station get a song or journey ticket valid for 90 mins and costs 1.50 euro. Take he orange Line to Duomo and then once there change to the red line and get off at Porto Venezia. Take exit of Buenos Aires and it’s pretty much there. When going back to the airport to the the reverse. Hotel is central located and is within walking distance to pretty much everywhere. We walked 30 mins to Castello Sforzesa, approx 15 walk to Duomo and if you fancy going to the canals where there are lots of bars and restaurants it’s about 40 mins. There is a park close by which is has a pretty equipped children’s playground if you have kids or want to sit in the sun.Staff: brilliant friendly staff, check in was with Alissa (I think it was) was extremely professional and friendly and we were able to check in upon arrival which we didn’t expect we could. Breakfast was good and worth the money, typical croissants, cheese, ham, tomatoes, selection of cereals, yoghurts, juices. Hot food was only sausages bacon and scrambled eggs. Staff in the breakfast room were very welcoming and attentative top marks to Domenico and AnnaLisa- all restaurants should have these two welcoming and serving people to this standard. Rooms: we booked a classic standard room and were given a room with street view which was just brilliant- although could do with double glazing at night as very loud sirens. Bath room was small - any bigger persons might find it difficult to take a shower in the small cubicle- could do with a revamp and new tiles but otherwise sufficient. Toiletries are provided and include, shampoo, shower gel and body lotion. You also get a small amenities kit including shower cap, ear plus, ear buds, cotton wool and shoe shine. Hairdryer in room but no ironing facilities but you can request these. The room comes equipped with a mini bar, kettle and teas and coffees. Our cleaner Sharesh did a great job always super clean and lovely to return back to a nice fresh room. Would highly recommend hotel because of the fantastic staff, location and rooms were a good size and most importantly clean. I would definitely return here if I come back to Milan.

The staff was fabulous as was the free breakfast buffet. The rooms we spacious with high ceilings and tall windows that could actually be swung wide so you could step out and watch the activity on the street. It is centrally located in a busy neighborhood about a twenty minute walk to the Doumo which is the actual center of Milano.,"April 6, 2019","2    WORLDHOTEL Cristoforo Colombo

116,"The trip to Milan was a birthday present from my husband and me to our 18-year-old son Antoni, a keen opera lover. Of course, Teatro alla Scala was part of the package. :) I booked the hotel because it looked great on photos, and most importantly, had enthusiastic reviews.Antoni was absolutely impressed with the hotel and the level of service. The first photo we got from Milan was an artistic fruit salad he received with compliments in his hotel room, which miraculously appeared a class higher than what we actually booked. Antoni shared with us someone had brought him a bottle of champagne, but he politely refused alcohol – hence the fruit salad. :)The staff was super nice, starting from birthday wishes on arrival and a thorough explanation on where to go in Milan including a city map, ending with a kind staff member helping Antoni tidy his suit when he was leaving for the opera. The fabulous “La Traviata” with Placido Domingo and the exceptional hotel experience made it all a fantastic trip.If we have an opportunity, we will definitely book the hotel again.","March 16, 2019","2    WORLDHOTEL Cristoforo Colombo

It started with great first impression, the staff welcomed us like at home and that continued till our check-out. We received nice gifts every day, the reactions of staff members were more than accurate and instant - they even kept in mind our preferences for breakfast (great meals!). In addition, the minibar was always replenished in no time. One of the best experiences, we will definitely come back. Highly recommended.","February 4, 2019","2    WORLDHOTEL Cristoforo Colombo

119,"We visited here for my partners 30th birthday in December and were very pleased with the location. Heaps of restaurants, bars and shops on your doorstep and the staff were very friendly.The room was very nice and a good size as was the bathroom. The breakfast was a slight let down, lovely staff there and very efficient but the cooked food was cold and there was not a lot of choice.As it was my partners birthday they upgraded our room and they sent champagne which was really appreciated.One thing to mention was the spa, I picked this hotel because it had a lovely looking spa and I paid for the room with spa access however upon check in we were told the spa was closed for the next 2 days which was extremely disappointing as we had planned to use the spa every morning and this had been the reason I picked this hotel. We were assured the spa would work on our last day (my partners birthday) and on this day we sat in there for 1.5 hours without it working before being told it was still not working which was so upsetting especially as I had tried to plan it all for my partners birthday. In the end once I made a fuss we were given a free massage each but the spa was a let down and if someone was picking this hotel for the spa I would maybe have a second thought.","January 7, 2019","2    WORLDHOTEL Cristoforo Colombo

Further to this massive problem, the hotel is nice but staff seem to think that they are paying you instead of you paying them.In regards to the theft of my family’s money, staff has been extremely unhelpful and quite rude.

124,"The best thing about this hotel is its central location. A 2 minute walk to the subway station. A 2 minute walk in the other direction to great shopping. A good 15 minute walk has you in the city’s hotspot, the Duomo Square — with all of the high end shops. Yet it is far enough away that you don’t have the noise of the massive Duomo crowds around the hotel. Check-in was very simple and they hand you a rose as you come in (vase is provided in your room,). The hotel restaurant food was excellent for breakfasts and dinner - and if you can’t stay for breakfast due to a tour, they will pack you a ‘take-away’. The room size for a single is typical of most European hotel rooms — quite small. Stayed a few days later in a couples’ room and it was much larger. My only complaint about this hotel would be that in the single room, you can hear a lot of noise in your neighbor’s room — the sound of plugs being put into the wall or water running in the bathroom. But otherwise a very good hotel with very good service!","November 1, 2018","2    WORLDHOTEL Cristoforo Colombo

131,"We stayed here twice on our recent European road tour and thought it was excellent. Had a bit of a time of it finding it as the satnav was a bit confused with the oneway, but once there the valet parking took care of the car, our bags were dealt with, I was given a rose, we were both given chilled water (we needed it) and we were taken up to our upgraded room, no 603, as smart and stylish as you would expect from Milan. The bathroom in particular was superb with lots of space and the best shower ever, I wanted to take it home! Complimentary minibar which was a nice gesture. The first time we stayed for two nights, ate in the restaurant as we were tired after a long drive from Beaune on the first night. There is a taxi rank outside the hotel so very easy to get into the centre which isn't far away, and it is close to one of the stops of the sightseeing blue bus route which was also useful. We spent the next day sightseeing and ate out that evening at Lucca nearby (very good). There was a very pleasant bar area for a drink, and an excellent buffet breakfast selection in the morning. The staff were brilliant. The second time was for one night on our return journey, when we were attending the ballet at La Scala so we didn't spend much time in the hotel but as we knew where everything was (including how to find it!) it made it a very stress free experience. We were even staying in the same room! I would definitely recommend it for anyone looking for an almost city centre hotel which has a parking facility.","September 19, 2018","2    WORLDHOTEL Cristoforo Colombo

It was superb, of exceptional note were the shower and bed.This is in a par with a very high end four star in the best categories. Breakfasts were generous with plenty of choice to suite any taste.Compared to some hotels that claim to be four star but are little better than three, this is far above expectations. Indeed some hotels would class themselves as five star at this level.Overall, a surprisingly wonderful experience that left me deeply impressed. That’s not easy to do.

145,"Me and my girlfriend stayed here for two nights whilst in Milan and our high hopes for the place have been unfortunately dashed. After reading TA reviews, we expected a 4 star hotel and on arrival, we got it! The hotel is beautifully presented, with helpful staff to help you with anything from restaurant recommendations to booking a taxi, both of which we did whilst staying. However, this is where the good part of the review stops. When we made it to our room on the 3rd floor, we entered a room with an unusual smell, something my girlfriend picked up on first before I did shortly after. We opened the window and went about our business in Milan hoping the smell would go by the time we had returned. It unfortunately hadn’t and we sprayed some perfume to kill the smell as best as we could. It gets better... Milan has been reaching temperatures of 30c this week and the advertised air con was considering by us to be a blessing. However, it didn’t work. We suffered this until midnight when we couldn’t take it any longer and called out maintenance, who to their credit, came quickly. After realising the vent to the air con was closed, we thought it would be okay. It wasn’t, the air con had as much puff as an asthmatic blowing up balloons and my asthmatic girlfriend would know! Finally, we found the limited breakfast choices to be abysmal and what we expected on first impressions of a 4 star striving to be a 5 star, has unfortunately ended in a 2 star rating instead. It’s such a shame considering we had high hopes too","June 12, 2018","2    WORLDHOTEL Cristoforo Colombo

We had a double room on the 3rd floor, which was fairly small but no issues with that as we weren't planning to spend a lot of time in the room. The room was clean, comfortable and had everything we needed, facing the road with great views of the city.As some reviews have said the road can be quite noisy, despite soundproofing and there is noise from adjoining rooms and from the metro but nothing that is worth complaining about.Breakfast was good, service was good, staff were very polite and helpful. There is a metro station right outside the hotel which is great for getting around the city.One plus was after arriving back to the hotel after a long hot day there was a bottle of chilling champagne and fruit waiting for us in the room, which was swiftly finished off. I did mention it was our anniversary so may have been for that or our very late check in, whichever it was very much appreciated.Would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Milan, which is a great place to see.","June 11, 2018","2    WORLDHOTEL Cristoforo Colombo

It's very well connected (trams, metro and trains) as well as at a walkable distance to the station (Milano Centrale).I didn't rate it as excellent as I was in an aisle of the hotel where smoking was allowed; hating the smell of cigarette, it was a very negative point for me to smell it in the corridor while leaving my room (even though it was not super strong).

Thank you also for the late check out to all the marathons runners, it was highly appreciated :) well done PRO: close to the metro, P.ta Venezia and Corso Buenos Aires are great shopping area.****Breakfast was also very disappoint.. lovely the touch with fresch orange juice .. but otherwise, i have seriuosly seen better considering the 4 **** of the hotel. it´s basic nothing to complain but again ... it was very blend, and basic... fresch homemade cakes ( and not buy ) or delicius briosches italian style could be served, instead of the small frozen one ... Overall, I will not suggest this hotel to my friends, I am sorry, but the stunt that was made for the room was a huge mistake and truly disappointment .. you might not care, as it´s ""only""one customer ... but i hope you do care.","April 23, 2018","2    WORLDHOTEL Cristoforo Colombo

154,"Worldhotel Cristoforo Colombo oozes old world charm in modern Milan. Located just on top of a metro stop, it is a well-run and friendly place to stay. Front desk is efficient and professional. The main lobby, with a bar and snacks, is a comfortable place to have a relaxing drink. Breakfasts are plentiful and hotel is in the middle of a lively restaurant and shopping area. My only quibble would be with the size of the rooms -- I stayed there twice in one week (before going and after returning from Lake Como). Granted, I booked a single room each time. They were well-appointed but very small. Luckily the high ceilings helped. But the bed took up most of the space. Still, I'd come here again and would recommend it to others. It also has a spa on premises that looks awfully nice although I didn't use it.","March 25, 2018","2    WORLDHOTEL Cristoforo Colombo

160,"We travelled around Europe staying in mostly 4-5 star hotels like Hilton Berlin, ParkCity Grand Plaza in London etc so this is what I’m comparing our stays to.First impression - the building is in a great locatjon on a busy shopping street that is only two metro stops from the city centre or you can walk there within 20-25 minutes. The building front is grand and hard to miss.Lobby is elegant and spacious.We were upgraded to a slightly larger room which was very spacious and has plenty of storage space, a nice bathroom with toilet and bidet. Pros- location is fabulous. 200m from the metro station. This metro station goes to all lines on the metro system- spacious rooms- English speaking staff who are kind and helpful- good value for money- turn down service - Roberto Cavalli toiletries- robes and slippers - large LG flat screen- double beds (a lot of places in Europe have two single beds put together) - Complimentary minibar restocked daily including Heineken beers and small bottles of spirits, snacks, water and juices (complimentary!) - wifi everywhere (and no hoops to jump through like signing up or logging in your room number etc. you just login and it works) Really brilliant hotel and great value for what you get. I’m going to argue that it’s really a 5 star hotel at 4 star prices. Definitelt staying again. ","January 5, 2018","2    WORLDHOTEL Cristoforo Colombo

There is construction all the way up and down the street which did not distract my sleep but distracted from the beauty of the area. It will be well worth it when gardens in front are complete.

And to enjoy some of their complimentary sweet treats (lollipops, dried fruits, detox water, gums and sweets)We stayed in the Junior Suite connecting to another room ( Executive Category) spacious and perfect in every way. Just note, that some room has an open shower concept, do let them know your preference. In the Suite there is a Nespresso machine and they give you Diptyque Paris shampoo and shower gel. And free movie channel (MBC), usually you won’t find anything to watch on TV except for CNN. Complimentary drinking water is provided everyday and there is Evening turndown service. Breakfast at the restaurant was a treat, beautiful place, delicious food and great coffee and tea. (no additional charge for cappuccino or juice etc)The true gem of the hotel is Mr Stefano and his team. We have certain dietary requirements and several requests due to my mother’s condition and the team fulfilled all of them without any hesitation. A solid team indeed. The concierge what’s app chat is great, the team provided very good recommendations of restaurants and places to visit. They will also provide you with pocket WiFi. The gym and the small salt water pool which also has sauna and steam room was good. Is about 15 mins walk to Duomo area (this is where all the malls and attractions) and nearby (3 mins walk) there is a U2 supermarket.

The location is very convenient within a short walking distance from the city centre and the main sights. There are also plenty of restaurants and bars nearby.Our room was nicely decorated and looked out the courtyard which we very much appreciated as we did not hear any noise from the street.The reason why I deducted one star is that there was hardly any storage in the room. There was no proper wardrobe, just half of an antique wardrobe trunk with 2 small drawers. Same applies to the bathroom; there wasn't any shelfing provided for one's own stuff. I found this a bit disappointing as in my opinion, you shouldn't be forced to live out of your suitcase in a 5-star hotel unless you chose to do so.The staff was very nice and helpful.

My husband exchanged numerous emails with the staff to set up restaurants and tours. When we got to the hotel, we were bleary-eyed and terribly jet-lagged. The front desk staff found a room for us to nap in and refresh ourselves until our room was ready. I have never had a hotel do that for me-ever. The beds were comfortable; the rooms and bathrooms were immaculately clean. The staff was fantastic. I wish I could recall the names of the front desk staff because they were so compassionate and helpful. Alberto helped my husband plan a great day at Lake Como and saved us a lot of money with his advice. The bartender made a drink for me that was just delicious.

202,"This refurbished 19th century palazzo is a living testimony of Rococo style. It awakens memories of those days where beauty and good taste still mattered in everyday life. The floral motif is ubiquitous throughout the hotel, in lobbies, restaurants, facades. Fresh cut flowers adorn hallways at each floor and on dining tables. Most of interior is decorated in soft pastel colours dotted with floral patterns. Although our room is quite small, the designer made efficient use of limited space. Each piece of furniture and fixture is well coordinated to maximise comfort and utility. Housekeeping team is exceptional, and paid meticulous attention to guests’ individual needs. This hotel is located at a chic neighbourhood with numerous bars and trattoria to suit different tastes and budgets.

The pastel fairytale decor whisks you off into an air of Alice in Wonderland, complete with glass jars filled with penny sweets for your indulgence, images of a white bunny on all of their literature and a beautiful white baby grand piano on display in the bar. The welcome is warm and friendly and the rooms are elegant and pretty in an ever so functional way with your every need prethought of and catered for. The spa is definitely worth a visit. So relaxing and unusual in its display.Just a 15minute stroll has you in the heart of the city at the cathedral, so location wise its great. A metro station is currently being built directly outside (not that you would notice from inside the hotel), so this will be a welcomed added amenity to this hotels location.

204,"This hotel is in a great location about 20 minutes walk from the very centre of Milan and the Duomo. We stayed in a twin room on the first floor, which had its own small balcony overlooking the road. Our room was small but well-equipped with a large wardrobe, safe, minibar and a kettle with teas and coffee, and the room was themed in keeping with the Alice in Wonderland design of the hotel. The bathroom was really nice, with a rainfall shower over a large bath. Climate control in the room was very good. They have a menu of extra items you can order from reception which they'll bring you, which included ghd hair straighteners and travel plug adaptors, which was really handy.On arrival, the checkout staff were incredibly friendly and helpful. We were given a complimentary drink in the hotel bar, which is a very pretty room. As part of our stay, we were also given access to the spa, which has a small pool, sauna, steam room and 'emotional shower' (no, me neither). The spa is really beautifully designed and well worth a visit. My only gripe with the hotel is that the mattresses are quite old and hard. You can feel the springs jutting out of it, which really isn't ideal for a 5-star hotel. I would definitely stay here again, providing that the beds are updated. You get a lot more for your money here than in comparable 5-stars I've stayed in (I didn't once feel like there were 'extras' I was constantly being charged for), so I would definitely recommend it.","January 27, 2019","3    Chateau Monfort

The high standard commenced when we arrived early in the morning after 24 hours of travel and were warmly greeted by Olena. She settled us in with a lovely coffee as our check in was organised. The entire process was efficient and smooth. She also organised some tours for us and explained the train timetables as we wanted to visit our relatives. Nothing was too much trouble.We then had a hearty breakfast with loads of choices. There was something for every taste, sweet and savoury. The food was high quality, fresh and well presented. All the staff here deserve credit as they make you feel special and welcome whenever they see you. Rosanna our waitress was always smiling and so friendly. Anita on Reception was a font of knowledge as well and couldn’t do enough for us.The house keepers work their magic everyday. Even when you have left your room in chaos.The property is just stunning. It is well maintained and elegant. There are lovely mirrors everywhere, gorgeous light fittings and plaster decorations on the bedroom walls.

226,"The Radisson Blue Hotel is located in Via Villapizzone in the outskirts of Milan. There is practically nothing around the hotel, like shops (except grocery like a PAM) or restaurants. It is well connected via Bus (57), via train and via tram. The average time to get into Milan is around 30-40 minutes by bus or by tram. The Nr 57 is very regular and it takes you quite central. However, when we booked the hotel, we were looking for a hotel near the San Siro stadion. We even called up the hotel to ask if it was near the stadion and we were told that it was near and easy to get there from the hotel and back. Now, if you look at the map, from a distance perspective its misleading, because it appears close. If you have to take the public transports, it becomes challenging and it might take you more than 30-40 minutes to get to San Siro (and more to get back). By taxi it might be easier on the way there, but impossible on the way back, as you won’t find any.The room we were given (a standard room), was run down, with stains on the walls, on the lamps, mold in the bathroom, the bathroom door all dented and moldy. They are currently refurbishing the rooms and we were offered to upgrade our room for EUR 70 more to a refurbished room with an included breakfast. However, when I asked if we could just get a free upgrade of the room without the breakfast (in order to avoid exactly this kind of situation), we were told that there weren’t any left! ;)Staff is however very friendly. Would I return to this hotel or recommend it? I would certainly recommend other more centrally located hotels which will take you the same time to get into San Siro. All in all, it was a ‘ok’ experience as we did not spend much time in the room.","June 3, 2019","4    Radisson Blu Hotel, Milan

229,"Very good located hotel if you want to enjoy different parts of milano. you will never have longer than 10-15 minutes to the place you want to go. The neighborhood of the hotel are very old buildings like a social weakness area but like i said with taxi you can get within 7-15 minutes wherever you want in milano. The taxi you can order directly at the reception and it will be there within 2-3 minutes. The price is always around 10-15€ to get in the city.The restaurant is very looking, the service is top with a good knowledge and everyone is very friendly.The problem is that we got cold plates at both days so the food was Unfortunately cold too. and for the price i expect a little bit more.The points that arent so good are the room conditions especially the bathroom has some points that arent clean, like the shower,bathtub and the towels had some dirty spots. For me it doesn't mather how old the rooms are, i expect something from a 4 star hotel.The gym is very good with enough variation. The saunas are very small but thats enough, the spa wasnt visited that much. The water quality of the pool wasnt that good it was like a little bit foggy and not so clean, the drain was dirty to with dirty green spots.The price performance ratio is enough to be good. I will come back soon and hope for a cleaner room, warm food and a cleaner pool area.The rest was good and if the negative points would be positive next time this would be a great hotel!

I did not dine there; who wants to pay 15€ for pizza or a dish he can get for half the price nearby ?The only bad point is the TV signal makes you feel like you are back in the 80's and analog TV. Everywhere it's like this (Gym, room, bar). It's just unacceptable. I could also point out that things are damaged left and right in the room or elsewhere... the SPA wasn't working during my stay.Close to the tram (line 12) and the train to MXP or MILAN.","March 28, 2019","4    Radisson Blu Hotel, Milan

250,"Actually came back from here today, I was looking forward to writing the review.Before arriving I informed the hotel I was coming to celebrate my second year anniversary (14/08) and they did not disappoint. Arrived on the Monday to such professional and welcoming staff. We were told we had been upgraded to a king suite and someone would be up to see us soon.Walking in we were greeted by strawberries with chocolate and a lovely note. Five minutes later a bottle of champagne and glasses were brought up to our room, this was a lovely surprise.The room itself was clean and had all the things you would need. The king size bed was comfortable and gave us a great nights sleep- no noise outside. Bathroom had a best feature (husband said it is a must add to review) when refreshing etc you are able to listen to the tv (English channels only news) through a speaker - can be turned down if you want quiet time.Called down for extra milk and tea, these arrived in good time considering we were on the 9th floor again by professional staff.There is a spa and gym available for your leisure. If we needed a taxi we could press M2 and ask them to call before we got down. Be aware the taxi begins charging from the time of the call so make sure you are ready to hop in as soon as they arrive- usually takes them 3-6 minutes to get there.Location is out of the way and local shops bar two or three food and market shops were open during the night and day so did need to taxi out to other areas. Travel from airport- cheaper to hop onto a coach/bus €8 get into the central train station and get a taxi around €20 from there. Taxi from the airport costs roughly €100.Definitely worth the stay and would love to come back in the future.","August 15, 2018","4    Radisson Blu Hotel, Milan

253,"First let's just get it out there: the location is awful. It is in a run down area of Milan, well away from the sights. I was there because I was doing something with the Politechnico, and frankly I imagine that's the only reason anyoneo would be there. But that said...The hotel was really nice. Our room was large, with a cool multi-room suite layout. The beds were comfortable and the bathroom large and modern. They had a very nice range of branded amenities in the bathroom (I'm an amenity snob; I cannot help it, I used to sell little shampoos and conditioners to hotels when I worked for P&G and you can tell a lot about a hotel by the amenities it chooses). It wasn't a brand I was familiar with but my daughter recognized it, and they included the extra things like a toothbrush, shaving kit, etc. See how easy it is to win me over? But I haven't even gotten to the really good stuff. There was a lovely indoor pool that really made the hotel fun for my kids. The water was a little cold for my tastes, but they had a blast, and the benefit of them playing in cooler water is they crash out for hours afterward, so we're all winners. But the BEST part of the hotel is probably the breakfast buffet! First, it's a stylish area with an ample spread. It was definitely higher end than the other breakfast buffets we had while in Italy. But the highlight was definitely the fresh, full-sized vegan croissants!! Score!! We went vegan about six months ago and it's usually hard to find vegan food when we travel. I had pretty much written off things like croissants. But these weren't just vegan croissants, they were EXCEPTIONAL vegan croissants! My kids talked about them for the rest of the trip (and we stayed at four hotels after this one!) They were so good that I'm including a picture. So, Radisson Blu, you had disappointed me in Leeds, but you won me back in Milan. I'm happy we're on good terms again.","July 7, 2018","4    Radisson Blu Hotel, Milan

259,"What more can you ask?This is one of our favourite hotels now.We got there a bit frazzeld by a flight from Edinburgh/45min taxi drive, and slightly early to check in. The 'bellhop' came to take our bags from the taxi, took us inside. The receptionist checked us in straightaway while the bellhop plied us with lemon water. I mentioned to receptionist about our trip to St Moritz on Tues, when a bus (I thought) would be picking us up. Buses dont normally call here, she said, and copied our trip details, phoning us later to say that a SUV would pick us up and driver would wait in reception. In the meantime, the bellhop (I do wish Id taken their names) took us and bags to our room, made sure the air con worked, and arranged for a porter to bring us milk for our tea.The room was on floor 2, near the lift, over looking the courtyard next to the restaurant, protected from the traffic noise by a row of tall trees. There was minimal noise from inside or outside the hotel. The bathroom was great, including a multihead shower room, plenty of storage. The room had loads of wardrobe and drawer space and space for cases, minibar (reasonably priced), safe, TV with English news channels, bedside tables, a comfy club chair and footstool and comfy chair to sit at desk console. Nicely decorated.We couldnt face going out for dinner so went to hotel bar. All items on the main course food menu were between euro 10 and 18. I chose lasagna, he chose macaroni. Both were in an absolutely gorgeous meaty tomatoey sauce. There is only one draft lager in the bar, but it was very good, on a par with Stella. The drinks menu included long cocktails, all for about e12, so we had one each night. We availed ourselves of the bar meals each night after treks round Milan/S Moritz, and found the food great, bar ambience good and friendly.Our booking included breakfast, which although buffet style, was equally good. The hot selection was crispy, very tasty bacon, Italian sausage not to our taste, scrambled eggs, and 'coddled' eggs ie eggs cooked in an egg cup, but just right with runny yolk. Him indoors reckoned really good. There was the usual fruit juice and yoghurt, fresh fruit and cereal selection, loaf bread, croissants and bread buns in all shapes and sizes, and the cold selection defied belief: vast array of cheeses, cold meats, smoked salmon etc etc Lovely atmosphere in the restaurant as in the bar.The hotel is near a small train station, bus route and tram route. We twice used the tram (you can get a ticket from reception), other times we used taxis which reception booked for us.All the staff were really helpful, friendly and professional. I hadnt been expecting it in Italy, and was worried about the language barrier. However, they all spoke very good English.The only negative is that its a little way out of central Milan, so because of the never ending graffiti in Italy the area can look a bit run down (but then so does central Milan with gorgeous buildings covered in stuff Banksy would be ashamed to be associated with).The tram fare each way is e1.50, and taxi about e12.If Im being supremely picky, some of the paintwork in our room was showing signs that its time for a lick of paint, but nothing significantWhats not to like?","May 27, 2018","4    Radisson Blu Hotel, Milan

The staff were fantastic. Helped us in every way. Directions, maps, local information. Can’t speak more highly of them. The rooms were spacious and spotless. Tea and coffee making facilities and a mini fridge. Local supermarket a short walk away. The hotel is very close to the #22 tram and metro so no problem getting back to the centre in about 25-30 minutes. However if you want to be right in the centre with all the city attractions and restaurants at your finger tip then this may not be the hotel for you. There is a great pool which was sadly closed for annual works while we were there. I think the biggest downfall of this hotel is the very high price for breakfast. No doubt perfect for business people putting the cost on an account but absolutely out of the reach of a family of mum dad and a couple of kids staying for a week for example. €25 per person per day. No doubt the food was extensive and lovely but it is absolutely price inhibitive for most, except for a treat. ","May 26, 2018","4    Radisson Blu Hotel, Milan

The cost per night was quite fair for the design week period but there were many extras like a very expensive (but good quality) breakfast, parking facilities city tax.

The reservation was made on 29th March and they tried to take payment quite a few days later and the card had expired on 1st April, but the point is the card should have debited immediately or the day after for confirmation to be sent, and at the very least we should have been contacted to tell us it had been cancelled. We are now in a taxi trying to find another hotel, not a very good start to a birthday surprise trip to Milan organised by my husband and I’m pregnant and the hotel had absolutely no sympathy whatsoever!

303,"This hotel is stuck in a time warp and is not worthy of its 4 star rating nor can it justify its price in any way shape or form. The first thing to note is the layout, it's mind boggyling complex to navigate your way around the hotel. My room was 251 which seemed to be in a weird annex from the rest of the hotel. To get to my mind-boggling I had to pass two extremely annoying sliding doors. One activated by a key and one automatic.The automatic one was very close to my room so every time someone passed through it the sliding mechanism was extremely loud and annoying and travelled into my room.Lets go back to the decor of the hotel and room, it is stuck in the 1970s and I found the hotel itself to havde a creepy vibe to it. In fact it reminded me of the hotel in the Shining.Now to my room itself, every time I opened the door there was a pungeant smell which can only be described as the 1970s deoderant Brut. One plus was that it certainly matched the 1970s decor of the bedroom.Navigating myself to the bathroom I was greeted with the site of a toilet that woukdn't stop flushing.As a light sleeper this constant noise would have resulted in impending insomnia. I called reception to complain and to be fair they despatched two handymen quite quickly. One of them lifted the back of the toilet and after a few seconds of jiggery pokery announced that it was fixed. It appeared to be, but a short time later it was evident that his fix was only temporary. Not wanting to go through the same rigmarole again by calling reception I implemented my own solution which invlolved me having to suspend the cistern by lifting the pulley to an angle that would block the flush. I would then have to repeat this every time I wanted to flush/stop the flush of the toilet. Four star hotel I hear you say.I visited what they call on their advertising a fitness centre, spa and swimming pool. The fitness centre consists of a few running machines, free weights that only go up to 10kg and one machine with only a lat pull down and pec press. The sauna and spa were good to be fair but the swimming pool was tiny and not the size advertised. Also there was a phone in the spa area and a sign saying pick up the phone to order and have a drink brought down from the bar. Surprise surprise this phone does not work. Most of the staff are not friendly or welcoming and seem disinterested. The only thing they seem interested in is your money. One exception was Terence the bar man who is friendly and courteous.The location of the hotel is decent enough and there is a BikeMi rack just outside. It is about a ten minute cycle to the duomo from the hotel.In conclusion, this is the first time I have stayed at a Best Western and it will be the last. I'm guessing they are just playing off their brand name and have become complacent. My advice is that this hotel does not offer value for money and you should consider cheaper and more modern alternaltives if you are planning a trip to Milan.","October 22, 2018","5    Best Western Plus Hotel Galles

The indoor pool was a great addition and we enjoyed using it after exploring the city. We also enjoyed the rooftop terrace to get some afternoon sun.There was plenty of choice at breakfast and we were able to ask staff for a better coffee than the machine stuff.One small negative, our room was right next to some of the lifts and the room service hatch and as a result our room was quiet noisy.

312,"We had one night in Milan before catching our flight the next day out of Linate. We choose this hotel because they had a family style room available -essentially two rooms with a bath and it was centrally located and on the subway so we could get the most out of a very short stay in Milan. Compared to an Airbnb, for one night, this was a preferable location and we wanted a place that would be easy to get a cab to and from for the airport. Usually, when we only have a stopover/one nighter somewhere in Europe where we want to catch a cab easily to an airport, I look to see if there is a Best Western because their family room/suite product is really excellent for families and it is priced reasonably. The rooms are usually updated and modern, even in older historic buildings. This hotel was no exception. Check in was easy. The room was clean -our two teenagers shared the ""living room"" which as two daybeds for them to sleep on. We had a small balcony overlooking a side street. You are right on the corner of the main shopping street, the Corso Buenos Aires. For us, that is all we needed or had time for and our teenagers enjoyed exploring the various shops --and it was the first day of the July sales. So it was very busy! The rooftop restaurant serves a standard European breakfast buffet that we enjoyed. We intended to take advantage of the unique Spa pool on the lower level but never did --but it looked very nice. It was only a 15 min drive in no traffic to Linate Airport to catch a Sunday morning flight. The hotel arranged for a van to take us to the airport. You are also 2-3 blocks from the main rail station to get to MXP airport or express bus to LIN. 4 stars mainly because the staff while nice, not consistently helpful like we've experienced at other BW's in Italy-- but my understanding is this is probably more a reflection on the culture of Milan than the hotel itself.","August 24, 2018","5    Best Western Plus Hotel Galles

314,"We were warmly greeted on arrival to this older hotel. The lifts/elevators are very small. We had two rooms as there were 4 of us so a couple of trips up was needed. Our rooms were very small. The air conditioning wasn't quite up to par. The temperatures in those days were 36 degrees.We had to leave the shutters closed to help defer heat. Our room faced a fairly busy street. When emergency vehicles go by the sirens can wake you but its not an enormous problem. There isn't too much storage in the room although there is an armoire to hang clothing. We did have robes which was nice. Our other room did not for some reason. The bathrooms have the half glass wall to contain water in the shower so you have to make sure that is in place to reduce the water on the floor. The hotel has shampoo, shower gel and lotion but does not provide hair conditioner. If its something you need - bring your own.The breakfast room on the top floor is bright and open and staff there are very very friendly and are constantly working to keep things neat, clean and stocked up for everyone. It has an enormous selection of food items and beverages for everyone. Gluten free, vegetarian, and you can see they try to incorporate many cultural diets. The bar downstairs has a wide range of selections available and a large seating area lounge space to sit. There is a workout space that is smaller and a pool.If we returned we would probably want to try somewhere else for accommodations but this did the trick for us for our short stay in Milan. People that work here are very friendly and welcoming. Checkin and Checkout take quite a while for some reason and a line up forms especially at checkout times. Taxi service is easily obtained by asking the front desk and they arrive promptly. In emails the hotel offers to be of assistance and we did ask the hotel to arrange a ride for us from the airport which they did. The service was there promptly but barely uttered a word to us the entire time. When we had questions they were barely answered. The cost was enormous for the drive in. Later in our trip we had a driver pick us up in Naples and take us all the way to a town down the Amalfi coast. It was hardly much more than what the cost for this ride was. And we were catered to and we stopped for scenery etc etc. and it was a few hours in length. The hotel is close to restaurants and public transportation. There are also lots of shops very close by.","August 20, 2018","5    Best Western Plus Hotel Galles

The room was a little small and we took some time to figure out the air conditioning (still not sure what we actually did but we managed to get it to a good setting somehow!). However, the bed was comfortable and the bathroom was a good size with all the toiletries provided and replenished daily. The breakfast was good although a bit disappointing that the coffee from the machine was very acidic and unpleasant. I really enjoyed the selection of pastries and bread however! The hotel also provided a welcome drink on the day we arrived, which was a nice touch. The hotel is conveniently located next to a metro station and within walking distance of many shops and restaurants. We took a walk to the Duomo which took about 25 minutes so definitely manageable in good weather.

The room was indeed much bigger than i though, just that the additional bed is located in a separate room rather than the bed room. which is totally fine for me. First 3 nights was ok as we spent the timing in the hotel washing up and going to bed. However the last night was unacceptable. At 10pm there were noise from drilling and hammering. I called the reception and a gentleman was kind enough to check the room next to me. After checking he knocked my door and mentioned that there is no one living next to my room. So I requested him to sort it out but he said that it is not within his means to do anything and ask me to bear with the noise. Again... If my 2 year old daughter was not with us, I am ok.

334,"The amenities overall were fine. Nice, fancy looking lounge, room, and breakfast area. Super close to a metro station, a few restaurants/eateries, grocery stores, and gasoline/petrol station. Plenty of underground parking as well if you were driving there. Not sure how well it is connected to the Malpensa airport though (because it is quite far, 60+ km or 40-ish miles away). The person who helped us with reservation and check-in was nice and helpful. He seemed eager to help us have a good stay there. But we did not see him during the remainder of our stay.However, our stay here was not particularly enjoyable. Here is some of the negative feedback that contributed to the not-so-good experience at the hotel:- The quality of the room, furnishings, door, etc. looked good on the surface but they really lacked in details. For instance, there was a big gap between the room door and its frame when locked. See below about my note on the bathroom and the mini-fridge.- Loud construction noise woke us up on the first morning around 7 am. We had no heads up about it from the front desk.- One of the blankets had a fairly big light brown stain on it. It was replaced soon after we brought it to the attention of the front desk.- The mini fridge in the room was incredibly loud. We first thought that the sound was that of loud winds blowing outside.- All the bathroom fittings were fancy but their functionality was very poor. The light above the sink and mirror was poorly place. If you got close to the mirror, you could hardly see your face because of the shadow of your own head. The toilet sink faucet had a massive amount of splash. You had to be very careful in operating it in order to avoid a messy situation.- We experienced very poor operational efficiency with respect to the amenities (we had paid for breakfast but they did not have it on record for one of the days) and even the final billing (they got our final charge the right the 3rd time after we questioned the first two).","May 23, 2019","6    Hilton Garden Inn Milan North

338,Visited Milan for a short break. The standard of the Hotel was first class. Ate in on first night and food was very good along with service. Short walk to nearest Metro station giving access to central area. hotel although busy was not noisy.,"April 18, 2019","6    Hilton Garden Inn Milan North

339,"Although they will have you pay 4-Star prices for the privilege of staying at this abomination of a hotel, the lack of attention to details that separate luxury hotels from garbage dumps just isn't here. To start off, they charge money for plastic bottles of water aside from a ""complimentary"" bottle the front desk will give you on the first night. The next thing you will notice is that they do not provide any luxury items one would expect such as room slippers or bath robes.The cleanliness of the rooms leaves something to be desired as well. We found large dust bunnies that were piled up on the picture above the bed. We continued to sneeze throughout the night, even with the window closed.In the provided picture, you'll see the hole in the wall where a telephone was once installed. Unfortunately, it did not add to the luxury standards that the name ""Hilton"" once stood for.The beds were comfortable enough but the air conditioner didn't seem to work that well in the evening and the room would remain muggy until the early morning hours when it would finally start working.Another item of note is that the staff appears ill-prepared in dealing with the sort of clientele that a 4-Star hotel would attract. They were not able to even provide basic information on the services sold through their in house ""handy"" device. We actually ended up wasting a bunch of time after purchasing the Milan City Pass through their device. We found out later that the discounts offered through the device were for none of the main attractions and many of the advertised services no longer existed with the exception of the 24 hour metro pass. The trick is that you have to go to the office that sells the Milan pass before you can get the Metro tickets. None of the staff at the hotel had any clue about anything. Speaking of their service desk, much like others have said, they seem to lack a certain level of professionalism. The female staff running the Hilton club portion flat out refused to help answer our questions even when they did not have any customers and the other representatives were busy. We had to wait 15 minutes just to talk to one of the other two representatives.On this same topic of customer service, we would also add they lack bell hop service which should be standard for a 4-star establishment.Another issue with the hotel is that it's not in a good neighborhood. While we weren't scared for our lives, seeing graffiti and run down shops right outside the hotel left us scratching our heads as to why they would pick this location for a 4-Star hotel. The hotel is not within walking distance of Duomo so the only way there is to take the metro.The breakfast at the hotel was okay. My wife was not happy with the undercooked scrambled eggs but I was fine with them myself. They had a decent selection of juices (the pineapple juice tasted watered down).If you are planning to come to Milan and want a luxury experience, I would recommend the Hyatt at Duomo for just a few hundred more euros than pay good money for this dumpster fire of a hotel.","April 16, 2019","6    Hilton Garden Inn Milan North

340,"Stayed one night, great value for price; located in mixed residential/business area. Close to metro with easy access to city center. Very attentive and helpful staff. Silvia at front desk was exceptional, went out of way to get reservation corrected. Breakfast was OK, but other services make-up. Hotel has a decent restaurant and others are within walking distance.

341,"This Hilton is approximately 3-4 miles outside of the city center. I chose it because I am a Hilton member AND it was half the price of many other hotels located closer to the center of the city. The reception staff was very nice. The room was comfortable for one and would have been fine for a couple. Shower water was hot! Beds were comfortable. I had a “queen” bed which was really two full size or two double size beds. The hotel fitness center was perfect for a quick sweat. Weights, workout mats, workout bench, two treadmills and two ellipticals. Probably the best part of the gym was the view from the sixth floor. Breakfast wasn’t the best. Very wet eggs. I would have liked to have oatmeal as an option. Lastly, the shower had a towel warmer which I think is a nice touch. Overall, if prices were lower in the center of the city I would have liked to stay downtown but my stay met my expectations. ","April 9, 2019","6    Hilton Garden Inn Milan North

343,"I booked a surprise trip to Milan for my boyfriend. It was our first time in Italy. Booked this hotel through the travel agents. From we arrived until we left everything was fabulous. The staff were all lovely and nothing was too much trouble. A two minute walk from San giovanni metro that took you straight to Duomo (a must see when in Milan) The handy travel buddy available to all guests (a smartphone) was a total surprise and godsend as we walked everywhere n you could use Google maps, make calls and use for free. Thank you to all the amazing staff in an amazing city. We're already planning a return trip to you. See you all soon ","March 29, 2019","6    Hilton Garden Inn Milan North

344,"This hotel is round the corner from the Villa San Giovanni Metro station on the red line. On the map it looks as if the hotel is a bit out of town, but since it's only 15 minutes between VSG and Duomo stations, it is actually very convenient. A single journey ticket is 1.5e and a 48-hour ticket for metro, tram and buses is 8.5e (ticket machines in the stations are multilingual).Getting to the hotel from Malpensa airport by pubic transport was easy. The Malpensa express to Cadrona costs only 13e and takes 50 minutes from terminal 2. At Cadrona you can change to the red metro line for VSG or, if you have a lot of luggage, a taxi from the station might be a better option.The rooms are as you'd expect in a 21st century international hotel: clean crisp bedding, a spacious bathroom with plenty of towels and nice toiletries, blackout curtains, international TV channels. The standard of housekeeping was high with everything very clean. We liked the fridge (a usable size), the small kettle and having a safe. Superb value for money.We didn't eat at the hotel restaurant preferring mostly to go into the city centre. There aren't many restaurants close to the hotel, but we ate twice at Vineria San Giovanni which we liked a lot. It has a very long wine list (all prices), rather good sharing boards and authentic Milanese classics (e.g. risotto, osso bucco and tiramisu). The locals eat at Trattoria San Filippo (Precotto) - extremely popular, mostly open at lunch and we didn't manage to get a table. We also liked the newly opened Lidl supermarket nearby on Viale Monza which has an in-store bakery and is open to 9pm (much posher than UK Lidls).The hotel reception staff were unfailingly helpful. We stayed five nights and were greeted with a smile each time we passed through the lobby.The general area felt safe to us. You're not getting traffic noise from the main thoroughfare as the hotel is parallel to it. The area is a mix of residential and businesses of various kinds. There are some newer flats nearby and areas where demolition has taken place, so some future redevelopment can be expected.Top tip for tourists staying here. Whether you think you like contemporary art or not, the Pirelli HangarBicocca has large-scale installations unlike anything you've ever seen. Take the 51 bus to Via Chiese - it is only half-a-dozen stops or so. The bistro there is very smart too. Open Thursday to Sunday 10am to 10pm. (The Bicocca district is a large post-industrial urban redevelopment with a cinema, some shopping and cafes.)","March 29, 2019","6    Hilton Garden Inn Milan North

356,"This hotel was clean and sleek. It had all the amenities you need in a hotel and i loved that it had a bath where you can just soak and relax after a long day of walking around Milan. It’s not the greatest in location, as you need transport to get you in to the heart of Milan but it was also not a great hassle to get to. It was still a short walk from the nearest metro. My husband loved that our room had a complimentary phone that you can use as you tour around Milan, you can use it as a guide for local food and activities or just to simply use google maps instead of using your own cellular data. I think it was the little things that the hotel had that made a great impression on us.","November 5, 2018","6    Hilton Garden Inn Milan North

358,"Check in was quick and efficient, room was comfortable, Has a mini bar in the room (refrigerator). Wi-Fi was very good. Hotel staff was awesome, we needed to print our boarding pass and they printed multiple copies for us. However, I have to provide extra compliment to Maria, she was so helpful with everything, from getting taxis to restaurant suggestions. She was patient, helpful and detail. Great asset. Location - There wasn't too much activities near the hotel, in fact, we have to walk around a couple of alleyways to get to the front of the hotel, streets were dark and not many people. But the train station is only a couple of blocks away and the metro system is pretty efficient. The ride to the city center is only twenty minutes away, the Cathedral and Galleria mall is one stop closer. The restaurant areas are on the same metro line with one transfer (less than half an hour). Supermarket Coop is a good fifteen - twenty minute walk, but they have everything that you need, the local supermarket is five minutes away, but I don't recommend it, very limited selection. The hotel also do not have any tours for the city, you have to book it at the city center at the visitor center. But overall, nice stay, will definitely return.

361,"My wife and I recently spent a long weekend at this hotel. It is obviously a modern hotel of rather 'minimalist' design, very conveniently situated near the Villa SG metro station (M1 red line) in a quiet residential area of the city (maybe a bit far from the city centre for some, but absolutely fine for us). We were very warmly greeted upon our arrival and, even though we arrived very early (around 11:30am), our room was available. The room was very comfortable, spotlessly clean, spacious and well equipped. The bed was supremely comfortable and this, along with the fact that there was very little noise from either outside or inside the hotel, sleep quality was excellent. The a/c was very powerful and very welcome as it was unseasonably warm outside. The complimentary WiFi was reasonably fast and reliable. We took breakfast at the hotel (a reasonable 10 Euro) and it was very good with plentiful choice and good quality. The room rate was extremely reasonable given the quality of the accommodation. The only negative comment we would make is that it is a pity that the hotel doesn't offer a pool (could be because they are attracting mainly business clientele rather than tourists?). Otherwise, an excellent choice!","September 27, 2018","6    Hilton Garden Inn Milan North

The breakfast room was like a huge cafeteria designed for tour bus groups, not very cosy either. They have a large choice of pastries, meat, cheese, yogourt, cereal - they show vegan options on the room service menu, but it was not possible to have dairy free spread (margarine) or milk for breakfast.Let's say, this hotel is clean and has all the amenities you might expect for the price, period.","August 3, 2018","6    Hilton Garden Inn Milan North

The hotel is a long walk around the San Siro to the metro especially walking it 4 times a day haha. We had trouble with our room as the doors wouldn’t lock so had to move us twice and wasted nearly an hour. The room we eventually moved to wasn’t as good as the first but we was happy the door locked. Would have been a nice gesture for a complimentary drink/breakfast for all the messing about.

398,"I was very happy with my one night stay at the B&B San Siro. Bearing in mind it is a budget hotel and very cheap for Milan, I set my expectations accordingly. Rooms were exactly as shown on the web, basic but modern and nice and clean. I asked for a quiet room and was given one on the 4th floor - it was quiet although you can hear a little traffic noise (very minimal). I did like the layout of the building, an octogan with a couple of rooms on each side - so no noise from the corridor or of the slamming doors of other rooms.I found the staff to be very nice - friendly and polite and gave me a nice recommendation for pizza nearby. Regarding location, the hotel is a 10 minute walk from the metro and from there a 20-minute ride downtown, so it is a little far out for visiting the old centre of Milan (although possible). There is an American diner on site (I didn´t try it - I wanted Italian food) and a nice Italian restaurant about 10 minutes walk down the road. Apart from that, there´s not much else in the area.If you are interested in AC or Inter Milan you will love the location - right in front of the stadium, so great for watching a match, doing the stadium tour or visiting the shop.

For a big person like me the shower can be a bit claustrophobic. The breakfast is extra. It has a poor choice of food selection. Just 1 type of ham and 1 type of cheese cut very small. There is yoghurt and some cereals. 2 hot items only. Scrambled eggs that are very bland and tinned sausages cut in circles. The pastries are good when they are fresh. They keep the old ones and use them the next day. The seating is very uncomfortable and not practical. I gave it a 3 star for the location and cleanliness.

Easy enough to find by car and by public transport. We parked downstairs for the night which was and extra ten euros. Apon check in we had to pay extra for the so called ""tourist tax"" in other words just a surcharge for being a foreigner. Never heard of this before but fair enough. Once paid we headed up to our room on the fifth floor. Nice and quiet.The room was modern, not thoroughly cleaned with stains on the desk and a mark on the bedding but nothing mega considering we were only here for one night. The bed was comfortable, shower was average. We couldn't borrow an ironing board and iron as apparently 99% of Italian hotels don't provide this.

Staff were polite and helpful though, apart from the above. There was no tea or coffee in the room and no fridge which meant that we spent a lot in the hotel lobby. The spot is good for public transport with the no. 16 metro from outside the stadium taking you to the Duomo and the underground is a short walk away. However, there is little to do in the area. There is an American Diner next to the place which is quite nice and a bar down the road but other than that there was little choice. We also walked to the large Supermarket which was around 15-20 minutes away which a member of staff kindly directed us there. On a budget it is not ideal to stay here as you end up spending more on transport. We lived off bread and cheese from the supermarket rather than venturing into Milan every night. This meant we saved money but our taste buds were not satisfied! ","August 14, 2017","7    B&B Hotel Milano San Siro

412,The rooms of this B&B hotel is amazing. Big rooms with big bathrooms. Location wise the hotel is near the Milan bus stop. Metro station is 10 mins walk away. There is an American dinner adjacent to this hotel. But a word of caution to reserve your seat in advance as this is the only hotel in the vicinity and the next nearest place to eat is Mc Donalds which is 15 mins walk away. The neighbour hood is quite and relaxing. A very big stadium is in front and Metro station next to the stadium. To reach the heart of Milan one needs to change two metros. The airports are far away from this place. Since metros dont work at late night we had to take taxi which charged as 100 Euro.

They were quite obviously making comments about us and another English couple we were with in Italian to each other and laughing.

He said ""you are making this very stressful for me"" when I provided the 'incorrect' itinerary number (the one it stated in the email...) but there we go! The room was nice, smelt a little bit but clean with a comfy bed. The metro is more like a 5-10 minute walk but great to be close to as very cheap and convenient if you like to sight see. We were absolutely bitten to DEATH by mosquitos (not so much in the hotel, mostly outside in the day and night) so please take some repellant because it becomes quite unbearable!!

416,"We booked the hotel for a weekend trip in Milan. The location is ok, metro and tram stops in front of the hotel, however there is nothing in this area...closest grocery store is 1km away.Room was clean, strangely no keycard but we had to pin in a 6-digit number every time. Our room was on the side of the riding hall with very strong horse smell, so opening the window was no option. The airco was quite loud, there was no nightstand and plug by the bed, which was a bit uncomfortable. The bed was sooooo comfy, had a perfect sleep both night!!Breakfast was...well...mostly sweet things, they had the worst scrambled eggs so chose the sugar instead :) But as a good point, coffee was really nice! Possibly a must in Italy:)So probably would not choose this hotel again, but if you""re going to a match or concert, then it is perfect!","July 10, 2017","7    B&B Hotel Milano San Siro

417,"Perfectly placed for my work in the stadium, it looks promising. Kind of large, but oddly shaped room. No fridge! No plug sockets near the bed, only on opposite wall. When you turn the bathroom light off, there is one that remains on which is stupid. Also, when you turn off the main light, the aircon turned off some 30 mins later so you wake in a pool of sweat. I found that I could change the aircon language to English and reset the power off behavior thankfully. But really shouldn't have to do that. Instead of a key or card for the door, you are given a 6 number pin code. Rubbish. One saving grace is the fact that they had a well stocked fridge at reception and a night receptionist so we could have late night drinks after work, lthough the old fella was pretty moody. Breakfast was not at all good the one time I made it there. ","June 30, 2017","7    B&B Hotel Milano San Siro

418,"I had an excellent stay at B&B Hotel Milano, spent 8 days close to metro, tram and bus 5 min. walk. It is a bit far from MXP at least 45mins. My recommendation is some sort of contract with Taxi Services for guest to have access to the airport that cost less than 95 euros. I wish they had an Ice Machine being your drinks remained hot unless you choose to spend 3 euros for a small can of coke. You can obtain metro passes from front desk at 4.50 euros for 24 hrs. access that was GREAT!! It's always GREAT to have a go to person prior to your arrival so confirm. Lorenzo was a huge blessing and then I was taken aback on his days off.

422,"Myself and my fiancée stayed here in late March 2017. We stayed for 3 nights after getting a great deal booking through Trip Advisor.Prior to arriving, I emailed the hotel directly asking for a room on a high with a balcony. Sure enough, when we arrived.. my request was catered to. The hotel is directly next to the San Siro Stadio and the view is truly breathtaking.I had forgotten to print our transfer documents for arrival in Bergamo but tickets were avaliable on the flight. These were around €10pp return. There are also plenty of coaches outside Bergamo airport that will take you to Milan Central Station for €5 one way. There are also return transfers to the airport from Milan Central Station to the airport for the same price.Depending on your time of stay in Milan, using the Metro is by far the best way to get around. We stayed for 4 days and bought 2 x two day urban tickets that can be used as often as you like on the Metro for 2 days. This ticket costs €8.25 for the 2 days.When arriving at Milan Central Station, walk around the corner to the Metro. Take the green line to Garibaldi Station (2 stops) and then swap onto the purple line. Take the purple line from Garibaldi to San Siro Stadio (8 stops). When you exit the station, turn left and walk towards the stadium. Looking to the left of the stadium, you'll see the hotel approximately 200m away.Check in is pretty simple. We were greeted by Andrea (Who was fantastic our whole stay). Our passport details were taken and the City Tax was paid. The Tax was €24 for us both. The rate is usually between €3 - €5 pppn.As previously mentioned, Andrea was fantastic our whole stay. He was able to give recommendations for places to eat and drink, directions when needed, was very friendly and spoke great English with us as our Italian is quite limited.The hotel is extremely clean and very modern. The room was of average size and contained a television, hair dryer and desk. The beds were also extremely comfortable for those who are like me and love a good bed. We stayed room only but breakfast is offered upon arrival for around €7 per person. There is also an American restaurant next to the hotel. They kindly gave us a table on our last night without a reservation even though it was extremely busy. The food was really good and cheap.The area around the hotel is extremely quiet. We weren't there during match day, but I'd expect it to be quite noisy then. We would have loved to have seen a match but maybe next time. Being so close to the stadium was great and we took the stadium tour which was €17pp.For those wanting to shop in Milan Centre, take the Metro from San Siro Stadio (Purple line) to Lotto (4 stops) and then switch to the red line. Take the red line from Lotto to San Bagila (10 stops). This will leave you right in the centre of Milan's main shopping area. Go one stop extra on the red line (Duomo) and it will drop you right outside the famous Milan Cathedral.All in all, I'd definitely recommend this hotel for your stay in Milan. It is a little further out of the City Centre but with the area being quiet, being next to the stadium and the breathtaking views of the Centre of Milan, it is definitely worth it.Enjoy your stay in Milano!!","April 2, 2017","7    B&B Hotel Milano San Siro

427,"We stayed here for two nights (11th Jan-13th Jan 2017) as we were watching an AC Milan game across the road from the hotel, San Siro Stadium.We arrived from Malpensa airport, took the Trenord XP1 train to Cadona (£13 each way, bus is cheaper), got a day travelcard (called an urban card in Milan, you can buy a daily card for 4.50 or a two day card for 8.25) at Cadorna and got the M1 line to Lotto, and from Lotto we got the M5 line to San Siro Stadium. Took about 25 mins. The walk from the M5 line to the hotel takes about 10 mins. Check in took longer than I would have expected given that I had paid before my stay and all my detail were given. The gentleman who checked us in picked up the phone while checking us in which I think is rude and definitely held us up but this is the only thing that wasn't perfect about the hotel.The hotel was very cheap but it is modern and clean with lovely showers, good size beds and a little shop downstairs which isn't too badly priced (1.50 euro for a 500ml of water) I asked for a good room as it was my boyfriends birthday and we must have got the best room there was (room 515) - we had a direct view of the stadium. The rooms were really spacious, as were the bathrooms. The heating system in the room was easy to use and control. The best part of this hotel was going to the game and being able to walk back within 5 mins. Amazing. WiFi works in your room and is quick and effective.There is an American diner themed restaurant right next to the hotel which was lovely, burgers and chips range from 4 euro - 12 euro. Lots on offer.I would 100 per cent recommend this hotel. The area hasn't got much to offer other than the stadium but with cheap daily travel, it doesn't really matter.","January 16, 2017","7    B&B Hotel Milano San Siro

431,"We booked this hotel because it was a) right beside the San Siro and b) well priced. Sadly that’s just about all it has going for it. To begin with, the name is misleading – it’s a B&B hotel but for some reason they deem it acceptable to charge extra for their breakfast – unlike almost every other hotel in Milan. This really reduces its value for money. Secondly, when you read that there is nothing nearby, believe that this is the case. The metro is 5-10 minutes walk away if you cut through by the side of the stadium - if however you arrive at night and don’t fancy walking round this empty area, you will take 15-20 minutes to walk the long way round. There is no restaurant (beyond breakfast) in the hotel, and the shop they tote on their web site comprises merely a few packs of Pringles and other unhealthy fare. There is one restaurant next door and one other 5 mins walk away, but in the main you will need to walk 5-10 minutes to the Metro and then another 5-10 minutes beyond it to find anything at all to eat. There are then a few pizza restaurants, a McDonalds and a small supermarket with a rather poor selection. The restaurant next door is fine at a push, as long as you aren’t vegetarian; all veggie/vegan options contain revolting fake meat. We asked for a quiet room with a view of the San Siro. It turns out this is an impossibility as there is a busy road between the hotel and the stadium; this is especially a problem on Friday nights when the local boy racers scream up and down until the wee hours. We ended up with a room on the side of the hotel so no view of our beloved stadium, however it did have a great view of the Milan skyline so not all was lost. The room itself was a decent size (note: the higher in the building the larger the rooms as there are fewer per floor) but it had only one chair, and only two plugs which is completely insufficient. No hospitality tray. The windows had obviously been open all day when we arrived as the room was full of mosquitos, and the walls were spotted with the corpses of their forebears and the blood of previous residents. The room was otherwise clean. The bathroom grout, however, needing a damn good bleaching. The toiletries provided were minimal, but adequate. There was a hairdryer in the bathroom. The shower was powerful and hot water was plentiful. The pillows on the bed were awful, inducing pain within half an hour. I ended up having to put the two tiny ‘for-decoration’ cushions into the pillowcase as a makeshift alternative. The air con was quiet and also quite effective, which was a relief as it was very hot in the room and there was no way you could open the windows and not be eaten alive. There was quite a bit of noise from within the hotel with doors banging. We were on the top floor but did wonder whether the floors below us suffered from noise as the floors are hard. We’ll be back to the San Siro, but we will definitely be trying one of the hotels in the vicinity of the nearby Lotto metro station instead. We would only recommend this hotel for a one night for a match IF you really can’t find anywhere else.","October 10, 2016","7    B&B Hotel Milano San Siro

Location is just 200 Mtrs away from Milan central station. Currently I am staying in this hotel and moment I checked in it was pretty smooth . I was treated with smile by Gentleman name Johnny Giovanni. My check in was smooth and being the Hilton Honours Gold member I was upgraded to executive large room with executive lounge benefits. I was surprised to know that this guy is working in this hotel from last 39 years.

453,"Being our last leg of our little Italian adventure, we decided to treat ourselves and booked in here for 2 nights. When checking in however, we were informed that there was no free WiFi. (I know we don't go on holiday for the WiFi, but to use the internet to be able to plan your day, check in online with the airport and talk to family back home, it comes in handy) we were given the option to sign up to some club/newsletter this than entitled us to free WiFi, rather than pay the €20 for 24hrs. This did disappoint me a little. As well the disappointed look on the receptionist persons face when we said we didn't wanna pay and add the breakfast to our stay. We already paid so much and it seemed like they wanted more money from us. The room however was very nice and clean, and a decent size.

458,"First, I have to disclose :-) that I am a fan of Hilton hotels based on my experience. We needed to stay close to the central railway station in Milan, as we arrived there from Rome by train for just a couple of days. When I saw a Hilton hotel among the others within a walking distance from the station, priced similarly, it was an easy booking decision for me to make. This particular hotel didn't disappoint. Everything was run smoothly, the room was perfect. We needed an extra bed for our kid, and it was delivered instantly. The proximity to the Milan Centrale station is also convenient due to several airport shuttle buses located there. As of 2019 the bus ride to Malpensa airport is 8 euros.","April 2, 2019","8    Hilton Milan

461,"We arrived to several lines at check in and I asked if as a prepaid guest and a Hilton Honors Membership could we get some preferential treatment. They went looking for someone who could help and by the time they got there it was our turn anyway.Our 5 day stay was longer than their typical booking, we were prepaid and I was a Hilton Honors member... so the desk clerk said she’d give us an upgrade to her favorite room. We went to the room and were impressed with the size, although it looked a little worn. We unpacked and my wife went into the bathroom where she found some hairs in the shower. She also noticed the sink was just too close to the toilet and had some concerns over the toothbrushes being in such close proximity to the toilet bowl. I went downstairs to the front desk and asked if we could get a room with a larger bathroom and was told by another friendly desk clerk that all the bathrooms were pretty much the same. When I asked if she could recommend another hotel in the area she suddenly found a junior suite with a larger bathroom... and it happened to be her favorite suite in the hotel.We looked at the room and the bath and we felt it to be acceptable... although again we felt it to be a little worn.The first night was bad. My wife woke up with an allergic reaction to the pillows and we called housekeeping... but got the front desk. When I explained what happened they were very concerned and asked when we planned on leaving the room in order that they could replace the pillows and linens and do a deep cleaning. We gave them a time and left... spending the day touring. They replaced the pillows and bedding and everything seemed ok.We spent the next day in the room as a result of us both suffering from a cold. We had room service the night before and continued with lunch and dinner in the room during our sick day. Ordering was difficult. One one occasion the man taking the order had to come to our room because we couldn’t understand him over the phone. Menu is limited and quality of food is well under prices charged.Next day we left and upon our return discovered the bathroom was not properly cleaned. We took pictures and called housekeeping. Got the front desk and we were asked to send copies of the pictures. We did and when we got downstairs ran into our friend the first desk clerk who heard about our problem and introduced us to a customer service executive who agreed with everything and then told us she’d discuss with housekeeping supervisor... and to have a drink on the house. We explained we’d be happy to buy our own drinks and let them just make sure our room was properly cleaned. We had a drink and dinner. Food quality was marginal and overpriced.Next day we noticed pastry crumbs on the rug from something we ate two days prior... which meant that part of the room was not vacuumed. They also neglected to provide wash cloths. We called housekeeping and got the front desk. Took pics of the rug and sent to our previous contact, answered a knock to reject the hand towels and send him back for wash cloths and went downstairs again.All our friends told us how concerned they were and how they would make it good. We explained all they had to do was have a lady clean the room correctly. They agreed, we went to dinner, Food was “Chef Boyardee” quality at high prices.Next day was uneventful except when we came back to the room we found what appeared to be a clean room.., but... the trash basket in the bathroom was full of our tissues and there was very little toilet paper.We let our friends know, told them not to worry, we’d be leaving in the morning and they even helped arrange for a car to take us to the airport They were truly nice people trying to satisfy us, placate us, very sensitive to our insistence on having a clean room. They even bought our two drinks and two dinners for two nights in a row. Frankly, we had a very pleasant time with them, BUT... we’ll never go back to that hotel. It’s a shame... the location is amazing. The people are kind, virtuous and friendly. If only they could get cleaning people who keep a room clean.

464,"I stayed here on business for two nights. I’m a regular visitor to Milan plus a Hilton Honors member. Have wanted to try this Hotel for a while. What a huge disappointment. Upon entering the lobby looks good and staff friendly and warm. Due to my early arrival the room I had checked in online was not ready. I was expecting and prepared to wait. However the Reception gentleman advised he was going to upgrade me to a room on the 9th floor. That sounded good to me. My heart sunk when I entered the unrenovated tired and old room. It was large but....... I travel a lot and can not recall ever seeing a TV not in front of the bed. I didn’t use it but would have been a major issue for someone who enjoys winding down watching some tv. They would have had to sit on the desk chair and look across to the wall on the other side. Such a simple solution to move the desk and bed. Beyond logic to me. The curtains were out the arc with a fabric covered pelmet which went across the ceiling. This can only be 1970s. Then no PowerPoint where the kettle is. You have to take the kettle over to the desk to boil water. The bathroom was large but so outdated with ghastly shower curtain and a mission to comprehend how to turn on the tap. Only after did I see the instructions on the wall to turn on a tap!The lighting in the bathroom is so bright one needs to wear sunglasses. Another first for me. The air conditioner I wanted switched off which I did successfully but on off it made a terrible racket. On reporting the noise to Reception it was immediately rectified. Very helpful and pleasant staff. Next was trying to charge various devices. Not nearly enough power points and most were so old they didn’t work. I moved furniture to use better power outlets. The bed was comfortable and room was quiet and clean. The breakfast was good and more than enough to choose from for myself however I wouldn’t call it amazing like others have done. I left a sweater behind on the chair the first morning. Only realised the next day. After querying I was told all items found in the breakfast room get handed to the Concierge. The Concierge on duty that morning said two items were indeed handed in the day before but they were not there anymore. So I guess someone else claimed my sweater. Not the Hotels fault but nevertheless disappointing. All in all the Staff were great, the lobby attractive but the room was really not up to standard for the rates. Fortunately I got a good deal but would never pay over 300 euros per night for one person for this kind of accommodation. The Hilton Garden Inn Milan North is better value for money with great rooms. I did receive an email from the Hotel advising I would get a better room on the executive floor for my next stay. I appreciate the gesture but I won’t be returning to this particular Hilton.","March 20, 2019","8    Hilton Milan

466,"As a Hilton honors and long lasting customer of the chain I can easily say this is the worst Hilton I’ve stayed in by a mile and I’ve stayed in 25 plus Hiltons globally. Tried to check in early with my wife and three year old. Got served by the tall bald guy that was impolite, bad mannered and looked very scruffy. Our room wasn’t ready so he gave us a room on the 9th floor that didn’t fit a baby cot. Room was old and reminded me of the 90’s. Went back down and decided to wait for our room. Waited for half hour forty minutes giving them plenty of time to clean and prepare our room which was available but just not ready but still nothing. Front desk guy looked like he couldn’t care less. We decided to go out for the day even though we traveled all morning as we were just there for one day before our early flight. Turns out it was the best decision as the worst part of Milan was this hotel and it’s ridiculous staff. People in Milan are generally rude and aggressive but you’d think that Hilton would find a few people that broke the stereotype to employ but they failed miserably. Come back to hotel at night, asked the concierge for scales to weigh our luggage but couldn’t have them as they were locked in a drawer and the keys were with the concierge that starts wok at 11pm and this was not an accident but policy I was repeatedly informed. What a joke. On check out same old madness. Lorenzo came picked up our bags from the room and I asked him to weigh them when he goes down as it was now 3 am. Needless to say he ignored me. I asked him again when I went down and he didn’t want to do it so his colleague tried to do it. Turns out the scales don’t work. Then Lorenzo started shouting to my wife as he was refusing to help and check out seemed like rocket science. Cut long story short luckily we spent there just a few hours and would advise anyone with a little dignity to stat away from this embarrassment. Even the other room we got on the forth floor had no resemblance to a Hilton. The bathrooms were old and dirty. Stay away. ","March 10, 2019","8    Hilton Milan

469,"I made a solo weekend tourist visit to the Hilton Milan, arriving on a Saturday morning and leaving Monday morning. I am a Hilton Gold member and used points for the stay. I was able to check-in online the day before, but upon arrival, I was upgraded and given a 4th floor room overlooking the street about 3.5 hours before the check-in time.My room was fine, a little on the small size, but with a comfortable king-size bed, and a decent sized bathroom. The in-room fridge was mini-bar only and the prices were as you would normally see (ridiculous). However, as a Gold member, I was provided with a coupon for 3 free items (or an cleaned/ironed shirt, 15% off dinner or breakfast-in-bed).The staff was wonderful. From the doormen, to the concierge, to the front desk staff to the restaurant staff, everyone spoke excellent English and were uniformly friendly and efficient. The lobby is very attractive and while I did not eat in the main restaurant, it looked excellent, albeit with slightly higher than expected pricing. Breakfast was included in my room (20E otherwise) and was one of the best non-Hawaiian breakfast buffets I have had. There was a lot of everything, from local dishes to dim sum to a fresh omelet station, fresh orange juice machine, etc. Fantastic.The hotel is about a block from Milan Central train station, which is more central for business than tourists, and the area is a little dead during the weekend. There is a parking garage adjacent to the hotel and a taxi stand right in front. The main tourist areas are a few stops away on the subway and it is a must to get an ATM transit pass, which includes off-on privileges on the subway, buses and trams and can get you pretty much anywhere in the city (even out to the San Siro) in 20 minutes.In all, I was very happy with my stay and would absolutely return and recommend this very well-run hotel.","February 12, 2019","8    Hilton Milan

We tend to stay in Hiltons as my boyfriend is a member of the Hilton Honours Scheme so this looked great.Hotel itself is very nice - clean, modern, spacious and well equipped. We had a room on the third floor, couldn't complain about it as had everything we needed. We had been upgraded to the executive lounge through the Hilton Honours scheme was great, this meant we could go for breakfast/ refreshments throughout the day/ food and alcoholic drinks between a certain time period on the evening which we always made use of. The only downside personally would have been the breakfast in the main area as this was always busy and there was little food left when we arrived (but I think that may have been down to the time of year and with it being very busy).Staff at the hotel were also great, very accommodating and happy to help with our queries! Check in/out was hassle free, and they were kind enough to give us some vouchers to get so many items from the mini bar free of charge. We also asked for some advice on a day trip to Lake Como and places to eat, and the staff were great (can't remember names - apologies) but they printed out travel times, advised on where to get the train and things to do, and even rang a restaurant to book us a meal one evening.Location was great for us, if you like to walk it was only around 30 minutes to the Cathedral and main square (with plenty to see in between - shops, bars, restaurants etc.) or you could catch a train at the central station which is literally just around the corner from the hotel and doesn't take long.

As I see it this is standard Hilton property and you pretty much get what you'd expect from that.What makes this place extra nice is its proximity to the Milan Central Train Station (which is a short 5 min walk away). You can get a direct train from the Malpensa Airport (MXP) to here as well as trains to Rome, Venice, etc. It is also a transit hub so you can get on the Milan subway here to (It's only 2 or 3 short stops to many tourist destinations).My room appeared to be a little bit on the older side but was overall very good; large comfortable bed, quite, good space for working, plenty of closet space, etc. It was on the top floor and had a large walk out patio with chairs and a small table (which would have been very lovely if it was summer). My only nit picky complaints would be that 1) the switches for turning the lights on and off were in unintuitive places and 2) The shower/tub had a curtain rather than a door (I always find that shower curtains either get the floor wet are billow into the shower and stick to you body).","December 31, 2018","8    Hilton Milan

I had a sophisticated New/Old Europe ambience and staff that made me feel like I paid a whole lot more for my room.We got in a little late and had some water and a cocktail from the mini-bar. I wish I had written down what the little cocktail was, as I have been craving another like it since that night.Next morning, great buffet. Many choices, ultra clean restaurant. Then parked our luggage with the concierge while we took in Milan for the day until an evening train to Rome.Extremely happy with this stay.","December 19, 2018","8    Hilton Milan

483,"We stayed for three nights as part of a package which included the train fares (we travelled by train from London). The hotel is very near Central Station and therefore extremely convenient. The rooms were excellent, and the breakfast was extensive, plentiful and delicious.The staff were so helpful and nice. We would have been far from their most distinguished or lucrative guests, but they treated us with great kindness and efficiency. I would particularly like to commend the concierge, Mr Pio Torrone, who helped us plan our visit (and particularly using the trams, for which it's difficult to get a map), and recommended a wonderful restaurant for our last evening. He ensured that the restaurant knew we were coming and they too treated us beautifully (I have reviewed them separately).For such a large hotel to make us feel so personally welcome and looked-after was really impressive.","December 18, 2018","8    Hilton Milan

484,"Stayed at the Hilton Milan from 15th - 16th December and found overall stay was pleasant. The hotel is conveniently located a few minutes walk from Milan Central Railway station. The hotel lobby is very nice from moment of arrival with a holiday display in centre of lobby, a very lively bar and friendly check in staff. I was thanked on arrival for being a Diamond member and promptly checked in with a room on 6th floor. The representative was nice to present me a map of the area and direct me to best places to go being my first time. I also was escorted to the lift and directed to my floor which was above and beyond Hilton standard as I normally only see that at Conrad or Waldorf Astoria properties. There was also an executive lounge I was offered to check out and was a pleasant place to relax and unwind.The room was nicely appointed and look decent with nice furniture and no signs of wear. The size was decent for a standard room.I had breakfast in the lobby level restaurant and found the food was very good and plenty of selection. Again the staff were nice and accommodating from time of arrival to departure always ensuring I was taken care of and happy with service.I was thanked again for my loyalty on checkout. I would recommend this hotel and personally hope to stay again.","December 17, 2018","8    Hilton Milan

525,"I stayed at this boutique hotel for two nights. The location cannot be better. You are literally 20 steps away from Milan Cathedral, 10 steps away from Galleria Vittorio Emanuelle and less than 10 minutes walk from the Fashion Quartier. The hotel has beautiful rooms and the customer service is very warm and helpful. The only reason why I haven't give 5 stars is the breakfast as cooked breakfast such as omelette is charged separated. Also the coffee is machine made although if you ask they happily make you a proper one. ","January 8, 2019","9    Room Mate Giulia

Also, the rooms were very spacious and clean, and the location was right at the center, next to Duomo. We would like to especially thank the following staff who have been great with us, Pietro, Claudia, Sara, Andrea A., Andrea P., Bernardo, and Sidy. They were very welcoming, always had a smile on, listened to our needs and helped us. Also, it was my mom’s birthday, and Andrea was so kind to get us a cake while we were out so that we could surprise her. After we left the hotel, we stayed at a 5-star hotel in Paris, however, we had a much more pleasant experience and had better service at Room Mate Giulia. We had a very positive experience at this hotel and would definitely come back if we visit Milan again.","December 31, 2018","9    Room Mate Giulia

539,"My husband and I stayed here for our honeymoon and it is one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in. It is extremely clean, location is perfect and very central and the design of the rooms and hotel space is stunning. We are big lovers of Mid-Century Modern and really loved the design aspects. On arrival we were welcomed by a man (and we could never find out what his name was) but he was so wonderful and arranged for a bottle of prosecco and chocolates in our room. The room was also ready early for us which was so lovely. His help and welcome was the stand out service of our entire honeymoon.However, after that first check in encounter the service greatly varied. As I mentioned our first staff member we encountered was amazing and I wish we knew his name. Hopefully it's on file as he really made a big impression on us. We also found the recommendation from the Food Tasting representative very good - he was great! But the remaining staff at reception provided poor advice on day trips, didn't follow up on requests and at times seemed too busy or slightly annoyed by our questions and requests for advice. We had issues with housekeeping throwing away documents, flyers and coffee vouchers so we ended up having to hide everything from them to ensure that we didn't have to visit reception again to get more flyers/vouchers. It was very strange. Whenever we would order room service (a glass of wine or coffee) it would take two or more follow up phone calls and 30 minutes later we would have our glass of wine. The lady who would organise apertivo was lovely and very kind and she was very efficient but because the only way to order was to call reception, many requests were never passed on to her. It was very frustrating and in the end we would just head downstairs and speak directly were the food and beverage assistant and she would help us. This is a beautiful hotel with good service and I would definitely stay here again but the service overall could be improved.","October 15, 2018","9    Room Mate Giulia

This is a sister property of a hotel we stayed at in Turin and I found that hotel to be a step above this one. Spadari just doesn't have the details to raise it to the same level as other hotels. That said - the location is excellent and there is nothing wrong with this hotel so if you want convenience and just needs a hotel to see the sights, then this would be a good fit.

Free water and soft drinks is an extra that was greatly appreciated during last week’s heat wave! Just make sure you request a room at high floor because despite the double glazing if you are a light sleeper you may be bothered by the tram.

Being so near the Duomo is a wonderful and we went everyday. Having a view of the Madonnina al Duomo is unique to this location if you are fortunate to be on the top floors and facing the Duomo.

571,"Stayed at Hotel Spadari for 3 nights in the Spring while visiting Milan - and experiencing all that the city has to offer, history, good food, and good wine! Spadari was booked by our travel agent who told us it was in a good walking location just minutes from the Duomo piazza, La Scala and the Galleria for shopping. We arrived late in the evening after a long train ride, and the gentlemen behind the desk quickly called a nearby restaurant and had them wait for us for a quick meal - it was that kind of personal service that lasted throughout our stay at Spadari. The rooms were clean and nicely appointed, the breakfast was delicious (fruit, meats, eggs to order, homemade coffee cakes) and the location was perfect. Only note is that the hotel is on the trolley line, so you should ask for a room not on the front of the hotel, or at least higher up.","April 16, 2019","10    Hotel Spadari al Duomo

The hotel is situated a few minutes walk away from the hustle and bustle of the duomo. The room we had was spacious 74, the bed was comfortable and laid with white bed linen sheets. Quite unusual to find these days as most hotels use cottton linings. The bathroom is also spacious and equipped with enough toiletries. It is exceptionally clean. The amazing thing about this hotel is that all items from the mini bar are free except for alcoholic beverages. Their breakfast is also good even though, I personally was craving for smoked salmon. I hope they’ll include it in their breakfast. Every single staff from the reception , cleaning ladies to the bellman were nice, professional and polite. I highly recommend this hotel.

As it was our last hotel we upgraded to a Special Superior with Terrace. The room was ample in size and well appointed, with a modern, pristine fitout. The room was spotlessly clean. Very comfortable. The bed, luxurious! Staff were lovely and helpful and quick with advice on local sights. In fact, there is a pamphlet in the room in which each of the front office staff advise on their favourite parts of Milan, sights and experiences we explored on a couple of days. The hotel is incredibly well located with a short walk to the Duomo and the Sforza Castle museums and, of course, shopping! For a hotel that is so well located we found it to be very quiet.

602,"My husband and I got the presidential suite for a night in Milan in this hotel, we where both very disappointed. First of all service is not good at all. After breakfast, we went to the front desk to ask for information about the spa because it was too early and it was closed, that’s when we encountered Lorenza. Not only she was not smiling, she was also not nice and not helpful at all to us, considering that she is an employee of a front desk of a “good hotel”. She made very clear that she could not provide the information we needed in the worst way possible. We understood right away that there is no relationship and/or communication between the hotel and the spa, but we just wanted to know a little bit more about the prices or at least the services they offered, no intention to book a reservation at that moment, so we suggested her to tell the hotel management about it. She kept repeating as if we did not comprehended what she was trying to say in a very rude way: “you can’t make reservation for the spa so why should we know.” So right away we noticed that it was was her who did not understand well our English or our intentions which would have been completely ok if she would have just have been nice. Maybe you should consider changing her position with Aziz who was very helpful, great attitude, always smiling and probably speaks more languages than Lorenza. Remember that the front desk is the face of a hotel, smiling and being nice to the customers , or at least listening them before you respond rudely, should be a basic requirement for the position, after all they are paying a few hundreds of dollars for a room in this hotel. Second of all the room was spacious and not dirty, but the bed we told we would sleep in was a king bed, and it was actually two smaller bed put together, feeling the separation in the middle all night, and not comfortable at all. No luxury. Something that we where not even considering complaining about, but since Lorenza ruined our mood first thing in the morning we decided not to be quiet about it either. We are giving 2 stars just because of the wayAziz treated us.","April 25, 2019","11    Ramada Plaza by Wyndham Milano

603,"Hotel and rooms are nice enough, however breakfast was a nightmare. Over crowded, no food left, asked staff if we could order something from the kitchen as the buffet was empty, he was extremely rude and told us it would cost extra. Each morning we were woken by cleaners bashing hoovers and brooms against the door and wall in the corridor. To top it off we planned our check out to catch the shuttle to the central station, as we were checking out ten minutes before the shuttle was due to leave we watched it drive away. Asked the staff if that was our shuttle, she said yes, that yesterday it had been caught in traffic so it left early today. Not much use for us as no alternative was offered, we were left to do the 10 minute walk to the metro, pay for a ticket and make 2 changes with all our luggage. Not ideal when you have a full day of travelling ahead. Really disappointed. The neighbourhood the hotel is situated in is not nice either. Did not feel comfortable walking to and from the metro at night. If we returned to Milan would defiantly stay closer to the centre of the city.

The hotel is well maintained and the front desk staff is really courteous. I was upgraded to a superior room as I was traveling on my Honeymoon. The breakfast buffet was nicely spread. Shuttle service till central station is available almost every half an hour in morning hours. The room was spacious and the balcony was good. The only problem I faced was with the air-conditioning as it was on heater mode and it got really hot at night and it couldn't be turned off. I had to call reception to get it switched off.How to reach Ramada from Malpensa Airport ?My flight landed in Malpensa Airport (Mpx) and I took a train from Malpensa Airporto Terminal 1 till Milano Cardona which costed me approx €26.

Plastered peeling off the walls by the side of the bed and the hairdryer in the bathroom over heats and cuts out after 5 minutes so suggest taking your own! Breakfast was poor, it is continental so you have your usual cakes, croissants, cereal but the hot food was a poor selection.

608,Spent 3 nights at this hotel in August for a birthday celebration.Rooms well equipped with a nice balcony.Breakfast had a good choice.Used the hotel shuttle bus a couple of times.Small pool in grounds which was great to cool off in.There are not many restaurants near the hotel and it is a few stops into central Milan but a good hotel for a short city break.,"November 8, 2018","11    Ramada Plaza by Wyndham Milano

609,"sparklingly clean and big rooms with big balcony. Nice and friendly staff. Just walking distance from a lot of restaurants. I would love to rate a delicious and nit pricey restaurant near the hotel but cant remember the name, best carbonara ive tasted.. so far! walking distance to the metro if you want to go to Duomo for 1.5€. breakfast is not fancy but good enough to start your day! nice bar too. Book your taxi to and from airport, the same as taxi charge if you get it from outside, and youll be alot safer with their friendly, respectful and nice drivers who also speaks english","October 28, 2018","11    Ramada Plaza by Wyndham Milano

610,"Room was nice. Be sure to have necessary adapter. staff was ok to poor. breakfast was good. Still cannot believe the front desk asked for a cash deposit to loan an adapter. My room was at the last building (4) and had not brought my wallet to give the deposit. Had to go back to my room, get wallet, and then back to the front desk, get adapter, then go back to my room. completely unnecessary. Agree with Andreas S the hotel ""leaves something to be desired"". Thought it was closer to the train station. but nice walk to subway station. did not see anything around to eat. There was a little supermarket close by.","October 22, 2018","11    Ramada Plaza by Wyndham Milano

611,"Spent 5 nights here in October and although the executive double room was decent, the extra bed was so-so and the hotel had switched off the AC already. It was 27 degrees outside abd very warm in the room and it was too noisy to leave the doors open at night.Breakfast is ok, but nothing more. Also, we made the mistake of trying room service one night. The club sandwich tasted like it was made hours ago and the burger, well suffice to say I only ate the fries.","October 11, 2018","11    Ramada Plaza by Wyndham Milano

612,"This large complex is easy to reach with public transport (nearest metro station is Turro, 10 mins away from here), despite it's not situated in the city centre. I had a junior suite at the 4th floor and my room was spacious, perfectly cleaned and with all the amenities and services I needed during my stay. The junior suite also has a large balcony, a living room with sofa and a table, a large cloakroom with a safe, 2 smart tvs, free wifi, minibar and a complimentary coffee station (very useful). Pillows and bed are super comfy and I slept well with zero noise, despite my room ovelooked a street. I really appreciated the breakfast at the ramada hotel because it's large with a great selection of foods. Staff is always present, helpful, smiling and despite this complex is large and separated in different buildings you can easily find someone everywhere ready to help you. In this complex you can find a lot of services: restaurants, meeting rooms, private parking, swimming pool, a garden, fitness room, shuttle service etc. All this services compensate well the location, that is not properly the best in Milan.

613,"We booked 3 double rooms for 2 nights. Even all rooms were under same reservation we were not allocated next to each other which was very upsetting. Very big and busy hotel, the lobby was always full of people. front desk work 24/7 which was a plus for us as we left 3am. They were kind enough to make us breakfast to go as we missed breakfast due to early check-out.Rooms are huge , the bath is luxuries.We were with a big van and parking is very bug so no problems there. Breakfast is great with large selection. distance from metro is about 5-7min walk and than a metro of 8 stations, very quick. However the return walk from metro to hotel is not so nice, dark street and not feel so comfortable. this is the only reason why this hotel gets 4 and not 5 start.","October 1, 2018","11    Ramada Plaza by Wyndham Milano

The normal rooms are very modern, having a great size and a balcony. There is also a small pool (it was closed while our complete stay) and a gym with quiet old fitness equipment. The breakfast ist very small and most things were not very tasty in my opinion so you should better try to have a you breakfast directly in the city center. All in all I have to say the price performance ratio is good in general but you shouldn’t expect to much.","September 19, 2018","11    Ramada Plaza by Wyndham Milano

616,"My wife and I visited Milan and stayed at the Ramada Plaza Milano. Got to the hotel using public transport from Milan Linate Airport. Buy a ticket just outside arrivals, get on the Bus number 73 that stops near the ticket machines. This bus goes to the heart of Milan, DUOMO. From there get the Metro (RED LINE) to TURRO. This costs EURO 1.50 each – cheap! Each single journey ticket lasts for 90 minutes. The hotel is about 7 minutes’ walk with a suitcase. The whole journey took an hour. Turro is a rough looking area but it is fairly safe. It is situated away from the main town in a residential area where many of the local businesses are shut. We arrived on a Wednesday and there was a street market selling all sorts on the street next to the hotel. The hotel is fairly modern with majority of the staff being friendly and speak very good English. As we were early, we stored our bags and headed into town using the hotel’s free shuttle service (one way only and max. eight passengers). On our way back, we got a 48hrs ATM transport pass, this costs EURO 8.25 each. Unfortunately, our room on the 5th Floor, had a disgusting smell, we got a room change to the 2nd Floor and the smell was still lingering. It is probably in the drains or in the air conditioning system. This second room was designed for disabled guests with a very large bathroom. Anyway, we got a third room in ‘B’ Block on the 4th Floor, this room was perfect. Room had a hairdryer, tea & coffee facilities, mini bar and a safe. Thank you to the apprentice receptionist. She was also very good in provided local information.There is a bar, a restaurant and a supermarket across the road from the hotel. I did use the supermarket to get some bottled water. The continental breakfast is good for the hotel’s rating, it has got fruits, cold meats, hot food, cakes and teas and coffee machines. If you to order something extra e.g. an omelette, then you have to pay. We did not use the hotel facilities (pool, gym & SPA) as we were out most of the day sightseeing in this lovely city. However, I did use the computer room to check up on my emails etc. The printer was out of ink and there was no replacement ink cartridge. A bit disappointed with that, as I had an urgent document to print and read. Upon checking out, visitors to Milan have to pay tourist tax of EURO 5 per person per day. As public transport is very reliable and cheap, we used it on our return journey to the airport.","August 24, 2018","11    Ramada Plaza by Wyndham Milano

617,"We stayed in this hotel for 2 nights, the room was very lovely, including a large nice balcony with a view of the park behind the hotel. The bathroom was very nice, too. They have an outdoor pool which is small but very nice. Our room reservation included free breakfast and the food selection was amazing! One of us has celiac disease and he may consume only a gluten-free diet and another one has a lactose intolerance. The restaurant manager was ready for us not only welcoming us but making sure that no cross-contamination would take place either breakfast morning. She is an excellent manager! So basically, we had a lot of choice even for those of us who followed a gluten free or lactose intolerance. Breakfast was a special part of our morning! The hotel is less than five minutes walk from the Turro station in the Milan red metro, this made it very accessible to many places served by the metro. The area where the hotel is located is residential but not central– yet it is very safe to walk at any time, there are few restaurants nearby, we suggest Mamma Farina, it is worth a visit although it doesn't offer a specific gluten free menu (for gf go to Il Papiro instead). Across the street from the entrance there is a cheap grocery store, if you need to buy water or soda for your minibar. Basically we had a lovely experience at this hotel, we found our rooms to be big and they were clean with fresh towels, sheets and pillows, the air conditioning in the room made our stay enjoyable. The entire staff was amazingly friendly from check in through check out! They also have a free shuttle that took us to the main train station after check out.

619,"We stayed in a suite, for 3 nights, suite is lovely, very big, includes a lounge which has - mini fridge, desk, sofa, chair, TV and tea/coffee making unit. There is a separate bedroom (large superking bed) – and a walk-in wardrobe room, two large balconies, and the bathroom is very nice. We did visit the restaurant on the first night, it was fine, only problem was they did have allergy alerts on the menu (I am Gluten-free). Clearly stated the steak, Veg and potatoes had no wheat/gluten, so I ordered it, they advised I could not have to potatoes, so I just had veg and steak – still paid the same though. Also no deserts except ice cream available for GF. So basically, not a lot of choice if you are on a special diet. Breakfast was fine, nothing special! 2 mornings I got some gluten free muesli, but then they ran out!! We walked to the train station, and got the tube into Milan, which was easy. The area where the hotel is – this is inner city, safe to walk in though, few local restaurants nearby. Opposite a Penny Market – which is little supermarket with great prices on beer, water etc to put into your fridge. I used the spa – which was relaxing. The outdoor pool was small, but lovely and cold for a quick swim to cool off after a day in Milan.Overall the hotel is lovely, rooms are big and cleaned every day with fresh towels etc. car park is free, good air con in the rooms. Lovely staff! Clean and well-kept gardens, pool bar (expensive drinks) and outdoor seating area in the gardens.","July 17, 2018","11    Ramada Plaza by Wyndham Milano

622,"This place was really clean an modern with spacious rooms. The location is decent, it’s not central but it’s only 10 mins trip on tube to central milan (Duomo) with a 10 mins walk from hotel to tube station. The staff were really pleasant and helpful. The first room had an adjoining room with a door - when we realised someone was in the next room we could hear a lot of what they did. We asked to move rooms and they did this for us straight away. So just be careful if you get one of these rooms and check if anyone is staying - if you’re a light sleeper it may be an issue. Hotel has a nice (small) outdoor pool and recreation area. Recommended. Also note that a nightly tourism charge is applied on top of the room cost on checkout which was £5 per person per night - I assume it applies to all hotels in Milan.","June 18, 2018","11    Ramada Plaza by Wyndham Milano

624,Visited as a group of friends who wanted a classy hotel on the outskirts of Milan and it is just that. A ten minute drive from the centre and within walking distance to the metro this hotel offers great value for money. One of the main attractions for us was also the offer of the outdoor pool and area which is beautiful- although the pool is rather cold. There’s a lovely spa on site that you can pay €10 to enjoy the facilities whilst staying there which is good value for money. We had breakfast included which offered a food selection and the rooms were modern and comfortable with a balcony. You MUST visit the bar and restaurant opposite with friendly staff and amazing quality for amazing prices! There’s also a supermarket that is really cheap too. ,"June 2, 2018","11    Ramada Plaza by Wyndham Milano

625,"When I first saw the hotel from outside I was dissapointed. It is just grey concrete and old. But things change when you enter the building. It is totally reinnovated. The rooms are very spacey with wooden floors. Everything you need is there. The bed is big but I found the mattress relatively rigid. Everything inside the room is new and very clean. The breakfast is basic but the have some fresh cakes. My basic problem was the food that was not appropriate for a 4 star hotel. No fantasy in the tastes, nothing special in their plates, no nothing (for lunch). Their restaurant for dinner is better but in the same pace. This is something the hotel must change. The neighborhood was safe to walk, which is important since it is outside center and you will need to go to the metro which is a 5-10 mins walk from the hotel. I liked the hotel very good and if they fix their food then I will get back!","May 28, 2018","11    Ramada Plaza by Wyndham Milano

626,"If you want a top hotel out of the tourist area, then look no further! Ramada Plaza Milano has everything that you expect from a 4* hotel. Bed & Breakfast, Bar, Swimming Pool & Spa. There are a range of restaurants and bars around the area if you dont feel like heading into the centre of milan (10 minute walk to the metro - nearest station is TURRO). The staff in the hotel are very friendly and are willing to help you. Speak very good English (also heard a couple of them speak Spanish). All staff members that we saw in the morning all said Good Morning (Bonjourno). There where a couple of occasions where we had to ask for some more milk or teabags but apart from that nothing else to really say. Excellent choice of breakfast. You are able to choose from a traditional continental breakfast - Pastries and Cakes to Fruit, cheese and salami choices. You can even chose to have cereal, toast, muffin, bacon, sausage etc... aswell as a selection of yogurts and hot drinks. The hotel are able to arrange a taxi pick up service to and from the centre and airport. Without staying in the hotel it does give the impression to only cater for business but far from it.

628,"We stayed for 3 nights in an executive room over Easter. The room was nice with a large bed, pleasant decor and a balcony overlooking the garden. There was no kitchen which was shown when booking the room via easyJet holidays and a TV too small for the size of the room. Breakfast is what you would expect in a three star hotel. You get your usual foods but fried eggs, omelettes and others are charged at an extra cost which is something completely new to me and quite shocking to say the least - see image for charges.The outdoor swimming pool and mini-golf are way too small for the size of the hotel and only open in the summer months.The spa is closed on Mondays and not available for children under 12. The hotel also offers free bike rental however children’s bikes are not available - both mean families with young children may have difficulty doing any activity together.Hotel staff are polite on the whole - I found the Italian people to be extremely friendly compared to other European countries I’ve visited.Unfortunately one maid burst into our room without knocking in the afternoon assuming we were out- not good.The location is okay - 1hr from Malpensa airport via train & metro for £10 per person and 20 minutes to the Duomo city centre (7 min walk to the metro plus 12 mins journey). Public transport is far more economical than transfers, uber etc.As the hotel does not cater for children very well at all we done some research and discovered a park was a minute away which is nice in warmer weather and a decent bowling alley & arcade a 10 minute walk away. Neither were advised by the hotel staff when asked what activities are nearby for young kids.Milan EuroPark is a large funfair an hour away by metro & bus which is great for kids and teens for a fun day out. - about 17 euros each.We ate at a Turkish place just outside Turro Metro station where you can get very good food and pizza but not so good customer service. Overall I would give the hotel a 6/10 and Italy a 8/10.I had higher expectations for a 4* Ramada hotel and would not stay at a Ramada again. ","April 10, 2018","11    Ramada Plaza by Wyndham Milano

Later on talking with my colleugues I found out that the hotel has it's own car (and I saw it by myself parked next to the hotel) with a very gentel driver and that my colleagues paid only 40,00euro for the trasfer, instead I paid 60,00 for the unpleasant trip by city taxi.

634,"Two families, each family with two interconnecting rooms. Checked in late around 11pm. Although emailed hotel in advance and had their unique reference with notes on system, the checking was painfully long and complicated. The staff couldn’t read or understand the prepaid hotel voucher and insisted we only had two rooms and not four. After checking the prepaid hotel voucher with another colleague or manager, he finally confirmed booking is for four room. No bell boy but directed to the lifts to our rooms. One lift out of two in operation. The lift is small so had to use twice. Got to rooms, comfy and clean but had to call reception for them to unlock the interconnecting rooms which took over 20 minuets to arrive.Next morning after good nights sleep heading to restaurant for breakfast, the only one operating lift was so busy we walked down two flights of stairs. Breakfast was very basic and limited.Bathroom clean with large walk-in shower. Mini fridge wasn’t cold. Tea coffee making facility maybe isn’t used much or not replenished because was dusty and tea bag, sugar and milk missing or enough for one cup.Outdoor pool was the main reason for staying at this hotel as there were better and cheaper hotels more central but without a pool. Big letdown, more like a large domestic pool but children still enjoyed.Shuttle “bus” service to town centre limited operational times, morning only and just one way plus max 6 people. Short walk to subway, about 10 minuets walk. Supermarket nearby but no late opening. Very nice restaurant nearby for lunch or dinner.

The hotel looked a bit dated from outside and I was a bit sceptical whilst walking towards the hotel. The hotel was great from the inside though. The check-in process was quick and the rooms were spacious. The staff was helpful in directing us towards the places we wanted to visit during our short trip.

642,"We stayed here as part of the Grand Prix package and had no real complaints. Arrived on the Friday and check in quick and easy. Room was lovely and clean with a big balcony, but no chairs on the balcony to sit out. Ate at the Brassiere twice, food excellent, drinks in the bar a little expensive. Supermarket opposite handy and a small restaurant, which we ate at twice and was good and more reasonably priced, but only one girl serving so a bit slow. Extended our stay by an extra day and went into Milan - 6-7 minute walk to the Metro - 8 stops to the centre €1.50 each on way. Only real complaint was the English tea! Plenty for the weekend in the restaurant and room, but ran out Sunday night.","September 8, 2017","11    Ramada Plaza by Wyndham Milano

650,"I stayed here with a friend who was on a business trip, was pleasantly surprised with the hotel. Some of the photos on the website made it look quite tacky, but actually it’s pretty fun. The design is bright and colourful, lots of unusual lighting and quirky features. Check-in was quick and easy, with friendly staff. Car park is only small but if you can get a space it’s free of charge to use. There is on-street parking available but this is payable (€2 an hour if I remember rightly). Rooms are quite small, but have everything you need. They feel as if they have been made to look fairly good but on a low budget, nothing is particularly luxurious but does look nice. Beds are typical of European hotels. The wardrobe is a rail/shelves behind a sheer curtain, unusual but does the job. Bathroom is large, really decent sized bath and powerful shower. The bathroom door doubles as the toilet door, swings 90 degrees, which is slightly odd. It’s also a glass door that doesn’t really sit in any sort of frame so just kind of hangs there. Nicely stocked minibar. View was interior so nothing much to speak of. Bar was fun and the staff there are really very good. I spent a bit of time there alone just doing bits of work, they couldn’t have looked after me better. Attentive, chatty, skilled and they offered complimentary bar snacks which was a nice touch. A short walk from the hotel is a tram stop which takes you into the city centre, I walked one-way which was around 45 mins to the Cathedral and Piazza. ","May 22, 2019","12    nhow Milano

665,"Located in the rejuvenated via Tortona / porta Genova district, once the heart of Milano Industrial district, this hotel is all about lifestyle rather than tourist spot.Located inside a former factory, red bricks and steel beams from the 19th century are the main corridors construction materials.Rooms are minimalist in their designs, but equipped with an espresso machine.Reception area is outstanding, and will set you in the mood of your stay, with art pieces exhibited around, and a tray where while waiting for check in you can get munchies and mineral waters of many kinds. I was unfortunately set in a quiet room dotted with a mattress that well reached it's retirement age, and could feel the springs in some parts of the bed. Quiet inappropriate when you pay 180 euros a night. After changing room, comfort was more in relation with the venue quality.Reception personnal is extremely courteous and professional. And the venue has about 20 parking spot free of charge.My room was about 20 sqm, and I enjoyed greatly its neat and minimalist design. Bathroom (and possibly the rooms too) need to be quickly refreshed beside my 1st night mattress disaster, shower joints are blacken from mold.Hotel location is top if you want to experience the Navigli district nightlife, restaurants and cafe abound nearby. For the runners, hotel is located next to one of the Navigli and you can run for miles along the water on a semi pedestrian way with almost no cars.Excellent hotel, but rooms would certainly deserve to be refreshed, at a 180euros per night this is the least to expect.Internet worked well and my rooms all have an espresso machine.

680,"Loved the quirkiness of this hotel....lots of very strange works of art and sharks head bins! The decor was interesting to say the least! I have to agree with a previous comment that you do feel like you're walking into an underground carpark ( not a particularly welcoming front entrance) and we found it rather difficult to find if walking from the Pta Genova underground station - top tip: come out of the Via Tortona exit, walk straight ahead of you across the little square with taxis and tram stops and take the little road to the very far left and there is a cutting across the railway tracks that has replaced the green bridge which is blocked off. We didn't realise this and walked all the way round. Once on Via Tortona it is still a bit off a walk and its location, I would say, is the only reason I haven't given it 5 stars. However there are lots of very traditional and very Italian bistros and osterias in this area and most of the time we were the only tourists in them....BelleDonne Bistrot/Osteria and Boccino were particularly good and Boccino has a lovely roof terrace. Getting back to the hotel, there was a fantastic section for breakfast and the option to have eggs cooked how you liked. There was even prosecco for those who want bubbles for breakfast. What we really loved was the little paper bags that you could actually take a croissant or muffin out with you for lunch! Lovely touch! However we were always so full after our breakfast that we never wanted much for lunch! Given that breakfast was so varied and good we were a bit surprised that the restaurant had such an uninviting menu....we had wanted to try it out but on investigation we decided to go to the local restaurants instead. Our room (249) didn't have the best of views out onto the carpark but it was huge with a massive bed, lovely powerful shower and nice toiletries. They could do with a few hooks in the bathroom but there was plenty of space for toilet bags. Although we personally found the bed a little soft and bouncy we definitely slept well and there was no other noise from the corridor/other rooms or outside even with the window open. I would highly recommend if you don't mind a walk!","July 18, 2018","12    nhow Milano

681,"We‘ve booked the hotel just spontaneously for one night. We knew already the hotel from last year and also last year was it great. This time it was even better! The hotel is situated in a modern part of Milano with lots of art buildings and restaurants where the locals go, the center is just 15 minutes with the tram to the Dome and Galleria in Milano ( you have to walk 10min. from the hotel to the tram station). If you want to experience not just touristic mashup of restaurants, then the Hotel is perfect! The Via Tortona is filled with beautiful new and modern restaurant with a lot of varieties of cousine. The hotel itselft is a design hotel. From the entrance, to the reception, breakfast room and the hall to the rooms-everything is done with details to art! And they change the exhibitions regularly.Big thanks to Jenny and the whole Team! We feel like home in this hotel, everybody is friendly and helpful, they‘ve recommended us some restaurant, booked for us the restaurants, planned our trip and made the stay unforgettable. We have got a big suite with a bathtub, shower, double bed. An upgrade from the hotel to make their guests happy. Thank you very much again! As we have arrived in the morning, they have already cleaned and prepared our room and gave us complimentary breakfast so we can get some power for the day! Again a big thanks to Jenny and the staff who has organized this for us! We will definitely recommend this hotel to everybody who wants to visit Milano! Everything was perfect and the service is one of the best that I have experienced until now. I will definitely come back here!!! Thank you again!","July 15, 2018","12    nhow Milano

The rooms are big and pleasant. The bathroom is huge -almost suite like - even for a standard-type of room. Very clean, nicely taken care of, with details that only picky eyes catch. Design and ambiance are not only trendy but also restful. The atmosphere is cosy even in the hotel hallways and ways to the rooms. Breakfast buffet is gorgeous, almost as good as in the best 5-stars US hotels. Front desk is very professional and attentive. This is the place to stay, whether you’re working like a dog all day (like me this time) or shopping like crazy for a few days, or just enjoying the special and pleasant atmosphere of this North-Italian city.

686,Stayed at this hotel for a Milan city break. The hotel is near the very pretty and picturesque Navigli canals and waterways with a wealth of good quality and reasonably priced restaurants and bars but yet a short ride to the main city centre of Milan if you wish. We would recommend taking the Metro from the station P.ta Genova which is close by and only a few stops and a few Euros. The Milan Metro system is very easy to use and find your way around. A special thanks to Jenny Rossi in guest relations and the team at nhow Milan as nothing was too much trouble for them to make our stay as comfortable as possible. The hotel is spotlessly clean and beautifully designed as only the Italians know how! To take an industrial building and create such a masterpiece of an hotel with great unique design features is nothing short of a miracle. We enjoyed every minute staying there and would like to thank all the staff that looked after us. Would certainly consider going back.,"June 7, 2018","12    nhow Milano

Looking at the photos and reviews of Nhow Hotel, I decided to book our stay there and I was so glad I did.Before arrival I emailed the hotel and advised I was surprising my partner for his birthday and asked if they could recommend places to eat and party that weekend. Jenny Rossi from the hotel emailed me back and straight away said she would upgrade our room and give us VIP treatment during our stay. Jenny did as promised and gave us a few options of places to go and eat.On arrival as soon as we handed in our passports at reception they called Jenny to come and see to us. Jenny greeted us and as promised upgraded our room. Jenny organised for us to have a complimentary drink at the bar and for booked us in for breakfast in their restaurant the following morning at no charge. We went out for the rest of the day, when we arrived back to our room, Jenny had left a bottle of prosecco with a platter of fruit in our room with a lovely note. What can I say Jenny really just made our stay extra special! The hotel is quirky and modern. I love the whole atmosphere of the hotel. Our room was fab, which had an amazing big jacuzzi bath in the middle of the room which is great for couples. The restaurant is beautiful and the breakfast is amazing. The location is fabulous. It is in walking distance to the Navigli area which has a canal surrounded by restaurants and bars, and is quite picturesque in the sun.To central Milan it takes about 15 mins on the tram and the tram is only about 10 mins walk from the hotel. We also travelled to Lake Como for the day and you can easily get the metro to the train station. The metro is also about 10 mins walk away. When we go back to Milan I would 100% stay at Nhow again.

I suggest an Aperol spritz if you are not familiar with the cocktail. Breakfast is served downstairs at a separate restaurant and the morning selection is wonderful. There is an omelette station and a juicer, where the staff cut the fruits and prepare your juice on the spot. The restaurant has a huge selection of meats and cheeses along with breads and fruits.While the hotel is not located in the city center, where the top attractions are located, the hotel provides a free shuttle in a Maserati!

Travelocity said the hotel’s policy was “no refunds” but since it was within 24 hours of booking, she thought it would be a reasonable request and would call the hotel. She did and was told they would refund the $750. Travelocity requested an email confirmation which the hotel said they would provide. A day later, Travelocity had not heard from the hotel, called back, and was told there would be no refund.

711,"This hotel is truly an example of how clean and well constructed a hotel should be. Amazing room, we stayed at a junior suite and it was totally worth it. The breakfast buffet was worth including in our room. Great spa and staff as well. Our only issues were with the room air conditioner and room service (staff) and the quality of the food. For some reason even if we changed the temperature to 69-70 degrees it would always stay at 75 or above and it took hours to get the room to cool down. We let the staff know, but they could not figure it out either; their only solution was to close the bathroom door, which oddly enough helped cool the room down a bit. We think they control the A/C from somewhere else and they just don’t want their guess messing with the temperatures, perhaps to save energy?! In-room dining, for the price they charge, needs a true revamp! The staff taking the orders should speak and understand English because a few times they had a hard time understanding us and got our orders wrong; plus they don’t speak clearly, they rushed me off the phone and at times it felt like they were screaming at me; it was obvious they were frustrated that we didn’t speak Italian or they didn’t speak English, either way it was very frustrating to order in. Mariana was kind and was the only one that understood us and took care of us one night, but overall the food arrived cold and not fresh. Their in-room dining experience is not a good representation of the high luxury standards the hotel perceives. Overall, we loved the hotel, the location is ideal and we will surely stay there again. Let’s just hope when we do, the few issues we encountered are resolved. ","June 3, 2019","13    Excelsior Hotel Gallia, a Luxury Collection Ho...

When we arrived, the first thing we noticed was the most beautiful scent of flowers.. the second thing was the enthusiasm and professionalism of all the staff. We were checked in by a wonderful receptionist, Beatrice , who then escorted us to our suite, which she had upgraded to a bigger one for our anniversary. The furnishings, bed linen, coffee machine etc were all of a high quality and a huge bed that was so comfortable. Nothing was too much trouble and Beatrice was clearly proud to represent the hotel. Unfortunately on our first night, there was a slight problem with the air conditioning, but when we mentioned it the next morning, we were instantly taken care of and given a change of suite without question , and upgraded, yet again to an even nicer suite overlooking the front with view of the Grand Central station. When we came back from sightseeing , she had organised a bottle of bubbly on ice and an anniversary cake as a surprise left in our room. The rooftop bar was a great place to relax in the evening with drinks and nibbles, and again, the staff there were friendly and attentive. On our second day we were greeted by name and this attention to detail and warm welcome was present throughout our stay from everyone . The breakfast at the Excelsior is amazing - everything to a high standard and beautifully presented. Special thanks and mention to our lovely waitress Susannah. It’s fair to say that this is quite a pricey hotel, but in terms of value for money, it is unbeatable . The complimentary chauffeur driven Maserati facility was a great service - thank you to our driver Sergio for taking us into the city centre and for passing on his local knowledge! All the staff make this the wonderful hotel that it is, and we really did not want to leave! Milan is a wonderful city, but our stay at the hotel genuinely made our trip extra special! ❤️","May 29, 2019","13    Excelsior Hotel Gallia, a Luxury Collection Ho...

714,"We were so pleasantly surprised by this hotel! We typically stay at the Park Hyatt but it was booked and this place was even nicer! It is renovated to perfection. Our suite was beautiful. Modern and thoughtful. The breakfast is amazing. Anything you want is there, including a juice machine with fresh veggies and fruits for you to make your own juice. They will make anything you want if you do not see what you want there. They have a lovely cafe for afternoon coffee. The location is good and bad. It is right across from the train station, so if you are doing day trips it is so convenient. I expected to hear noise, but did not hear anything. The neighborhood is not great shopping or dining so you either can take a taxi, walk or their Masarati can take you places. We did all 3 options and were great. Plus loved taking a train and then just being back at the hotel. Wonderful new option in Milan!","May 29, 2019","13    Excelsior Hotel Gallia, a Luxury Collection Ho...

715,"Had a great stay at this hotel, we picked it due to the location as it is a short walk from Milan Centrale station, after a Frecciarosa ride from Venice. It is about 5 mins walk once you know which direction. Check in was straightforward. Room is clean and well appointed modern luxury manner. Shower is strong and you have the choice of normal shower head or rainforest type. We appreciate the complimentary water in the room, which also gets topped up during night turndown service. A number of highlights: complimentary transport to/from Duomo or Via Monte Napoleone (driver Guido gets a special mention for entertaining us), and breakfast (Daniel who kindly help us with the juice machine every morning). Highly recommended.","May 25, 2019","13    Excelsior Hotel Gallia, a Luxury Collection Ho...

It is a historic facade surrounding some of the most remarkable, cool, Italian, ""designer"" features I have seen. There are leather panels and sleek marble - great technology. We really thought the hotel exuded a fashionable Milan ""vibe.""The shuttle is quite impressive - two Maserati cars to transport you around town. The spa is absolutely outstanding. A really nice rooftop bar and gym.But most importantly, the staff bent over backwards to accommodate us. I must really thank the Concierge staff - we asked them to work miracles to get us tickets to see the Last Supper, which is sold out for months - and they did.

722,"The hotel is impressive when you first arrive and staff were friendly and efficient allocating our room. Lifts are small but we used the main staircase to our room on the fourth floor. We had a very nice view of the station which is a magnificent building.Room was a reasonable size but not really enough workspace for a business trip. Reasonable wardrobe and drawer space. There was a large shower and bath and plenty of storage space in the bathroom. Large and comfortable bed with good sockets beside each side, including USB, one European and one UK. Always useful these days and often lacking. More sockets over the small desk area.We were disappointed when coffee and glasses that had been used were not replenished. One day a cleaning cloth was left on a chair, so housekeeping need to make more checks.Breakfast was included and the buffet was OK but nothing special. No toaster for example. Coffee (decaf) was awful!We did like the Terrace bar however which had nice nibbles with you drinks. The fitness centre is quite hard to find. It's located above the Spa and you need to take a separate lift to it. It has reasonable Technogym equipment but not a huge range. The room was also incredibly hot and it didn't help that not all the running machines had working fans.If you want to go to the main area of Milan, Duomo, La Scala etc the hotel offer a car, but I found the walk approx 30 minutes easy to although you do have to watch out for trams and trolley buses.","April 7, 2019","13    Excelsior Hotel Gallia, a Luxury Collection Ho...

723,"Let’s get the negatives out of the way first. A lot of the guests here are pretentious and unbelievably obnoxious. I watched on many occasion’s guests thinking that just because they had a few designer clothes on, they could treat the staff as their own personal servants without a mention of a please or thank you. Secondly, breakfast is completely overpriced. We had a few items from the buffet and an omelette and for 2 people this came to 80 euros. Do yourself a favour and head down the road to eat. To the positives. The staff here are good and I especially liked the concierge team outside who gave us a lovely warm welcome on our arrival. The bedroom was great as well with a big comfortable bed The gym is really well put together with some excellent equipment. All in all, whilst I liked this hotel I couldn’t stand being surrounded my people with no manners which I found pretty appalling. I do however accept this is not the fault of the hotel.

The reception was wonderful after a long flight they selected the best room for us and we were shown to our room that was perfect. Windows open widely so fresh air was gorgeous. The breakfast was delicious and wide variety. They brought us pancakes and they did fresh carrot juice that was very special. The concierge offered the Maserati to drive us to city center every morning which was very special. We were tired so had room service in hotel every night! It was the best lasagne and tiramisu we have ever had. Well done! Location is great, with train station across the road. We did loads of shopping in the station terminal and we went to Venice one day with the fast train. This hotel is perfect in every way.

725,"Stayed 3 nights in early March. Overall I had a great business stay at the hotel. This is a well-run, stylish luxury hotel with a polished and professional staff. I would be more than happy to return for another business or vacation stay.Specific comments below:Location: The hotel is located right next to the main train station. This makes it very convenient for a business traveler. I easily took trains to Zurich and central Italy in the morning and returned to the hotel in the evening. There are express trains to Malpensa Airport and the bus from Linarte at the main station. There are several subway lines at the station as well which makes it easy to get anywhere in Milan. If you want to stay near the main tourist sites this hotel is not as well located as others, but its just a few subway stops to the center of Milan.Room: I am am a Marriott elite (Ambassador) and was upgraded to a Atelier Suite four days before check-in after applying 3 Suite Night Awards. The Atelier Suite was a fantastic room. Very stylish, showed very little wear and tear and had a full complement of amenities including a mini-bar, coffee/tea maker, etc. If felt a lot larger than its stated square footage due to very efficient use of space. The suite has a solid door between the bedroom and the living room, a separate entrance area and a changing area as well as a large bathroom. The bathroom had a bath and a great rain shower (with a high tech steam shower appliance as well). The room was quiet despite looking out over the square in front of the train station and the blackout curtains in the room worked very well making it easy to get a good nights sleep. This was more than enough space for a solo business traveler and an ideal amount of space for a couple.Service: Everyone I interacted with at the hotel was pleasant, professional and polished. The breakfast staff were particularly nice. Everyone spoke excellent english.Marriott Elite Benefits: There is no lounge, but this hotel offers Marriott Platinum and above elites a free buffet breakfast each morning and the breakfast is excellent with a wide range of high quality breakfast items as well as made to order eggs. I also received a nice welcome note along with a gift of chocolates in my room.","March 27, 2019","13    Excelsior Hotel Gallia, a Luxury Collection Ho...

726,"A luxury stay in the newly renovated hotel is next to the central train station - extremely convenient. Still, visiting with our 4 year old daughter, we would prefer the center to be on walking distance. In this case, the Mazerati shuttle was an amazing convenience for us. I would definately recommend to be able to pre-book it, not to feel insecure. Staff is very professional. I would like to thank Marta - Front Office for her positive attitude and willingness to assist us during our stay, as well as Hankong - Breakfast service for recommending different bread flavors and offering to serve it hot for us, both of them with a big smile.

We have to say that everyone in this hotel, from the General Manager, Marco Olivieri to the complete staff made us feel welcome and at home during the whole stay. They would bring little details to our room everyday, chocolates, cookies ad plenty of water. The room was always perfectly clean with two services each day. Breakfast was a feast every morning, all included in the cost of the room. On the days we came back real tired Room service would be served in less than 25 minutes by a buttler. Last night the Manager sent an exquisite bottle of wine and cheese. Thanks so much, Mr. Olivieri. You have a 5 star staff including yourself!

I notified the hotel the next morning but on our return it still hadn't been fixed - normally I would automatically rate the Hotel down for not fixing it. However, they upgraded us to an amazing room over looking the square and about double the size of our first room, at this point I thought this is what they should have done.

746,"Spent 4 days in Milan recently and stayed at the Excelsior. We could not have loved a hotel more. The staff from every corner of the hotel were exceptional - they presented with a friendly smile and went out of their way to assist us. The room was comfortable and elegant, with every amenity. Breakfast was a delight, nothing short of that! The location of the hotel is so convenient. I would highly recommend this hotel for anyone spending time in Milan.

747,"Wow! I am beyond happy I found this hotel in Milan. I hosted a three day retreat for my clients in their Montenapoleon room and also stayed there for 5 days and it was truly a glittering reflection of Milan. My room was on the top floor and ultra modern and beautiful with great amenities. The entire property is beautiful, modern and very well kept. The service is amazing and efficient. There are no irons in the rooms but housekeeping does a stellar job ironing two pieces a day free. The restaurants are also great with breakfast and apertivo in the evenings. I also loved that they have the house car, a Maserati which takes you to the center of the city and picks you up. Plus great perks with partner stores. The concierge go above and beyond and overall, this hotel was a great experience. My event was a success and everything was top of the line. My clients were impressed and that made me totally thrilled. I highly recommend you book this hotel now because the price is worth it!!! It's in a great location in Milan and close to the Duomo area.","November 3, 2018","13    Excelsior Hotel Gallia, a Luxury Collection Ho...

748,"I have been staying at Gallia since 2007, the hotel went through a major refurbishment and yet again it came out on top as one of the finest and best hotels of Milan. Professionalism, excellence of service, fine dining, caring stuff and above all: awesome bedrooms. You can’t say you’ve been in Milan if you haven’t slept here. From the hotel director to the bartender, everyone really cares for all the guests and as the original motto of Starwood used to say: you belong! Will never stop recommending this hotel to anyone and everyone. Must try: the bar’s terrace, the wine cellar and obviously the brand new spa!","November 1, 2018","13    Excelsior Hotel Gallia, a Luxury Collection Ho...

750,My husband and I spent one night in Milan and chose this beautifully rennovated hotel. We were so pleased with everything about it especially the rooftop bar and restaurant where we enjoyed a gorgeous sunset and beautiful views of the central train station and square. Very good location and the hotels car can take you anywhere within reason!! We chose the popular shopping street.

751,"The luxury is felt everywhere in this hotel (except for the bathroom amenities, which could have been up-scaled, and the quality/variety of coffee options for the in-room coffee machine).Breakfast was the best I ever had, and even the room-service food was extremely good.Room was perfectly dark, with no light entering in the morning, and also perfectly quiet, with no sound coming in from the street.My two minor issues were - (a) the radio did not work; and (b) on check-in the room was not available, and the receptionist took my phone number to inform me once the room is available, but I received no such call.","October 16, 2018","13    Excelsior Hotel Gallia, a Luxury Collection Ho...

753,"We spent 4 nights at Hotel Excelsior Gallia, and it was very impressive! Actually we visited the property quite long ago before its renovation, so this is our second time, to celebrate our anniversary. The location of the property is great, very convenient by walk (and next to the metro), and close to almost all major spots. We took the complimentary Maserati for a couple times, both drivers were very friendly and polite!The Concierge team of the hotel was expecially helpful, ie we were successfully booked at Michelin starred Seta and Vun, as well as Nobu with short notice. The Suite we got was also fantastic, with an excellent view, and the housekeeping lady was really nice and responsive (as I bumped into her once during the day)During the stay, I received a couple personal notes from Marco, the GM who welcomes us with warmest hospitality!! The experience overall was fatanstic, and I highly recommend this property to couples or families who would like to spend a relaxing yet fulfilling vacation in Milan!Sophia","October 10, 2018","13    Excelsior Hotel Gallia, a Luxury Collection Ho...

754,"I stayed a the hotel between Oct. 1-4, 2018. This was my first stay at the hotel although my family stayed here last year. Milan was our last stop in our 12 day Northern Italian trip that started from Turin and covered most of Piedmont and Lombardy regions. We stayed at highly rated hotels that were 3 times more expensive than this hotel but I was most pleased by the facility of Excelsior Gallia and the most impressed by their quality service that was present from the time we stepped into the hotel.Our room was upgraded and the view from the veranda was breathtaking. Breakfast was excellent and the pool, sauna and steam facility was probably one of the best in Italy. The restaurant was somewhat pricey but the quality of food and service was also a top notch. The location was very central and walk to the Central Train Station that can be connected to all over Milan and the rest of Italy was definitely a huge plus.We come to Milan at least annually and we will stay here again for sure.","October 3, 2018","13    Excelsior Hotel Gallia, a Luxury Collection Ho...

755,"So happy to return to the Excelsior Gallia in the Milan. We stayed here for 3 nights September 10-13. This was not our first stay (see previous review). When we found ourselves returning to Milan, the choice was easy. Unfortunately, this stay did not live up to its 5 STAR reputation. I booked an Excelsior room months in advance; I’m also a Marriott Platinum Premier Elite member. SPG and Marriott finally integrated to one system early August. My accounts were linked/merged, and my reservation showed up in my app under my Marriott Rewards #. The first indication something wasn’t right is when we checked in. While I was promptly greeted, I was not recognized for my Platinum Status, no upgrade offered, and the agent was quick to point out that breakfast was not included in the rate. I mentioned that I was a Platinum member and wanted daily breakfast as my amenity. I was told that my status was not showing on the reservation. Once he entered my number, my status was recognized and was handed a voucher to show at breakfast. He was also quick to point out that perhaps my rewards number dropped off due to the systems integration. I asked that now he had my correct status if any upgrades were available, I was told no. Not a very good customer experience.We were in room 414. A nice room, just like the excelsior room we had prior minus a small patio. There was a beautiful cake on a silver platter for our anniversary. This was a very nice gesture and greatly appreciated. Things went downhill or downstream the next morning. In less than 5 minutes in the shower, the shower water had flooded halfway through the bathroom. I was able to pop the filter off the drain and guide the water with my foot towards it, but it was backed up. The smell was terrible. It smelled like something foul was in there. I quickly finished and grabbed every towel – all beyond saturated with water. I quickly called to report the problem and ask for more towels. Maintenance came and said they needed to pour some acid down the drain and that would take care of it. The smell was overpowering, but we elected to have him do it in hopes my husband could shower. After waiting 20 plus minutes, my husband went in the shower. Same thing. It was not fixed.Prior to leaving for our day, we spoke to Chiara (sorry for misspelling) at the front desk to report the issue. She was very apologetic and professional. She told us she would get on it right away and give us an update later in the day. Later that afternoon, Chiara called and said they are not able to fix it, and the room was not operable. She said she had the Signature Suite available for us when we returned for our last 2 nights.Chiara walked us up to personally check us in the room.The Signature Suite located on the 5th floor is beautiful. Living room, sitting chairs, separate bedroom, his and her closets, makeup area separate from bathroom, one large bathroom and a smaller one in the hallway. Two separate Patios – one off the bedroom, one off the living room. The first night, I decided to have a bath. The first 10-15 seconds of turning on the faucet, the water was a light brown/rust color. The bathroom also has a musty smell. Our last night, I was awakened by a loud noise that came from the bathroom. In the morning, I was greeted by a puddle of dirty water on the floor and the vent from the Ceiling was on the floor. It had fallen from the wall with a surge of water. We couldn’t believe it. 2 rooms, similar experiences.Facilities were great as last time. This is why we returned. I would also like to recognize Marcello in the breakfast room. We enjoyed seeing him again on this visit. He is a true professional and all about the customer experience. Sorry Excelsior, Love the property, but this was not a good customer experience. In fact – I never heard from any member from management regarding the issues and the inconveniences we experienced. How could a guest be checked into a room where the bathroom was inoperable? Surely this was not a new issue, with a backup this severe, there had to have been some prior reports. We do look forward to a future stay and hopefully more of a 5 Star experience.","September 28, 2018","13    Excelsior Hotel Gallia, a Luxury Collection Ho...

756,"While this hotel is not centrally located, it is on a bus line and not terribly far from the Mico convention centre. Truly however, what stands out is that the rooms and bathrooms are very large - especially by European standards, well-appointed and very clean. The staff was amazing and helpful at every turn. They booked tours, printed copies and went out of their way. The hotel also had lots of nice touches like snacks at all hours and a variety of ammenities.Highly recommended for the business traveler.","June 23, 2019","14    Milan Suite Hotel

757,"Me, my mother and sister decided to go to Milan for a short break. After looking at a number of outrageously priced hotels for a 2 night stay, we settled on Milan Suite Hotel. We arrived late and as there is no restaurant on the premises, we decided to Deliveroo some dinner to the hotel. The rooms are big in size, clean and well equipped. Although located just outside of Milan, getting into the centre is not a problem and the lady on reception helped us to sort out a 24 hour ticket which was able to be used on all transport throughout Milan centre (you can purchase this at the front desk and is definitely worth purchasing). Be aware that these buses can be very busy during peak periods. We opted for the breakfast included option, which was lovely. I would definitely recommend as it is great value for money. There is a lot of selection from smoked salmon to a pancake making machine!","June 11, 2019","14    Milan Suite Hotel

758,"This hotel was a second choice (not in preferred location), due to the first choice being fully booked. However, it was a blessing in disguise. As this hotel was a similar price, but the room was far larger and very well presented. Staff were very helpful and dressed smart. Breakfast was OK, food was good. But, the seating could be more comfortable and I was sat in a high traffic area, which wasn’t so good. Overall the experience I had for the one night I stayed was pleasant and the next time I am in Milan, I will book this hotel again. I will just make sure I chose a better table for breakfast.

There are bar snacks,sweets and soft drinks available in the reception/bar area all day. The breakfast selection is quite amazing.The location is lovely and quiet and although around 25 minutes into the centre (on public transport) there is a bus service running every 5 minutes during the day - even over the entire Easter holiday - and also trams.As you can probably guess we had a marvellous time.","April 24, 2019","14    Milan Suite Hotel

762,"As other reviewers have noted the hotel is very modern, the rooms are very spacious, the staff very friendly and helpful and the breakfast buffet has an incredible variety of food. All very positive. One thing to be aware of is that the hotel is a fair way from the city centre. It is also 20 minutes walk from the train station which links to the airport. This is a business neighbourhood which means not many people around at nighttime. It was strongly suggested to me by a local that when I arrived late at night I should get off at the next station and pay for a taxi from there to hotel as there would be no taxis at the Bovisa station and it would be very unsafe to walk. I did get off at Bovisa but he was correct there were no taxis. The hotel is quite hard to find from the station and so I would not have wanted to walk even if it appeared safe. I ended up ringing the hotel and getting the number of a local taxi company so I could order a taxi. I would strongly recommend that if you are arriving at night contacting the hotel in advance to get the taxi details. There is a smaller station about 10 minutes walk from the hotel to get into the city or there is a bus from across from the hotel which will take you a few train stops away from the Duomo. Another thing to keep in mind is that while it is a developing area there currently is very little in the way of restaurants etc close to the hotel (I saw 2). Given all of the other positives I would recommend it for a stay of a few nights but any longer and I’d suggest staying closer to the centre. ","April 20, 2019","14    Milan Suite Hotel

763,We stayed here last week for one night on route from lake Como to Copenhagen. It took a while to find the hotel from the local station but it was worth it as the girls who checked us in offered water and calmness. As it was cold and wet we ate at the nearby Raddisson hotel which was very good. The Milan suite room was big and had the best bathroom I’ve seen in a long time. Room was quiet and comfortable with a great bed and sitting area. Breakfast was good but the best part of this hotel was the service and care of the girls on the desk. I’d recommend it as an alternative to the expensive hotels in the city. ,"April 11, 2019","14    Milan Suite Hotel

773,"Just spent a week here for my birthday and the hotel is beautiful!!! I don't think I have ever stayed in a hotel where the rooms are that large. Everything was spacious, modern and so comforting. Bathroom had both a shower and separate tub that was perfect! The junior suite we had on the 2nd floor also included a patio that is the cutest thing for coffee in the morning. Yes there's a coffee pot and a huge selection of flavors to choose from. Bed was like heaven after long days of exploring Italy and housekeeping was like a dream. We left money and expensive things out everyday, not one thing taken. We actually came back to our valuables stacked neatly!! As many pros as there are to love about this property the one thing that I can say that needs improvement is the breakfast selection. It was pretty bland and even though it was included in our room rate, some mornings we didn't bother to go down. That and the hotel being a bit away from the main heart of the city (bus stop right in front of hotel though!) would be my only complaints.

781,"An amazing hotel with wonderful staff, rooms and facilities!The hotel provides complimentary wireless internet hotspots that you can utilize whilst roaming around Milan.Although not in the city center, 20 euro will get you to about anywhere you want to go in a taxi & if you’re adventurous the bus costs 4 euro and you’ll be there in 25 minutes.Although the hotel doesn’t have a restaraunt dinner facilities (it does but the food is kept frozen) they advised us of the Radison Blu around the corner that had a beautiful dinner. And within 5 minutes walk is a supermarket for snacks and water and everything else you need.The rooms are spacious and modern, and a special mention to Irene who helped us on our trip she was very polite & helpful before we got to the hotel and even more so once we arrived.We will be back again — Grazie!","June 6, 2018","14    Milan Suite Hotel

782,"We stayed one night at the Milan Suites Hotel in April 2018. It is a sensational hotel, well located on a bus route to Milan city center and at an affordable price. We enjoyed our stay very much. Friendly helpful staff, very nice breakfast. We would return to this hotel and would recommend it to anyone wanting a clean, luxurious and affordable hotel within easy reach to Milan’s city center.","May 11, 2018","14    Milan Suite Hotel

I have celiac diesease and require gluten free food. They offered gluten free options at breakfast, lunch and dinner. Opt for the breakfast in the morning, it was quite generous with its portions. The rooms were beautiful, comfortable and spacious. The separate shower and bathtub was a nice touch too.  We went to the AC Milan futbol game, the hotel is only about a 15 minute taxi ride there and we took an Uber back. All around perfect hotel and great value!","May 6, 2018","14    Milan Suite Hotel

784,"Superb... from the welcome we received when stepping into the reception for the first time to the sincere send off when we eventually had to leave.The staff are excellent, helpful, sincere and friendly and provided brilliant advice. Our room was extremely well equipped, spacious and luxurious. Whilst we didn't eat here the breakfast looked to have an extensive choice of foods.The best touch was reserved for my wife who was having her birthday during our stay. We had some special items sent up to our room on the day and that was only on the back of a chance remark I had made the night before about it. Having stayed in many hotels around the.world over the years this.goes straight into the top 3, it's that good. Oh, and if you are concerned about where it is in relation to the centre of Milan, that should be seen as a good thing as you are really getting value for money and the travel connections of bus, tram or train mean you are really only 20 to 25 minutes away from Via Dante (for the Duomo) or the castle and travel is so cheap too it makes little difference, at least it didn't for us.","April 9, 2018","14    Milan Suite Hotel

789,"My choice of hotel for staying in Milano for 8 days was a really good one I using very long time everytime for where to stay but this time I was taking into me what other guest have saying on trip advisor and other internet pages.I had a kind of contact with hotel before travelling and they was so professional that I after the first mail contact in the answering understood I have done a good deal.They answer all question I had so it was easier for me to know things around my holiday. No question was stupid.Hotel is located not in the center of town but its not so bad. From the most popular tourist things then You most expect around 30 minutes every way with bus 57. Then I speak about centrum of town if I can call it that. You can also stop before in the way to town at metro station Domodossola/Gerussalem. And then take metro in that direction You want. Its 5 metro lines in the town. Or You can of course take taxi i didnt do that I heard price was then around 20-25 euro.When I come to Milano from Malpensa I took train to Bovisa Nord station. Its took around 35 minutes and have the cost 13 euro. Then You can take taxi to hotel this 1,6 km or walk if You have good memory for streets that i did. Walked to the hotel and when I went home I took taxi.That was about transport system.This should be about the hotel.The people in reception is so nice some of the nicest people I ever have meeting under my travels so far 27 country. Nothing is a problem for them to answer and fix.Room was nice and very big after my meaning. It was around 45 kvadrat. The bathroom is big and had seperated shower and bath tub. Leaving room had very big television with many tv channels I only looked at some sports channel some few days.Shower and bath tub is lovely.Its 2 table with chair on both if You are there and want to work on computer.Its sitting group with sofa and 2 chairs and table for relaxing.You can make yourself tea or coffee there was different types of both.My room had a micro wave.The Wi-fi was super fast all 8 days all over the hotel area.There are breakfast possibilities at hotel I didnt eat that but seeing it when I passed out every day its look good. I eating a late dinner there they have some few chooses for small dinners.Hotel are selling transport tickets for 1,5 hour and 24 hours. Then You can use metro-bus and train in the center sone.You can hear the traffic if You are sensitiv for noise but it didnt affect my stay there I had something in my ears.Mini bar have different to drink but not much alcohol that not was a problem for me.Like You have understood I write a lot and before its too long I will stop there.I recommend this hotel from all parts of my heart.","December 2, 2017","14    Milan Suite Hotel

790,"This hotel didn't look much from the outside and kind of seems in the middle of no where but it is actually a hidden gem. In terms of location, there is a bus stop right outside the hotel that will take you into the city centre in about 25 minutes - so not too bad! The hotel had a luxury feel to it, even though the price was not particularly expensive (in comparison to the rest of Milan). The room and bathroom were huge with big comfy bed, separate bath and walk in shower. There is a list of amenities in the bathroom from toothbrushes to razors that you can ask for (all complimentary) and there is a lovely selection of toiletries in the room. It was my birthday whilst I stayed there and the cleaners, noticing my cards up on the desk, left a bottle of red wine and a packet of milanese risotto in the room for our return - an excellent touch! Overall an amazing hotel, would definitely stay here again if I visited Milan.","November 21, 2017","14    Milan Suite Hotel

Also about 10min walk from the train station with easy links to the Central Station (one change at Garibaldi). The tickets were available to buy at the reception.

796,"When we were booking we had a hard time finding a good value in a good hotel in Milan -- clearly the season was still busy even at the end of September. We were not sure about this place as it seemed to be in a strange area, away from the center of the city. Well, it IS in a strange area -- a bit ugly and sterile, but it didn't seem unsafe. A few other hotels are in the area, too. The street did not look promising to find nice restaurants either (with only cheap pizza joints and asian takeaways nearby). But the excellent front desk informed us of two outstanding places within walking distance -- although both fill up, so make reservations.The location isn't on any useful subway or tram/trolly line, either. The only option is a somewhat slow bus that takes half an hour to get to the Duomo.As for the hotel itself -- its mostly great news. Our junior suite was huge, the bed was nice and the bathroom alone could accommodate a refugee family of four! Front desk service was outstanding. The place is very stylish and an excellent value at this price point. Our only quibble was that €12 each for a continental breakfast seemed a bit steep.","October 9, 2017","14    Milan Suite Hotel

802,"We booked the hotel for 2 weeks as part of our anniversary. On first impression the hotel and the staff are wonderful. Check in was from 2pm onwards, however we arrived early at 12, the staff were kind enough to hold on to our bags while we explored the area. Room 1114 was large, comfortable and was generally in good condition. After spending 2 weeks in the hotel we noticed a lot of things that are in need of some maintenance. The room. The carpet in the room really needed replacing, we saw in other rooms that had been done so one can only assume that they will get around to it. The room also needed a paint, you can see a lot of marks on the walls. They had a large Samsung TV in the room, with lots of channels however not many in English. I think it was only 2. So an area for some improvement. On the plus side, we could use the mini fridge to store our drinks at no charge. We also had a balcony which was nice.Breakfast was the best bit, they have a lovely selection and service was good. They do have a 'games room', but it more like a small section on the first floor. Only problem is they only have one controller, it's not worth playing on your only! Very small number of games.Room service was below average for a hotel of this size. We ordered in room service twice and then we find out that what we ordered was just frozen food heated up. Some major improvements are needed in this area. I would recommend not getting anything from room service, just walk across the street and you can get food from the lovely restaurant at half the price and cooked fresh in front of you.Room cleaning was excellent. They were thorough and each time. Make sure you use the cards outside to indicate that the rooms need doing.Two things that really went wrong at the hotel. Both are lack of communication from the hotel. There was a power failure when a lightning bolt hit the hotel. At first no one knew what had happened, all the lights went. At that stage all doors access failed, so no one could get in to the rooms. Luckily for us we were already in the room, but for others it was a different story. Went down to reception to see what was going on and the staff were struggling to find the backup keys to all the rooms. Alot of confusion on the whole, could be handled much better if the staff were communicating better.And finally on checking out. Our flight was at 6pm, so we thought we would leave our bags at reception and then come back at 3pm when our taxi would arrive. But to our surprise the hotel said they couldn't do that as they are closing for a summer break. At no stage did the hotel inform us that they would close at 12pm on our checkout date. This left us dragging our bags around in 36 degree heat. Luckily the Radisson Blu, which is around the corner, saved us, they held on to our bags so that we could get some lunch and wait for the taxi. Pretty poor for a 5 star hotel.Overall. Decent hotel, but requires improvement. Certainly not a 4/5 star. It would be more closer to a 3.5 star. Staff need to communicate better on arrival and inform guest of any potential problems.","August 13, 2017","14    Milan Suite Hotel

The room was lovely and spacious and we are now planning on having a bathroom just like the one here! Bath was huge and really powerful shower. Bed was really comfy too!Staff friendly and welcoming and couldn't do enough to help and offer advice. As mentioned, TV channels very limited but we didn't go to Milan to watch TV so this wasn't an issue. The only reason I didn't rate it 5 stars was due to the location. The bus stop is just outside and takes around 25 minutes to central Milan which is fine. The area isn't the nicest, although we didn't encounter any problems this is the only reason why we wouldn't return. There were a couple of restaurants, takeaway places and a supermarket within 5 minutes walk thought which is handy.Thanks to Milan Suite Hotel for a lovely stay!

804,"Stayed for 2 nights. Room was great: can't say anymore. Would have been better if the tv worked properly though. Very limited channels despite advertising over 60. Reported but nothing was done. Allowed us a late check-out, which was great. However, most annoyingly, the hotel took money in advance despite emailing to say payment was due at hotel. Why was this a problem? Because I reserved (not paid) on a UK website. Even Booking.com emailed to say payment was on arrival. I have a card that doesn't cost overseas and I was going to pay in the hotel with that, not incurring fees for payment in Euros as I did. When I asked the hotel why they did this, they said it was in case of no-shows. But why did they take it 2 days before I arrived? The Chinese receptionist was very aggressive and was not listening at all when I was trying to explain what they had done. This spoiled what would have been a decent stay.

We ran into one issue at the beginning where the original arrangement we made was not honoured but it was rectified.Breakfast was the best we've had on our whole trip through Italy- with fresh squeezed juice, cut fruit, croissants and hot dishes. You could even make your own pancakes.Wifi was very strong. Asian themed decor was elegant and beautiful.

810,"Atlantic Hotel Milan. Gosh, where do I start. So I had reserved 2 Junior Suits, with the assumption that each room by default can already accommodate 2 people, so I should be able to have 4 people stay in that room per normal hotel policies. But because of an error on the booking page, I had only selected 3 adults. The reality was that we were 5 adults plus 1 baby. So we assumed just needed to pay the extra adult, because the rooms should have 4 people, and baby’s are always free.But upon check-in, the staff named Yuriy gave the worst customer service ever. We had explained about the booking error, and he was rude and tried to forced us to pay for 3 extra people (he counted the baby as an adult). After arguing back and forth, we had to pay for 2 extra adults (despite the junior suite being able to accommodate 4 adults), and the baby he claimed he would “waive”. What a crap hotel and what crap service. Never have I been more insulted in my life.The room itself is old, seems like things in the bathroom were falling apart. Location was good. Breakfast was good. But overall would not recommend this hotel to anyone. I usually don’t post reviews, but because of such crap experience I am posting one. I’ll write this review in Indonesian so another 300 million people can read it and avoid this hotel.Hotel ini bener-bener sampah guys. Jangan ada orang Indo yang mau booking di sini. Seperti yang gw jelasin di atas, gw dah booking 2 kamar, harusnya dapet 4 orang dong. Tapi karena error di booking dan Cuma tulis 3 orang, yang namanya Yuriy marah dan maksa gw bayar 3 ekstra. Kenapa situ marah-marah? Akhirnya setelah bolak balik, gw bayar 2 ekstra. Tapi sejujurnya gw ga terima. Biarpun lokasi dan sarapan okeh, menurut gw kalo percaya dengan sesama orang Indo mendingan hotel sampah ini di hindarin guys di Milan.","July 6, 2019","15    c-hotels Atlantic

817,"We booked two rooms for five people from May 30-June 2, 2019. The hotel is closer to Linate Airport than Malpensa - no surprise there. The sticker in the taxi advised that the trip would cost €50 euros but actually cost €18. It's a 5-minute walk from the central train station.Our room was modern and comfortable. We had a king bed, closets, TV, desk, safe, and windows overlooking an interior court shared by the other buildings on the block. Our bathroom was very modern, with a large vanity, sink, hair-dryer, loo, bidet, tub with a half-door (why do they do that???) and shower. Unlike most hotels we've encountered in Europe, there was no slot to turn on the power with your key-card.The elevator is microscopic - no surprise there. Three empty-handed people, max. (For newbies, all over the rest of the world, the level you walk into from the street is 0 or the ground floor, and the 1st floor is what we'd call the 2nd floor, and so on. So if you're pushing elevator buttons and nothing's happening, remember that. Your 3rd-floor room is on what would be the 4th floor in the U.S.) Breakfast is included, as usual, and is served in the breakfast room on the ground floor. It's the usual generous spread you'll find all over Europe and Asia - various breads, spreads for bread, fresh fruit, hard-boiled eggs, pastries, occasionally cookies, cereals hot and cold, add-ins for cereals, yogurt, cheeses, deli meat. All fresh and attractively displayed. Coffee, tea, juice, milk. All is included except specialty coffees like cappuccino, for which there is a small extra charge.I'm a technoboob so couldn't get WiFi to work in our room. I took my phone to the front desk and they helped me with it. Friendly, helpful, and multi-lingual.All in all, this is a well-located, comfortable, modern hotel.Via Napo Torriani is lined on both sides with similar hotels, as well as trats and restaurants. The subway station is a 1-minute walk. The Central train station takes maybe 5 minutes with luggage. Milan is a business city, so while it's pleasant and leafy, you won't find historical glories around every corner. The Hotel Atlantic is two blocks from a large business center with banks and ATMs, and a few subway stops from the Duomo and Gallerie Vittorio Emmanuel with all the fashion shops.I checked the budget box. We paid about $850 for five people in two rooms for three nights, which seems reasonable. You can probably spend a lot more, and you could also find a hostel for less.Note about the price: We booked in March or April for our May 30-June 2 stay, and needed one more night, June 13, before flying home. Between June 2 and 13, the tourist season must have changed, because the same rooms were quoted as twice as much for June 13. So we didn't stay there.","June 21, 2019","15    c-hotels Atlantic

821,"Had some difficulty finding the location on my GPS but eventually found it after 20mins. The building is located behind another hotel that's right across the Milan Central Station so you may face some confusion if it's your first time thereNote that upon entering the hotel, you will need to descend some stairs so if you need help with your luggage, let the staff know! Check in was relatively easy and the staff are informative and friendly.We were lucky to get the top floor and even though our room was a little small (we booked an Economy Double Room), we still had just enough space to work around it. Do also note that the hair dryer in the bathroom cannot be switched on for too long and it will just stop working when it gets to a certain temperature, so ladies with long hair, do take note.Another thing is that the lift is quite small so sometimes it can get a little uncomfortable if you have other guests who insist on taking the lift with you (there's not much room for personal space!)Other than that, the hotel is overall okay.","June 3, 2019","15    c-hotels Atlantic

844,"We have just returned from 3 days in Milan and stayed at this hotel. If like us, you are looking for a well located bolt hole then this hotel is ideal. It is located within a 10 minute walk of central station, making it really easy to get to from the airport. A shuttle was €14 return, bought at Malpensa airport. You can see the metro station entrance from the hotel entrance, which is excellent for getting around Milan( it’s too big to walk everywhere). €4.50/€8 for 24/48 hour travel card for the metro(bought from the metro station). The staff at the hotel were friendly, helpful and spoke good English. The hotel will store luggage for you if you arrive too early for check in or after you check out so you can continue exploring before you need to fly home. The rooms are small but we found this consistent with other expensive cities such as London or New York where space is a premium. The rooms are well appointed and nicely decorated however are a little noisy and could do with more sound proofing but, like us, if you are getting back late and leaving early to enjoy maximum exploring then it’s not too much of an issue. We didn’t eat breakfast at the hotel as there are many places In Milan you can get breakfast. All in all this is a good ideal for the price. My top tips for visiting Milan would be to visit Navigli canal(Porta Genova metro station I think). It has a fab atmosphere and plenty of bars and restaurants. This was our favourite place in Milan. Also the QC Terme thermal spa if you have time and like that sort of thing. It was fab and we spent nearly all day there. Happy travelling. X ","February 16, 2019","15    c-hotels Atlantic

861,"We have a great time at c-hotels Atlantic, it is just 5mins walk away from Milano Centrale station which is very convenient if you're dragging heavy luggage, the room is very clean and decent in size compared to other rooms in Italia, it maybe far if you walk to the tourist spots but taking the metro is quite a breeze in getting to the center. Being near to the train station made our daily trip to Lake Como and St. Moritz, Switzerland very easy. Yes you read that right, Switzerland, You can make a day tour by taking the Bernina Express train going to St. Moritz via Tirano, it is the highest railway to the alps, may i also remind you, the views are breathtaking. The breakfast is good made even better by the friendly filipino staffs. Big plus, it also has an asian grocery store right across the street. ","October 20, 2018","15    c-hotels Atlantic

865,"Stayed here 3 nights. Room was really lovely with a nice view looking over street and was very spacious with a small dressing room and lovely bathroom. No bath. Fridge which isn't always in all hotels. This is a modern hotel and everything is fresh and new looking. Flat location which made accessing with luggage easier on the cobblestone pathways.Breakfast included and was good with hot and cold foods, coffees to order and nice staff. This hotel is used by Tour Companies so breakfast can sometimes get very busy and I did encounter some rude people but that isn't the hotels fault. The location is right across the road from Central Station. This is a major railway station with trains to all over Italy and beyond as well as the Metro Station. It is an easy walk with or without luggage from the hotel. There are Taxi's at the station which I also used a couple of times. There are several restaurants and shops within the Station. Several restaurants are located near the hotel although as was travelling alone, was advised not to be out walking alone late at night. The restaurants were close but I did make sure I was back in before too late. There are a few beggars and people selling things who approach you but didn't encounter any problems and just a shake of head saying No usually had them moving on. Hop On Hop Off Bus and Bus Tours leave from opposite side of Station.I would certainly recommend staying here if using Rail Transport as the location is ideal however apart from a few restaurants, the area doesn't have many shops and can be a bit isolated. The Hotel however is fabulous.","June 11, 2019","16    Starhotels E.c.ho.

The hotel has a nice & warm design- interior & exterior. The room was equipped with all the necessary things. It is a bit small for 2 people & so is the bath room. Breakfast was ok and offered quite satisfying selection. It was my first night at this hotel (usually i stay at another hotel in milan regularly) and it was ok for one night- good money value. The only thing that bothered me was the shading curtains- was not wide enough and in the morning, the light got in to the room. As being sensitive to day light that was annoying.

It was on the 3rd floor but we still could hear underground trains.The water in the shower was brown when you switched it on. Just after 5 min running it became transparent.

I was told that I would be charged on my check out day.Here my nightmare has started: every night I saw ""pre-authorisations"" charged on my card. Hotel staff couldn't help me as their system did that automatically and they even didn't see all of the charges. By check out moment I was overcharged for 900 euros more than I had to pay. At check out I was assured that over charge would be returned in a few days cause it was just pre-authorisation and that my card was removed from the system.A few days after check out I got another charge for 1900 euros from this hotel. So total overcharged amount was 2800 euros! I called to the hotel but they didn't see these charges in their system.I had to deal with my bank and I got a refund by the end of the month, in about 3 weeks!

Huge room with separate bedroom and lounge as well as a balcony.Overall a nice comfortable stay.,"April 19, 2018","16    Starhotels E.c.ho.

901,"Stayed here during my visit to Milan on March 2018. The hotel located just opposite the train station. Easy access even with big luggage. We reach the hotel very early in the morning due to our flight schedule, we are unable to check in at that time we we can drop our luggage. Hotel staffs are friendly, room was clean. However, we think the bed can be improved Too soft for our liking and we think that two single bed combined to become a king size bed is not so comfortable to sleep in. Hotel breakfast was good, good selections and delicious. Overall, this hotel is good and will stay here again for my next visit.","April 12, 2018","16    Starhotels E.c.ho.

Hotel is located near to Milan Central Station which was major advantage for us. Staff of the hotel is very courteous and friendly. Rooms were little small but properly decorated so it didn't effect us much. Rooms were very clean, wash room wash very clean too. Breakfast was very good. Being vegetarian we prefer Indian food there are a couple of Indian restaurants walking distance to the hotel. Hotel was very accommodative we asked for checkout at 1 PM against regular time of 12 Noon we were granted that without hassle.I would highly recommend this hotel if you want to stay close to Indian restaurant options as well as Milan Central Station.","April 1, 2018","16    Starhotels E.c.ho.

That is very unusual , The rooms air conditioning seems to be controlled by reception , ?? the in room controller seems to have no effect, the room was far too hot, opening window was too noisy , I asked for assistance 5 times , had various attempts, even had a visit from staff member . They offered to move rooms but that was late one night, not practical I was in bed !! The offer was genuine but no practicality . They claimed a technician came one day but no change in my opinion. If you want a noisy air conditioner fan running all night just to have warm breeze (light sleepers beware) to blow hot air around , this is the place for you , I am here in January , !!!! summer in my opinion will be a nightmare , very genuine staff but no sign of management or ownership of the issues, no follow up I will not be back.

910,"Very clean hotel but that's about it.I was not pleased with the check-in. The receptionist was skeptical whether he should take our IDs and not passports as he was not aware if my country was in the EU or nor which it has been for the past 10 years. It felt like he kept looking down on us and especially when you have seen that he was treating the check-in before us nicer, it makes a big difference. Not very good soundproofing of the rooms as well. Our neighbors kept banging their door at all times during the night. Extremely unpleasant when you are on holiday and trying to relax...The worst part came after we checked-out. I forgot my keys in the room, unfortunately. As I work in a hotel, I am fully aware of the procedures and was willing to pay for the postage myself. However, the hotel informed me that it would cost me 70 euros to send a pair of keys from Italy to UK which took me aback as usually a postage overseas does not cost that much. After a few weeks of trying to arrange a collection unsuccessfully, my boyfriend emailed them in Italian and they told him they can send it for 15 euros... You can imagine how I felt... So because I don't speak Italian and I am not Italian, I have to pay 55 euro more... I will not recommend!!! Very poor service!!! I would rate minus if I can!","November 3, 2017","16    Starhotels E.c.ho.

Hotel was fine, nicely furnitured, even the extra bed (couch) was with one affordable matrace built in. The air condition setting fixed, could not really set and turning off seemed to be impossible.

To my great surprise, during my fourth stay in the hotel (I had to stay in the same hotel unfortunately since there was no other availability that specific week in Milan) another one of my dresses gone missing. I can now state for a fact that in the course of three weeks, two of my dresses ""miraculously"" went missing while in both cases I was staying at NH Collection Milano President. I contacted the management but they were not interested in my case and said: ""we do not have any type of case to be reported"". I spent the last 4 days of my stay with a ""do not disturb"" sign on the door because I felt unsafe and did not want more of my clothes to go missing. This is extremely frustrating and was terribly handled by the management who insinuated I might have forgotten it somewhere else (although I was staying in their hotel and although I have stayed in multiple hotels around the world as I travel a lot for business and I have never lost or misplaced anything previously)...

The room is fine, but the service was shocking. At this price point one can do much better we think and would just like to warn others before choosing this brand over others.

The current construction site right in front of the hotel was a disappointment, although this is not at all the fault of the hotel. Apparently a new subway stop is being built which will eventually be to the hotel's advantage, but at the moment, the site is loud and disturbing and makes reaching the hotel a challenge.

1003,"We have been all over Italy, but we had never been to Milan. We had a few days with no plans, so we decided to come to Milan pretty last minute (around a month ago). I’m sitting here writing this review in my amazing room here at “The Yard”. We checked in yesterday on 7/5 and WOW does this hotel go above and beyond. We emailed the hotel to use transportation from the airport (we were at the LIN airport and it was 55 euro to the hotel) and were greeted by Matteo, a wonderful host. The staff is very accommodating, and they speak english well!! We mentioned that we needed to leave very early this morning for a tour of Lake Como. Instead of opening up at 8 am (the usual), Stefanie opened up at 6:30 am for us!! Pastries are made in house...delicious.Our room is beautiful. We are staying in room 11, the Smash room (as seen below, all rooms are themed and this is tennis). I recommend others to request it!! We saw online to request a room with a balcony, which we got! I’m very picky about water pressure on showers due to thick hair...this one does the job! I love it! There are a lot of outlets, which are very nice after coming from a hotel in England that had 1 outlet for the 4 devices we needed to charge. We also loved the perks of the mini bar being included in the price as well as a free drink at the bar on the house for each of us - the bartender makes great drinks. The pizza place downstairs (Dirty Gym) is FANTASTIC. The chefs went above and beyond and honestly it was some of the best pizza my mom and I have ever tasted. We will definitely be back one more night, if not both this trip. After a long day of eleven hours of touring, I promise you this is the place you never want to leave. I have seen complaints of noise due to the bar, but we sleep soundly, and our hall has been totally quiet - it is like a dream! It’s going to be very hard leaving after our 4 night stay, we love it here!","July 6, 2019","19    The Yard Hotel

1005,"The hotel has a great location a Navigli with allot of restaurants & bars & amazing nightlife. We stay here during the Fashion week, and yet the price of the hotel with breakfast was costing 360.00 EUR a night. Their executive room = a standard room, so if you expect something else watch-out. In my room there was not even a computer desk, it was a small room but very nice with good shower. At the check-in we were not advised that minibar is included in the price however, I found this out the the check-out when trying to pay for the water, and the same thing happened to my colleague and few others guest, so for sure it is their way to be dishonest , and save monies. When I asked reception team why we've have not been advised about the Minibar , all she say I don't know, not even an apology. Furthermore, the breakfast allot sweet choice but very poor solty choice, and I was disgusted when they asked me to pay 6 eur for the fresh squeezed orange juice, after paying 360,00 EUR night for an executive room which = to small standard room. The Lobby and BAR, I found it very filthy with very old carpets, I personally don't think it has a special design look other than a filth. Evening Lobby Bar, we were waiting for a good 25 minutes if not more to order a two outrageously expensive cocktails, and waited another 20 minutes for the actual drink , and another 15 minutes for the bill. So, all together yea fancy Milan but think twice before you spend monies for The Yard Hotel because the guests are not treated so nicely and they're not appreciative at all.","June 30, 2019","19    The Yard Hotel

Parking garage was tight but it worked. I don’t think anything larger than an economy car could fit in the tight curving driveway down to the basement garage. Staff was lovely. Check In was confusing as there was a private party happening and difficult to understand where the actual lobby/Check In was. The room was nice with a private tiny patio. Nice amenities. Paper thin walls, so the music in the bar/lobby felt like it was just as loud in your room. It was heavy bass music, like a dance club. It seemed like a small hotel, so I’m not sure if there is a room that would be farther from the noise.","June 8, 2019","19    The Yard Hotel

The big issue is the noise, they run a very popular lobby bar which is open until 2am in the morning. We had room 5 on the ground floor, with the corridor being separated by a thin sliding door from the noisy bar. No chance to sleep before 2am, when the music stopped and the bar closed. You may have a better chance to sleep higher up, facing the back, as the bar extends into the front courtyard. If you are a party person, then the hotel is the right one for you.

The decoration of the common parts is absolutely stunning: a talented mix of everything, creating some kind of fancy old English club atmosphere. The rooms are less appealing. First their name is somewhat exaggerated: a junior suite is a small room, a suite is a regular one. The decoration of the room is very variable, depending of the sport pictured. Some are nice and cosy, others are a bit unpleasant (eg the basket ball one). Wifi is free and fast. The bed is comfortable. The breakfast is just okish: a clear weak point, as often in Italy.

However, we felt at home and all are really friendly - best is the managing lady (since about 7 years she is there) at breakfast. The Yard is used by a lot of urban and chic Milan citizens for aperitivo - so from 6.00 to 10.00pm. Cues are in front of the hotel in the evening. Be prepared to present your key.Very individual rooms - each is designed by a specific sport with all the accessories of that sport. Extremely nice. Only reasion to have 4 instead of 5 stars is because of the size of the rooms - really small and not cheap (we paid about 450€ per night for a double).

The selection is varied and I found everything to be fresh! We also had a drink at the bar one night which was fun. They have a well curated menu of drinks to select from. The only improvement I would recommend for this property, is more signage from the street, as we were there sure if it was the right place, along with clearer signs pointing to reception/dining room, as the hotel can be quite confronting when you first arrive, this would be very helpful especially for those arriving after a long haul flight!","January 20, 2019","19    The Yard Hotel

Onsite (albeit tight) parking is available for ~25 Euro overnight.Con!Noise from the lounge area affects most rooms (rooms facing the lounge). On the weekends this can go on until 2am... not recommended for the light sleeper, or if you have a flight/appointment scheduled. Based on the noise alone, I would have given it 3 if I wasn’t so tired that I slept through the noise, and would have given it 5 if noise wasn’t an issue at all. Tip: Request a room in the back if you’re a light sleeper or visiting on the weekend.","November 17, 2018","19    The Yard Hotel

The bar and conversation areas throughout the lower public spaces are amazing. My room had a kitchen, living room, bedroom and outdoor piazza. Underfloor heating in the bath. Staff are outstanding...no request goes unheeded or fulfilled. Breakfast is the best part of the day.

1025,"This hotel is beautiful! We have stayed in a number of 'art hotels', but this one was the most amazing of them all. 'The Yard' is the lobby of the hotel, and looks to be a big antiques shop, chock-a-block with bric-a-brac: stacks of old suitcases, manikins, toy sailboats, gratuitously hand-lettered interior windows reading ""The Secret Society of Mature Individuals"" and maybe ""The No Sleep Detective Agency"". Think The Waldorf on acid. The staff were attractive and graceful; they weren't just stationed behind a desk the way it is in most hotels, but brought us coffee when we arrived after an early flight when our room was not ready yet, and unasked brought a coffee again and a snack when one of us was sitting in the lobby time-shifted-awake the next morning before breakfast. The lobby meanders into numerous siderooms, and all of it had comfortable looking plush furniture. The main room is terraced, and appeared to be open to the sky with a louvered ceiling; I couldn't see how they stopped all the antiques from getting wet in a sudden rainshower. The hallways to the rooms were reached by unobvious doors. We stayed in the room called JFK, and there were interesting pictures on that theme along the walls. Our room was actually quite big, and there was a little balcony with plants on a watering system.Okay, the hotel is not perfect, but what is. A light bulb was out in one of those industrial fixtures in the bathroom (alas, no tub), but we felt shy about bringing it to the attention of the staff. There was a crack in the glass in a corner by the foot of a chair on the balcony. The bed pillows could really be better.And you have to understand that it is a bit of a walk into the main area around the Duomo. But the Navigli area is great, too. Think Camden Town in London. The canals are crowded in the evening on a Friday or Saturday to an extent that it is sometimes difficult to walk along some of them and over the bridges due to all the people. There are countless restaurants along the canals soaking up the business from the restaurants along the surrounding streets. The restaurants included many happy hour buffets of all-you-can-eat-and-one-drink for 10 Euros, mid-range restaurants serving plates of good pasta and pizzas, and some restaurants trying to be a little higher end. There was an interesting bar scene on the weekends at the Yard, where locals flooded the place-to-be-seen lobby.I've read a number of things here about the breakfasts at the Yard, and wanted to comment. The breakfasts were fine. The breakfasts are continental. It's not the way it is in Norway, where the hotels are in a competition to win an award to have the best breakfast feast with seven varieties of eggs. But here there were croissants and bread and some cheeses and sliced meats and yogurt and fruit and juices. Little baked goods and sweet delicacies, too. The breakfasts were fine.Overall, we were really happy that we stayed here. The way our flights were, we stayed here two nights at the beginning of our trip, and two nights after our trip again in Milan, when we stayed in a different hotel closer the center. But we were glad to have experienced The Yard.","November 9, 2018","19    The Yard Hotel

The bathroom was a great size although the shower itself is a little tight. Not a bad thing, just a heads up. The staff was very friendly and helpful, especially when we arrived very early on our check-in day. They held our bags for us and recommended several things to do/see until the room was ready. We utilized the bar most nights for apertivo and enjoyed breakfast each morning as well. It's in a great location as well as everything you'll want to see is probably a 15-20 minute walk away.

1032,"Honestly, we didn't know what to expect when we pulled up in front of a black garage with a large #8 stenciled on it. I called the hotel to see where I might deposit the car, and they asked if I saw the #8. I did, and soon the garage open its doors to swallow my Fiat 500L Prior to The Yard Milano, my favorite boutique hotel was The Cotton House in Barcelona. Elegant, quirky, modern all at the same time. I now have a new fave in The Yard. We honestly didn’t know what to expect. My wife thought we’d made another mistake along the lines of our first hotel in Porto, but to her (and my) surprise, this wasn’t the case.Nine years ago, The Yard Milano was a private residence. It was converted to a hotel six years ago with just six rooms. The owner began buying out the rest of the building and today, the property boasts 32 rooms, each of which is decorated with a different sports theme. Ours, Room 11, was called Smash and was adorned with tennis photos, rackets and the like. It came with a private outdoor seating area, modern bathroom, and comfy king-sized bed with a TY stenciled at the foot.If you like Ralph Lauren home décor, this hotel is Ralph on steroids. Nearly every surface in the its public and private rooms is covered with some eye-catching item or image seemingly acquired over a lifetime of attending estate and tag sales. But don’t get me wrong. It all works amidst deep lush reds and blacks. Words can’t describe, but the interior photos I took might.","October 5, 2018","19    The Yard Hotel

The amenities are first class, the rooms extremely comfortable and spacious, the little terrace wonderful for meals, there were enough electrical outlets for our many gadgets, enough hangers, fluffy pillows, a great mattress, an I-phone for our use during the stay, free drinks in the minibar, enough reading light next to the bed, the shower powerful and large and breakfast sumptuous and with freshly squeezed juices (which is also rare). It's obviously that a lot of thought has gone into making this Hotel special, and we like special! One suggestion is to have a menu in the rooms, or at least something explaining the hours of operation, and restaurants with menus available, including room service, which as it turned out is available, but we did not know.

1037,"The hotel is very trendy and was overall fine, but there were small issues that prevented me from giving five stars. It felt like people like the hotel for its design more than for any other reason. Issues I found included: the room we were in needs to be repainted and maintained a little bit better. The front desk staff is fine but nowhere near what you’d call ‘warm’, and I think warmth and personalization are what you should expect from such a small boutique hotel. It took 25 minutes for an iron and an ironing board to be sent up to the room. If you’re not going to provide an iron and a board in the rooms, please do not take so long to deliver one to the room. And perhaps I’m missing the point of their brand, but there seemed to be very little signage anywhere. The little hallway coming out of the elevator is super dark with a sign to the lobby that is unlit and super hard to decipher and see. The hotel was hard to find. They also lock the gate outside with a small intercom with which to call the front desk to open. All of this is okay, but the front desk should have explained this upon check-in. The key to the room is my own personal gripe: it is not a key card but an actual key with a gigantic keychain, which is cute but is a pain when you’re leaving the hotel to go out to dinner or something with its bulk and weight.The hotel had sent an email before our stay to warn us that the hotel street would be congested due to the F1 race. Great: but they did not provide information on hourly parking nearby (so that we could have parked the car and gone with our luggage to the hotel on foot until the race was over) or times in which to try and drive in (this would have been helpful to know, as we were driving in from Parma, and we would have left at least an hour earlier had we known they were closing the street at 1pm). All they said was it was going to be backed up. I know that all of these things are tiny issues, but I guess this is just me being a little disappointed with a hotel that’s ranked this high on TripAdvisor and only has 30-some odd rooms. It just felt like there was no real management. ","August 31, 2018","19    The Yard Hotel

This hotel has the same feel as The Hoxton in Amsterdam where we stayed earlier in the year in that it is quirky, friendly (a particular mention to Valeria for her help, advice and importantly her good humour on reception) and in short, somewhere we would stay again when in Milan! The rooms are well presented with many cool fixtures and fittings such as Sky TV, well designed bathroom fittings and good lighting, but it's the overall ambiance that sells it to both myself and my wife. The reception area and lounge area are bright and full of sporting curiosities. The bar is well stocked with a gentleman behind it that can converse knowledgeably on his whiskies and gins with gusto. The communal areas are filled with an eclectic mix of memorabilia which makes the hotel unique in our opinion and we are looking forward to the rest of our stay whilst in this beautiful city.

But here’s the rub: I was sitting at a couch sipping a cocktail for an hour watching this frenetic blonde hostess race around the room arranging glasses, moving magazines on tables - just disrupting any sort of casual flow the room was set up to create. Then, she stops at my table and tells me I’m going to have to move soon because a party of 15 is going to take over my spot! Um Excuse me?

Went on the M3 line to main Centrale Station and got the train up to Lake Como [ about 1 hour ] and had a lovely day there. Read a few negative reviews about staff etc. but found all the staff to be very welcoming and attentive. Very nice breakfast with plenty of choice and Elena also very attentive to guests needs. Rooms are very comfortable and standard of cleanliness very good.

1066,"Stayed in this property after the usual hotels I go to in Milano were fully booked. The price/quality equation for this hotel is exceptional. It is centrally located near the historical town center, and equidistant from two metro stations. The hotel is located in a modern office tower, consequently the rooms are on the small side, but well appointed with comfortable beds and well appointed bathrooms. The breakfast, which is included in the price was decent although the service to get an expresso can sometimes be slow if there are many people. The staff at the reception were efficient and friendly. I would gladly return to this property. My only complaint concerns the coffee/tea facilities in the room. Instead of having proper China tea cups, there were only disposable paper cups which I find unacceptable for a four star hotel.","February 9, 2019","20    Uptown Palace

1067,"My wife and I recently stayed 3 nights at the Uptown Palace in Milan. This was part of a long tour in which we stayed at 5 Italian hotels, and this one was truly the best.As soon as we arrived someone took our luggage and delivered it to our room.Checkin was relatively fast (we experienced long waits and inexplicably long processing at some of the other hotels) with 3 receptionists waiting when we arrived.We were first given a small room with a window directly facing an adjacent apartment building. After complaining we were transferred to a much larger room on the 12th floor with a mountain view! (Note that Duomo views are only from executive suites, and they really don't see much of the Duomo anyway!)The location is reasonable - it is about a 10 minute walk to the Duomo or Vittorio Emanuele. Taxi from the train station is about 15 minutes and 15 Euro. You can ask them to arrage a taxi to the airport which takes about 45 minutes and they will charge 100E to your bill. Brera is a 20 minute walk. One day we walked in a random direction and quickly found ourselves in a lovely residential neighborhood with local shops. Our stay included breakfast which is on the 3rd floor and very nice with cloth tablecloths and napkins. Staff immediately removes used plates with smiles on their faces, and are happy to bring you your capuchino or tea (no extra charge as in some hotels).There is a nice large lobby area where you can sit at the end of a long day if you don't want to be cooped up in your room. This was the only hotel on our trip to Italy that had a variety of English language TV stations, including BBC world news and CNN. However, the Internet connectivity is not very good - the WiFi signal is strong both in the room and in the lobby, but the connectivity frequently drops.I wouldn't hesitate to call this a 1st class luxury hotel, were it not for maintenance issues. In our shower (which had a great rain shower head) the soap dish wobbled. The closet had a LED lighting strip with proximity detector, but it had become detached from the closet and was dangling at one end. I happened to see a maintenance employee and showed him the issues, and when we returned at the end of the day everything was fixed! That was great, but this kind of thing should be taken care of without my mentioning it.However, I can't complain. I can only highly recommend the Uptown Palace.","February 6, 2019","20    Uptown Palace

1068,It is know that check in is usually after 1:00pm since check-out is at 12:00pm. However the hotel was more than happy to check me in a bit earlier than usual at 10:00am. It was a nice gesture that made a difference with me.,"February 2, 2019","20    Uptown Palace

1069,"Fantastic location and really comfortable rooms! The staff are very friendly and the bar is pleasant. The reason I gave 4 and not 5 was because our double bed was actually 2 single beds pushed together which made certain “activities“ challenging, the hairdryer worked intermittently and the aircon was not great. Even after setting the room temperature to 21c it never dropped below 25c. Overall really good hotel and would definitely use again. ","January 14, 2019","20    Uptown Palace

1070,"Overall our stay at Uptown Palace was very pleasant. The hotel decor is nice with a luxurious feel, although I can see in some of the details why it isn’t rated 5 star. The rooms are very small, we were told we were upgraded upon check in to a ‘superior room’ although the size of this room was smaller than most regular rooms I have stayed in. Nevertheless the decor was nice and the bathroom was a nice touch with large shower and double sinks. One thing that has bothered us during our stay, was we seemed to be incredibly itchy. Both me and my partner found ourselves scratching all over during our stay in the bed. I will be keeping an eye out for any bed bug bites over the next few days (although I have a feeling it was a sensitivity to the washing detergent used on the sheets, and not down to bed bugs as we would have seen bites sooner if that were the case). In addition the rooms were ridiculously hot. We couldn’t seem to get the AC to work, and one night our thermostat read 26 degrees, which for a good nights sleep, is definitely not ideal. We both enjoy walking so it wasn’t a problem that the hotel was about a 15 minute walk from Duomo and the main shops. The only issue we found was in general there seemed to be very little in terms of restaurants near the hotel which meant we had to walk late at night in the dark, down some rather sketchy looking side streets. Yet again it might have been because of the time of the year with there being less people and things open. Not sure we will return to Milan, although for the cost of the stay and the friendly service of the staff, it was worth the visit. ","January 5, 2019","20    Uptown Palace

1071,"We‘ve mainly had a great stay at the „Uptown Palace“ . The room was modern and warmly decorated, the staff was friendly and welcoming at all times. Nevertheless, there was a drop of bitterness after all. Upon checkin, we got a letter from the General Manager saying: VIP access! Your benefit as a Expedia VIP Member is: 20% off on FB services and early check in and late check out upon availability.I asked two different receptionists if we could check out about 2 hours later. They wanted to charge 50 Euro because it is a holiday (Jan. 1). Why handing out such a letter in the first place then! It makes guests feel special first, but in the end, if not fullfilled as promised, it leaves a sour taste to an initially perfect stay. Pitty. I‘ve filed a complaint at the reception. I then was told that 50€ for late checkout at 2 pm already is a special treatment. The hotel was „almost“ full, we couldn‘t sell the room, if we had granted extended checkout, and whatnot... Well, obviously, almost full means, there are still rooms available and if they can give us the room for two hours longer for 50€, they also could give it for free as promised in the letter.Anyways, as already had: Misleading letter, left a sour taste and we left the hotel dissappointed.

1077,"We booked three rooms here for my 40th birthday celebrations in Milan and despite telling the staff at check-in I ended up with the worst room. Staff performed a perfunctory rather than welcoming role. The room I was given was designed as an accessible bedroom (which I didn’t have a need for), with adapted bathroom facilities but there’s no need for a revolting shower curtain. I find them unhygienic (see picture). I was quite jealous when I saw the rest of my family’s rooms. There was no complimentary water in the room and the coffee ‘cups’ were polystyrene. One of the rooms in our party did have a coffee machine, so they were pleased. There was a turn down service and a little treat left on the bed. The hotel is in a good location, it’s clean and the breakfast is adequate. The bar is small and brightly lit but the staff were good when there was a mix up with the drinks order. There was a small problem on check out in that they attempted to charge us twice for city tax as it hadn’t been put on their system, but it was quickly resolved.

1079,"I stayed at this hotel on 9/6/18. The staff was excellent in assisting with the parking situation, and giving me directions to the hotel. However, GPS made the arrival a disaster for me. First...this is downtown Milan, so the fact that the hotel uses a garage is not unusual. The garage is literally located behind the hotel. It is convenient and very safe, once you find it. The fact that Milan is a series of one way streets, or streets with bus lanes and streetcars makes navigation difficult. Simply put...the hotel is on the main drag...but there is a small side street running parallel and ends right at the hotel entrance...so you need to turn in before you stop the hotel entrance. A challenge. Drive to the parking garage first...get out...walk to the hotel is easiest. Inside, the hotel is really very nice. The rooms are great, and my view was a huge window overlooking the Basilica di San Calimero and the main street. There is a nice bar open late, and the people at the front desk are great at helping you find a place to eat. Staff brought my bags up, took them and stored them, and were always helpful no matter the ask. Rooms are very stylish...perfect size, and very, very clean. Bathrooms are exceptional. This is more a boutique hotel than a grand palace...it is all dark colors and gold...very stylish. The bed is heaven though. Location is on a main street and about a 10-12 min walk to the Piazza Duomo. Very convenient. Tons of restaurants around...and there is a store right around the corner.

We scoured the area to find a touch of Milan but struggled.Sure there are 2 Carrefour stores just nearby but when on holidays a series of restaurants to choose from is vital.Our room was really beautiful as we had chosen the suite which had great views of the Duomo from the bedroom and the city from the lounge. There were 2 separate marble bathrooms both really lovely and very clean. Staff were so very helpful and the lobby is modern. The approach to the hotel is that of a multi story box and not so inviting. We had safety concerns about a single revolving front entry/exit door with no separate manual opening door for large groups or emergency occasions.The breakfast room is very depressing and unfortunately it matches the level of food served at breakfast.

Of course we assured them of the safety of its contents. They consented and made sure our bags were safe. A metro stop was being constructed right in front of the hotel but there was no noise nor dust. The quaint little family-run restaurant next door offered good home-style pastas and pizza. The hotel was 2 minutes from the road-tram (#12, #16 If i am not mistaken, which leads to straight to the Duomo). UPtown Palace was at a great location: we didn't want to be too close to where all tourists are and this hotel is at a more ""residential"" area.

A first rate breakfast buffet, rooms that tall people can fit in (a little small by North American standards but better than a typical New York City room), excellent appointments in room and public areas, amazing front desk and bell staff.Mind you they are rebuilding the subway station directly outside the hotel, so noise sensitive types should ask for a Courtyard facing room at the back!However the lack of a fitness room and rather overpriced in hotel dining are drawbacks - both of which could be fixed if management wanted to.","June 24, 2018","20    Uptown Palace

I stay 2 nights in a junior suite, the reception was very nice and helpfull but the extra bed in the suite was below average and the 2 nights were noisy due to ambulance going full noise to the nearby hospital in the middle of the night.

1097,"As a person that works in a Hotel whenevr i travel i always check trip advisor for the latest comments of the property where i will be staying. I contact the property itself and i book directly. Thats what i have done for my 1 night in Milan with the Uptown Palace. Initially i was looking for a Hotel away from noise, centrally located and 4* category. I booked mtystay directly with the Hotel. Reservation department was very very helpful. Upon arrival we were given room on the 10th floor. The room was cleaned to a high standard and it was big. Bed and pillows very comfortable. Reception desk very helpful. Breakfast of a very good quality. Easy to get a taxi from the Reception. I would like to mention Patricia from the Accounts department that helped me out when i had a query about my preauthorisation, she really went the extra mile to hekp me out. The Hotel must be proud of having such an employee. Would definitely go back to this Hotel on my next trip to Milan and would definitely recommend the Hotel.

1099,If you are traveling from oversees and have early arrival DO NOT book this hotel. When I made a reservation to the Deluxe Room I specifically asked to have my room a little earlier if possible since I was traveling from New York with my 12 y/o daughter. When we arrived at 9am the room wasn’t ready. I inquired when to come back the receptionist replied that check-in time is at 2pm and we should have reserved our room earlier and pay for extra night to be able to have our room as early as 9am. Unbelievable!!!!! And this is instead of offering me and my daughter to go and have a breakfast that they were still serving on 3rd floor! What a “wonderful” way to greet people from another continent! ,"May 25, 2018","20    Uptown Palace

1100,Great hotel. Short taxi ride from airport (less than 20 euros). Warm welcome. Good service -- in particular we were initially given a room on the 3rd floor near the restaurant and then asked if we could be moved to a quieter room. We were promptly moved to a lovely room on the 8th floor. Clean room with modern facilities. Twin sinks and amazing shower. We didn't test the breakfast -- we preferred to walk into the city to try any of the enormous number of excellent cafes. The hotel is located within easy walking distance of the duomo and other sites of interest. Highly recommended.,"May 24, 2018","20    Uptown Palace

Note that some rooms have shower only; Wifi was not working in my room, but did in others (was travelling with colleagues). For an Italian hotel, the breakfast is quite good, with a reasonable choice and homemade products; for self-caterers (eg water), there is a supermarket next door with long opening hours.","May 12, 2018","20    Uptown Palace

1102,"I think some of the reviews below are too harsh. Yes breakfast is a bit functional, yes free wi-fi is a bit slow (fine for browsing) and yes there's a faint whiff of sewage in parts of the corridors (probably more to do with Continental drainage systems than anything else). However, fundamentally this is an impressive, very well located hotel that you'll feel good about coming back to after a day's sightseeing (which is how I judge a hotel). If you fly to Linate like I did you can get to and from this hotel for the grand sum of €3, the current bus terminus being less than a 10min walk away. I spent a couple of nights here to in order to see several art galleries and walked everywhere. The Duomo and centre is less than 10 mins away and pretty much all the of the major galleries (plus the canal) within 25 mins and that's ignoring all public transport. If you've landed on this hotel I'd just book it and save yourself the time on more research.","May 4, 2018","20    Uptown Palace

1103,"To the contrary of the few bad reviews posted for Uptown Palace, i was pleasantly surprised that i had a really wonderful stay! Reception staff was helpful from the time of check-in to our departure. The room is really new and clean! I had an enjoyable stay! The bathroom is really huge with 2 separate sinks. The only complain we had was the faulty hair dryer. The hair dryer would die off once we on it on max and could only work on low air. This meant that our long locks needed more time to dry. Plus point, there's air-conditioning in the room.The location of Uptown Palace was amazing. 5mins walk down the road is a Carrefour express and had everything we needed. A Pharmacy is also right around the corner. Duomo Milan is a 15-20mins walk away and so easy to navigate. The only downside is that the area outside the hotel is under metro construction now and I'm not sure how would the noise level be for the hotel guests in the day. All in all, we had an enjoyable stay.","April 27, 2018","20    Uptown Palace

1104,"Rooms were clean and modern and overall a nice stay in Milan. Breakfast was decent and had good choices. However, WIFI connection was horrible and we could barely do anything online with their FREE WIFI. Don't market something as FREE if you are not going to provide it earnestly. I had so much of trouble making online tour bookings or even checking-in for flights; basic for web browsing and not movie download. I've stayed in other 3-star hotels that had better WIFI connection then here. When i called down to the reception for some help with our local tour booking, i was just told they tried too and couldn't do the same thing due to a site issue on the vendor side and not on their WIFI; they also recommended i upgrade to the premium high-speed WIFI for 9euros a day. All in all i think the poor wifi is a ploy to get people to upgrade. Generally, very disappointing for a business hotel. I doubt you will be able to send any emails from this hotel. Other then this, hotel, while is walking distance to Duomo can be a little far for those that don't prepare very long walks. it is about 2 tram rides away, so not very close. Good that there is a supermarket close by but other then that there is nothing much within the vicinity. I wouldn't mind coming back here or recommending this place only if they upgrade their wifi connections. If Wifi is a must for you on trips, don't bother with this hotel; the snail speed will drive you up the wall.","April 5, 2018","20    Uptown Palace

But a kettle with tea bags and coffee are available.-The bed was uncomfortable and the pillows were the worst I have ever used, it guarantees you a neck pain next morning.- Coffee at breakfast tastes like dirty black water (sorry for the description).Not recommended at all","April 2, 2018","20    Uptown Palace

1107,"I write from my room at the Uptown Palace. It is a little on the small size and feels quite dark on this rather grey March morning. On the plus side, there is a decent size and comfortable bed and my bathroom really quite smart with a spacious shower. I can see why this would be considered a 4* hotel even if the accommodation is not quite as plush as I have seen elsewhere.I have two tips for staying here. Firstly, accept that you will want to pay Eur9 per day for internet connection and, secondly, go out to eat. I didn’t pay the Eur9, not least because I object to paying for internet connectivity, but trying to work on my laptop was then a slow and frustrating experience. I can’t say that the restaurant serves bad food and actually service over dinner was good and efficient but the room is dreadfully lacking in character and ambience. I think a short walk would probably serve you well.","March 28, 2018","20    Uptown Palace

1120,"We recently stayed at Best Western Madison for two nights. The hotel is conveniently located in walking distance to Milano Centrale station and bus exchange, with shuttle buses to the airport. The area did appear somewhat sketchy though and possibly unsafe at night.Overall the staff were friendly and helpful. The complimentary wifi was appreciated, as was the generous sized elevator. The room was standard size. The bathroom was quite big, however despite placing the sign on the door, we were only provided with one towel each for the two nights. The shower pressure was also quite weak. The room was mostly quiet in regards to road noise however there was a pervading, intermittent banging noise throughout the entire stay that we could not identify. The bed was quite hard also. As such, this coupled with the noise led to poor sleep. We also had difficulty turning the heat down in the room so it became quite hot and stuffy, and opening the windows let in traffic noise.The major let-down was the food. We ordered room service a couple of times including pizza, two types of pasta, and steak. The pizza (when it was actually available) was mostly fine but was only available on one night. The pastas were lacklustre in flavour. The steak was very tough, fatty, and inedible. My partner ordered a toasted sandwich and it was burnt (see photo). The bread provided was also stale and disappointing. I also think charging 5.50 euro for the room delivery is excessive. A buffet breakfast is offered in the restaurant each morning. Unfortunately it was disappointing. Toast was very difficult to make and took a very long time. The hot food was rubbery and lukewarm, and the eggs tasted “fake”. The pastries were also stale and I saw a hair in the fruit salad.","January 23, 2019","21    Best Western Hotel Madison

1138,"Stayed here for 2 nights in May 2018. Initially my review was going to be much different than a rating of ""4"" but the hotel staff was able to change my mind. After arriving, our room seemed to be quite warm, compared to the lobby and adjacent hallway. I inquired to the front desk, which sent someone up to check on it within minutes. After adjustment of the thermostat, we stayed in the room for about another hour. There didn't seem to be any difference in temperature happening. We decided to go out for dinner, and mentioned to the front desk that if there was no change by the time we got back, we would be requesting a different room. After dinner we arrived back almost 2 hours later. As we entered, the front desk mentioned that they checked and there was no problem with the room. Upon entering the room its temperature felt no different. We gathered our belongings, and went back to the front desk. They gave us a different room with much better air circulation, and temperature. The room was upgraded from a regular room to a suite, which was very nice of the staff, even though we did not ask for that. Comparing the two rooms, the suite was very nice due to the extra space, however the regular room definitely had a more recently renovated bathroom. The hotel breakfast (included with the room rate) was EXCELLENT, with lots of various items to chose from. Overall, I would recommend this hotel, and would consider staying there again.","June 8, 2018","21    Best Western Hotel Madison

It is only a few minutes walk to Milano centrale when you can easily get to anywhere in the city via train/metro/tram. The staff were brilliant and told us the best areas to go for what we wanted. The hotel was clean and the room was always in perfect condition when we returned on an evening. The bed was so comfortable, I slept wonderfully every night. Our room was on the side that faced the church so our view was always lovely. It is a quiet road so there was rarely any noise. Breakfast was beautiful, definitely worth the price. Everything was fresh and there was a great variation of meats, breads, fruit juice, cakes etc. The staff were also very welcoming and attentive every morning. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay, it was close enough to the city for us to easily access everything but far enough not to be too expensive and loud. There were lots of restaurants within walking distance where we had some great meals, and there is also lots of good shopping in the train station only a few minutes away.

1145,"My wife and I stayed in this hotel for four nights while in Milan. The hotel is two blocks from Milan Central Station. You get out of the station from the right side instead of the front. Look for the signs for buses and taxis. You walk straight two block- you will see a big church in the end of the second block which is where the hotel is located. The streets are well lit and we felt safe walking the area in the evening- being watchful, of course. The hotel is very clean and the room and bathroom were very good in size. The front desk staff were helpful, specially Stefano. He was very customer friendly with a very humble disposition. We left for Verona for two days and then came back to stay at this hotel for the remain of our stay. The hotel held our luggage for those two days at no cost !!!!! this is a great service and a great reason to stay here. We were able to bring only a carry on with us which was very nice. One thing though, on our second visit, the room assigned to us had the thermostat locked at almost 80 degrees F. (26 C). I called the front desk and they send me someone who had no idea how to fix it. I called the front desk again and a gentleman came to assess the situation. He offered me another room, but with a queen bed instead of a king bed. The room was also much smaller in size. No discount was offered to me. But, in lieu of all the positives, I left it alone.","March 5, 2018","21    Best Western Hotel Madison

1147,"Staff were nice and we had a lovely modern room with wood flooring and a good amount of space in both the bedroom and bath (shower) room (although not sure if the accessible rooms have more space than the other rooms, for some reason we were given an accessible room, perhaps it was the only twin room left...), it was generally quiet except when we could hear the toilet flushing from the room next door.Things which could have been better was to have curtains or be able to control the external window blinds, there was only see-through nets and the external blinds were halfway down and we didn't know how to control them (if we could). Lastly it was a bit disappointing the bed linen wasn't changed as I noticed a small stain on my duvet cover which I didn't fuss about because I thought I'll let them change it the next morning but they didn't, makes me wonder if their housekeeping knows the procedure that's on the hotel's changing bed linen card left in the room, I intentionally read it but it made no difference, if not for this issue then I would have given this hotel 4 out of 5.","November 5, 2017","21    Best Western Hotel Madison

1179,My family of 3 stayed for 3 nights in Klima Hotel in Milan.Pros:Clean and tidyGreat for business stayHas Tea in the roomClose to motorwayQuiet even with room on motorway side. Good shower pressure Good bedsSlippers provided. Cons:No coffee in the room. Room felt cold all the time. Perhaps because it has tiled floors with no rugs. But slippers are provided. Nothing close by for food so had to use room service. Although there is a supermarket close by 5 mins drive. Staff didn’t seem to be interested especially when we ordered room service or didn’t speak English so was hard to communicate as we dont speak Italian. €10 per day for car park. Stayed in the green painted room as per internet pic. Why green?There’s no concierge. Had to bring bags to room ourselves. This is a very business stay oriented hotel. And above is just my experience. I would give it a 3 star. ,"January 13, 2019","22    Klima Hotel Milano Fiere

Also the prices at the hotel were very reasonable: €2.50 for a mini bar beer and €10 to leave the car in the underground parking for the night. The room was very nice & clean, large comfy bed and a very italian stylish bathroom with rain shower. The TV has about 300 chanels, every single one in Italian, but Wi-Fi is free so what do I care, right? I skipped breakfast and headed into town, for the 20 ride you really need a car.

Location was fantastic - a stone’s throw from Milano Centrale where we took the train from another city and to the airport.

1222,"My wife booked us into this hotel for my 60th birthday treat. She chose it for it's central location. It's a stones throw from the Central station and a 50 minute bus ride from the airport. Access to the reception area is up a flight of steps, not a big deal really as there is a doorman at hand to assist with heavier bags. There appeared to be a stair lift if you cannot manage stairs. Rooms are serviced daily. We were in room 321, which is at the back of the hotel. The room was quiet, clean and comfortable. Our shower head holder was cracked upon arrival. We mentioned this to reception and it was repaired almost immediately. Our room was a bit noisy art times, but we put this down to the rumbling of trams on the main street. The bar looked very nice, but we didn't use it. Basically your standard city centre hotel.","June 29, 2019","23    NYX Hotel Milan

1224,"We thought this hotel was just okay. On first impressions it looks great - very new and modern, very clean, however it became apparent there were many things that really let the place down. The hotel is not accessible at all and you have to climb several steep steps. There are doormen who are super friendly who help you with your luggage, so that is something, although they are really the only friendly employees here. We liked the art in the hotel and the other quirky features like the arcades. Our room also had a (small) balcony - only a few rooms here do, I believe. There is also a roof terrace, and we had very good weather during our stay.Reception staff were very cold. Room was very small considering the price paid. It is right next to the train station & tram line - good location wise, but very noisy on a night which would be troublesome if you're a light sleeper. Barman who served us drinks on our first night was incredibly rude and aggressive, we had one drink in the bar and decided not to visit again. It was also quite expensive (€20 for 2 drinks). He even slammed snacks down on our table without even stopping to say anything. Very bizarre?! We were woken up at 8am on our first morning by the housekeeping??? This was incredibly weird, they could tell we were in the room so have no idea why they felt this was appropriate. What was even more unusual was that they then waited for us to leave the room to get in and clean? Even though we had then placed a 'do not disturb' sign on the door, they removed this and went in. Never seen anything like it!! Our balcony door broke twice and wouldn't close, we had to get it repaired both times. Very disappointing. The minibar is extortionate, €5 for a can of coke? All of the other hotels we stayed in in Italy had free minibars or much more reasonable prices.We wouldn't stay here again, you can stay at another hotel very close to the train station which has a much larger room and a spa bath, with incredibly helpful and friendly employees as well as a free minibar, for around the same price.","June 21, 2019","23    NYX Hotel Milan

1225,"We are a group travelling to Milan for holiday in June 2019. We chose this hotel for its excellent location (2 min walk from the central train station) and good reviews on tripadvisor. We were glad to have chosen this hotel. Check-in was fast and efficient. We booked a deluxe room with a great panoramic view of the train station. Super clean and spacious rooms for Italian standards. We asked the front desk for local food recommendations and the Italian food recommended was fantastic. I would like to compliment Mr. Filippo, the front desk manager for his outstanding customer service and assistance after my stay. After checking out of the hotel (and flew to Spain already), I realized that I left my money pouch inside the safe of the room. I was very nervous and called NYX for help. Filippo answered my request with a great sense of calmness. With his help, they managed to find my money pouch (with everything still inside!!!). After a few phone calls and emails, he has found a reliable carrier to ship my money pouch back to me. I can't express how thankful I am of Filippo for not only finding my pouch, but also shipped it back to me. THANK YOU VERY MUCH!Without hesitation, I will definitely be recommending NYX Milano hotel to all my friends and relatives to come stay at this fantastic property. NYX is lucky to have such a wonderful and caring staff on their team. Thank you once again Mr Filippo!","June 15, 2019","23    NYX Hotel Milan

1226,"I was put in a room over looking all the tram lines. This was not an issue, but the noise was. I heard the trams passing by the room every 5-7 minutes till about 2.30am in the morning! They were so loud you could hear them even with the TV on. Impossible to sleep. They start back at 5.30am...not sure how they can expect guests to stay in these rooms as there is no way you would get any sleep.

We arrivied late on Friday evening . we flew into Bergamo/orio airport and took the shuttle bus which was 7 euros each takes approx 50 mins to Centrale station which is just were nyx Milan is on the right with 2 gold statues (also there is a huge nyx sign above the hotel. We were checked in by the lovely Roberta i very cheekily told her we had stayed here before and would it be possible to have a free upgrade, she said yes . Well wow wow wow, we had room 432 it was a shock to us we had a junior suite. we had a huge room, sitting area, 2 tvs, dressing gowns, slippers, toiletries etc we felt so spoilt. The shower is amazing and there was plenty of soft towels. We didnt have the breakfast as we want to explore. if you do the breakfast is 10 euros each. This is an amazing hotel with very helpful staffand near the station and metro. You are able to explore Milan and all the surrounding areas. Rome is 3 hours away by train and venice is 2 1/2 hours away by train.Finally would i return to nyx Milan.

1236,"There are a few great things about this hotel but one bad point that all hotels must not make the mistake on. Let's start with the right elements. Firstly it is located just opposite the Milano Centrale station. Next, the decor and furnishings are modern and chic, feels like a fashionable boutique hotel. Lastly, check in was fast and the bell boy at the step area as well as the staff by the name of Max, hard working and cheerful fellow. Now on what shouldn't go wrong in any hotels, the front desk lady call Monica was aloof and serves with a bad attitude. No greetings, no smiles from her while doing our check in although I politely said good morning and thanked her. Prior to us, she was friendly towards some Italian/European couple but when it came to our turn, her attitude took a drastic turn. Which make me wonder is she being a racist? (we are an Asian couple). She needs to be properly educated on impartial hospitality. Else she might be better off in the kitchen where no guests would see her if she doesn't like serving people with diversity. Other than the little unhappiness upon check in, I'll say it's quite a pleasant stay but would I come back again? Probably not. Note: as there is a bar in the hotel, it can get noisy for guests staying on lower floors. Music was really loud. So not recommended to those with children or light sleepers.

The hotel is nice and clean, the room was very spacious, but... the staff was very unfriendly and unprofessional. Their check-in time is 2 pm, but they couldn't check us in at 2:15 pm because the room wasn't ready, and they didn't even feel like apologizing for the wait (45 minutes). When I pointed at their check-in time, the answer was short - ""FROM 2 pm!"", which tells me it's a regular practice if they are so quick to answer. Our other questions were not answered so fast. When I asked about the laundry service I got 2 people telling me wrong information, and only the third staff person told us how the service actually work.

I would imagine lower floors may hear road noise. Rooms serviced well. Arrival goodies and birthday treats were welcomed, Thankyou. Breakfast was a fine selection of breads, pastries, meats, cheeses, cereals, fruit and cooked items. Must give a special mention to Fabrizio and Ewa running the bar. Incredibly friendly and passionate about their cocktails. If you like Aperol, ask Fabrizio for a P31 Spritz - you won’t be disappointed. Pre-arrival communications were good too and I must thank Laura for this. Ohio the doorman always had a smile and a cheery word. Let the hotel order you a taxi - you receive a slip with the taxi number on and it arrives in seconds (Uber are more expensive in Milan). WiFi superb even in the room.

1247,"Hotel NYX was a good find, practically next door to the station so brilliant if you need a base to explore from. The staff were friendly, attentive and check in was smooth and swift. Rooms were functional, nothing special or memorable (apart from a game of 'hunt the light switch' in order to turn the many illuminations off for the evening) The bed was comfortable, the pillows on the flat side - we're not talking luxury by any stretch. Bathroom was clean but tired, and needed some attention as the rustic look wasn't intentional. I did find it amusing that there was no internal shower door handle so it was impossible to close it flush and avoid water spraying out onto the floor. The extra touches elsewhere overshadow these small niggles though - the free mini-buffet in the bar, the free photobooth and the hearty and plentiful breakfast.

The “Corso Buenos Aires״ street is 15 min walk from the hotel so if you would like to combine shopping it is also very easy.Bottom line we loved it - I would definitely stay here again when coming back to Milano.

When we reserved the room, we said it’ll be the 3 of us (2 adults & 1 child); and when we got to the hotel, not only we got a big room, there were also 3 of everything. Towels, mugs, slippers, bathrobes and the sofa bed already converted to bed. Love how the hotel make traveling feel so easy. The location is perfect, only 2 minutes walk from Centralle station. Easy to get around town as subway is there also. The art pieces throughout the hotel are amazing. And there are also few arcades in the lobby level where my son had fun playing during the 3 nights stay. ","December 30, 2018","23    NYX Hotel Milan

1260,"First of all if you’re traveling to Milan via train, do yourself a favor and stay here. It’s literally a 3 min. Walk from Central train station. Pros~~LocationReception is very friendly, attentive, and ready to help. For November I thought the price was fair. Internet is fast and doesn’t randomly log you out. Breakfast is alright. Very modern and quirky design. We stayed on the 6th floor and it was relatively quiet. I liked that the bathroom had a regular door which is perfect if you’re staying here with a friend; you have some privacy. The hotel bar is really cozy, very creative cocktail choices- only caveat last call is at 2:00am on a Sat. Cons- - -It doesn’t have a practical entrance; you have to go upstairs to enter> not the best architectural concept since most people travel with luggage, or some may need special assistance.

The NYX Hotel would have had an excellent rating but were seriously let down by housekeeping. There would need to be major improvements in housekeeping for this hotel to be one of the best hotels to visit. Staff were friendly and helpful during our visit. We also used the Hotel Restaurant for all three nights of our stay. It was so good, affordable, food and wine were of a high level and the waitress who served us on all three nights was excellent.

The shuttle goes to the Milan Centrale station which is opposite the hotel. Look to the right and there is a huge little sign saying NYX. There are a few steps to get into the hotel but luckily there are porters who will carry up your luggage for you. Checkin was super speedy. then we where able to get to our room. it was perfect, tea , coffee plenty of towels and complimentary toiletries. Wonderful shower.

1281,"Overall, I’d recommend to stay here - it’s clean, modern, helpful staff and has comfy beds. When we arrived we had a large heavy luggage and there are only stairs to get into the hotel! No slope whatsoever to get the luggage up and no one to help us. We had to drag a heavy case up stairs to even get in. The entrance is also an entrance to other buildings so is in a very random place, it’s not very luxurious. When you enter the reception you can feel it’s not Hyatt quality. The decor and the darkness all look a little tacky/dated. The check in staff were lovely! Even printed one of my online tickets for me which I’m very grateful for. Breakfast was good, good amount of choice but slightly tasteless hot options. The room was very small! I couldn’t even open my suitcase anywhere - no where to keep and open the luggage. Couldn’t even open my case out on the floor because then you can’t walk. The blinds are super noisy and slow. Bathroom was clean and modern - no complaints there! There was a kettle too. The bed was comfy and everything was fairly clean. The corridor is so dark!!! Can barely see anything - slightly eerie. Lift is extremely slow! No help with bags unless you ask but the bellboy does not have a trolley so just manually picks them up and takes your cases down the stairs. The carpet and the tiles on the staircase are really poor design and a little tacky, completely takes away from the glamour a Hyatt should have. Turns out it’s only been a Hyatt from early May 2019. 8 min walk from the station which is easy to navigate but not easy with a large case. Close to tram stop too! Supermarket and shops available in the station for amenities. We enjoyed our stay but felt this hotel could up their standards a little to be a Hyatt.","June 9, 2019","24    Hyatt Centric Milan Centrale

1283,"After 3 years we came back to stay at this hotel again for a few days. This time we added breakfast, which we really enjoyed. It's a decent range of good quality food, fresh fruit and things like cappuccino can be ordered at no extra charge.The rooms are in the same style as on our first visit before the hotel rebranded to ""Hyatt"" – it's all modern and high quality. The room was very clean, although at one point a long hair fell out of the towels.Their information booklet in the room says you can borrow all sorts of things at the reception for the stay, including travel adapters and phone chargers, however when we asked for a USB phone charger, they didn't have any.Room service is a bit odd in this hotel. Although the room was made up nicely every day, sometimes they only took away the smaller towels without replacing them with new ones. We didn't even throw them on the floor. Either leave them where they are or replace them. There was only one spare role of toilet paper in the bathroom, but once we started using it, they never added another one for the rest of our stay, so it was not an oversight. I would expect a tiny bit more care in a hotel like this.","June 4, 2019","24    Hyatt Centric Milan Centrale

1285,"When we booked the hotel, it was part of Sofitel, now it's part of Hyatt. The hotel is a 5' walk from Central Station, and you can get there using one of the many shuttles (EUR 8) from the airport. It is also 2 blocks from the Lanza subway (M2) and a 5' to Central Station subway (M3) and many buses and trams.The room was big, with a nice updated bathroom, with the usual room amenities (refrigerator, toiletries, coffee and tea, water, space for luggage, flat screen TV, etc.). There was a comfortable sofa chair, a chair with wheels (likely to use it for work) and an ottoman. The wi-fi, hot water, AC were good. The room was somewhat dark and the choice of dark colors for furniture, closets, decorations, etc. doesn't help either. There are a lot of buttons by your nightstand to control the lights and the curtains; which took time to learn (I hit the button to turn-off the light and the curtains went up). The desk is very much occupied by lamps, coffee and tea making tray, etc. Not a desk to work comfortably.There is a gym room, with a bike, a treadmill and an elliptical machine. some free weights. Decent. Big Service issue: The bathroom started to have a (sewer) smell after 3 days, we reported this immediately. We were told it was a pipe problem that supposedly, was fixed two days after reported. However, the smell came back the next day. The solution of the problem on day 6? The windows were open! Also, a staff member offered on day 4 to spray to improve the smell. We should have been offered to change the room, something that never happened. Small service issues: We had to ask for more hangers, since there were only 5 in room (usually, there are more, especially if the the hotel knows it's a long stay). After day 5, the toiletries were not fully restocked, same for complimentary water (we had to ask for it).Breakfast was fine, with a good selection, but the selection is always the same. I stayed for 5 days and wife for 8 days, after 3-4 days, you get tired of eating the same. If you want a cappuccino or a latte you have to ask a member of the staff members working the room. By the way, the never asked us if we wanted something during breakfast. We learned we could order an espresso when we saw somebody ordering one. Strange, but it reflects a lack of service.Overall, for a 4 star hotel, there were too many issues, mainly related to poor or lack of service. In addition, the pipe problem, was never fully resolved.

The staff were professional and did what they're there to do but it seemed to be lacking a bit of personality. No room service and fairly average tea and coffee making facilities. It just felt like the right boxes has been ticked to get the four star rating, but it didn't feel like a 4 star.

The staff was helpful and accommodating as I became familiar with the many switches in the room. Yes, the hallways are dark...the neon room numbers are cool though.I stayed in a junior spa suit.

Then the room as we walked in we turned the lights on they didn’t work so we called reception they sent someone to fix it and we went out for a bit, when we returned to our room later on we wanted to see and use the spa at the cost of €15 per person per use we paid a lot of money for the room you would of thought it would of been free for guests. We left the aircon on the coldest setting until we returned to our room when we got back it was boiling and blowing out hot air so hot in fact we had to stay in the hallway for cool air again had to get it fixed. At check out we told the lady about our problems and she refunded us our mini bar and spa usage even so I think with the money the room cost plus the service you expect from the Hyatt chain these problems should happen in the first place.

1292,"The hotel itself is nice and the room has been spacious but from a technical perspective the setup is too complicated given that the building is rather new. There are around 10 buttons to serve the light (even with a printed menu on what each button does). Also for the remote control, the TV usage wasn‘t intuitively (therefore another instruction was printed to explain it to the guests). There are around 200 Italian channels but only around 5 international news channels in English language. Not really good enough for an international hotel chain. Given that we have reached the digital age, it would be not too much of an ask to support at least HDMI access or a smart TV to overcome this problem","April 22, 2019","24    Hyatt Centric Milan Centrale

A little further out from the centre of town but it depends on what you are doing with your days. A special shout out to Annalisa at breakfast service this lovely lady went out of her way to make our breakfast special Bringing us a special treat.

I chose this hotel because of SOFITEL Accor membership but understood it was a big mistake the moment I entered the hotel and saw the ground floor rooms like dark prison cell they offered me. It has nothing to relate to first class Accor hospitality nor Sofitel service. After such disappointment I regretfully booked at another hotel despite prepaid room at the Lagare hotel.

1299,"My impression of the hotel: Slightly rude service, nothing works and everything costs extra.Lighting, curtains and the disco-esque color-changing LED-light in the window were controlled by a panel in the room, which was clearly of Italian design. 16 buttons, and no indication of what would happen when pushing each of the buttons. Extremely frustrating! I also do not understand why I would want to adjust the toilet lighting from the bedside?The electronic curtains were very loud when being lowered/raised. I could hear when my next door neighbors woke up due to the noise of their curtains being lifted.I asked for an iron for my shirt, but they had none. I could have my shirt ironed by their service during some specific hours... for an extra charge obviously. If you make up rules of an iron being not allowed in the room, you should at least provide one in a common ironing room etc.The hotel building is very tall, but there are only 2 ""Italian style"" extremely slow elevators. Every trip to the lobby took 3-4 minutes due to this.Breakfast was mediocre at best. Everything looked like it had been on the table for a bit too long. Regardless of paying for a breakfast during booking, an omelette from the kitchen cost 8€ extra. This seems weird considering the price range.The hotel had a spa, which as I understand consisted of a sauna and lounge chairs. The price was not included in the hotel stay, and was around 16 €. Seems like a total ripoff.","January 28, 2019","24    Hyatt Centric Milan Centrale

1301,"I'm frequent traveller and Accor addicted since years, so I always choose Accor hotels around the world. Normally I rate 5 stars for every Sofitel and/or McGallery structure, but for LaGare in Milan was not the case. When I made the reservation I asked for an early check-in and I didn't get; I also asked for a Nespresso machine in the room and I didn't get. I would have expected to know that upfront (maybe by email or call) instead of realizing when I arrived.

1302,"The hotel is close to Central Station, and you can get there from Malpensa airport by the train service (which is often unreliable, sadly). It is also close to subway station.When you arrive, a huge stair is waiting for you in front of the hotel. They have someone to help you with bags, but if there are a lot of people upstairs and down, you would have to wait for a while for your turn.The biggest problem here are the elevators, as they have huge number of rooms and only two elevators. You would wait for ages on the morning before elevator will arrive, a huge planning oversights.Breakfast is nice, but selection stays the same, and it is rather modest. I stayed for 5 nights and I could not see those same dishes anymore. They also reuse yesterday's pastry, which is an embarrassment for a 4-star hotel. Breakfast room is very small and it is packed with tables, very hard to walk around without a risk of bumping into somebody. And it is unpleasant to eat here with people constantly hovering over you.Also, they do not provide irons to the rooms, you have to use their service, and I did not see anything like this in my entire travel experience.","December 28, 2018","24    Hyatt Centric Milan Centrale

Waiting staff were impeccable.I was on a business group booking so the menu for the evening meal was limited - should not have been a problem. First evening. Ravioli pretty al dente but filling was nice. Turbot was overcooked to jelly - what a crime!Second evening. Pasta so al dente it was barely cooked - inedible. Pork fillet served with a bloody, raw centre - a risk to health and not touched. No offer of any alternatives. Went to bed hungry.Reception staff excellent.

Nevertheless, the hotel is in an ideal location, only a short 10 minute walk from Milano Centrale train station which is great if you plan to spend a lot of time exploring main city centre of Milan (Duomo, Galleria Vittorio etc). Trains to Lake Como also depart from this station. Hotel itself is stylish and typically designed to accommodate guests on business trips. Reception staff were all very friendly and welcoming. However, do not get your hopes up for an early check-in time, we experienced a lot of people waiting around the main lobby area (including us) right up until the 2pm check-in time. We found the rooms to be extremely dark and a real challenge to get ready in the morning! Housekeeping was also very hit and miss over our 3 night stay. We found our towels and tea bags had not been replaced as well as items being put away in places where we could not find them. Also the shower handle broke mid-way through taking a shower. The rooftop terrace was very buzzing and a nice addition to the hotel.The location and proximity to the city centre, Linate airport & Como made up for these few faults.","October 18, 2018","24    Hyatt Centric Milan Centrale

We were here for the Formula 1 weekend and it was quite convenient to head to Monza from the hotel.They have a nice cozy lobby with a small restaurant which has a very nice outside terrace.

Was not overly impressed, but what upset me the most was that the staff lied about their reason for a lack of an iron in the room and their inability to provide me with one. I was told that Italian law dictated that it was not possible. I previously lived in Italy for 2 years, have stayed in numerous hotels across the peninsula, and this was the first time I learned about this ""law"". The following week, I stayed in Venice for a conference and there my hotel provided me with this basic feature upon my request, without issue. If the hotel does not trust their guests to use an iron, that is one thing, but they should not use Italian bureaucracy as a scapegoat... Because of this, and do to their lack of cares given, I would not recommend staying at this venue for work-related functions.","August 1, 2018","24    Hyatt Centric Milan Centrale

1330,"This was our second visit to the Hotel Principe di Savoia, conveniently located at the Piazza della Repubblica. It is about a 30 minute walk to the central area of Milan where you'll find the shopping district, the Duomo and the famous Galleria Emanuele ""shopping mall"" which is actually an enclosed facility loaded with shops and restaurants. The hotel itself is absolutely top notch, a feeling you get as soon as you walk through the front door where you're greeted by the reception staff. The check-in process is a breeze. The rooms are large by European standards, even the Classic Room. Free wifi, room safe, full complement of bathroom amenities and a large HD-TV. Beyond the room itself, a very courteous and helpful concierge staff. A formal restaurant is available in a separate room near the reception with a ""lighter fare"" area immediately off the reception area for those who want a simpler option. This hotel is excellent in every respect...the value is definitely commensurate with the room rates. Highly recommended by us...","June 12, 2019","25    Hotel Principe Di Savoia

Luxurious, beautiful building and lobby, rooms were comfortable and we were upgraded so quite a large room with high ceilings. Traditional beautiful furnishing appropriate for the style. Staff were friendly, attentive and most importantly efficient. They were quick and happy to accommodate any requests. I used room service a lot and appreciate their efforts in customizing my orders. My guest arrived earlier before I did and before check in time...the reception staff were very accommodating in allowing him to check in ahead and asked for his room preference, which was greatly appreciated.Overall a wonderful hotel in a great location with friendly staff.

1347,"Love, love, loved this hotel. Aside from the gorgeous room that we were upgraded to due to our American Express Platinum Card, and the lovely location and free shuttle to the touristic part of Milan, the staff are in large part why I am writing this review. When we first arrived it was early, and, having been to Europe at least 30 times, we are used to the fact that the room will not be ready. This is the first time, however, that we were told they would try to make the room ready for us asap and they actually did it!!! The young lady at the front desk could not have been nicer or more welcoming--which is fabulous after a long overnight flight. While we were waiting, we were invited to go up to a lovely 7th floor outdoor patio where we were served with coffee and pastries and told to relax until the room was ready. It was a beautiful day and within an hour, we were ushered into a fabulous room with a gorgeous bathroom and separate area for luggage, etc. One of the best arrivals in Europe we have ever experienced. For the remainder of our 3 night/4 day stay, we were pampered and treated like royalty by the front desk staff, concierges (who are tremendous), maids, bar staff, etc. The level of service we received here was second to none. The happy hour in the main bar is lovely with a wide variety of h'ors d'ouevres and a great way to start an evening out.. I would return to Milan just to stay at this hotel.

1348,"Asked specifically for a quiet room and ended up across from a room in the 8th or 7th floor with a constant barking dark who had clueless inconsiderate owners. Also we could hear at night the constant thumping of a neighboring disco club. The barking dog was more annoying than anything, and we were knackered, but could not sleep because of it. Hoteliers could do nothing about this, except when the guests came back (2 clueless women) the hotel moved them elsewhere, thank goodness. We received champagne as a consolation, which was nice, except we generally do not drink alcohol. Also, walking around Milan was disappointing - not quite the glamorous city we expected to see. Vomit and dog feces galore on the sidewalks. But hey, people obviously like it here. You can hear conversation just outside the room, so sound proofing is lacking.","October 25, 2018","25    Hotel Principe Di Savoia

Unfortunately, our room faced air vents to the subway, and the periodic rumbling went well into the night and started again early in the morning. This was not controlled by the double paning and we were on the sixth floor. Needless to say, the sleep quality was not what was expected from a luxury hotel.

The equipment needs real change, while instructors are very polite, they spend their time reading newspapers, waiting to train someone from time to time. It's a real pity, and a waste of a really beautiful space. A couple of Peloton bikes, and the latest equipment, and for instructors to make sure that clients know how to use new equipment, will be real added value to the Hotel.

1367,"I stayed at this hotel at the end of my three weeks in Italy and my stay here was just as I had expected. Excellent customer service, with extremely helpful staff. Pool and spa facilities were good, free limousine ride to town centre is a nice touch, room very comfortable and clean. Didn’t eat breakfast here as there are lots of cafes close by that are not as expensive, if you like cats the Crazy cat cafe is a must! The only negative was the shower in the small old fashioned bath, the water pressure was low and kept going cold. This was reported and didn’t spoil my stay. 200 Euros for a private car to the airport, 90 Euros in a taxi or a five minute walk to the train station and a ticket costing 13 Euros. I know which one I chose. ","August 2, 2018","25    Hotel Principe Di Savoia

1368,"After over twenty years I stay in this hotel I truly consider it the best in Milan, I do love others like il Grand Hotel de milan or the Four Seasons, but price wise the Principe di Savoia is unbeatable. Dorchester collection remains one of our family choices, whether at Coworth Park where we often stay or Principe, the quality of rooms, linen, size and general atmosphere is amongst the best you can find in the world.

1369,"When the Principe Di Savoia was first recommended I hesitated because I knew there was a Four Seasons in Milan and that is usually my go to hotel. Well I absolutely made the right choice in booking the Principe! It is an exquisite hotel with very spacious rooms and customer service of the highest standard. When we arrived, we were greatly as if we were regulars with news that our room had been upgraded. The room was ready even though is was only 1pm. We quickly unpacked and went to the restaurant for lunch and again, received a wonderful greeting and a great table in the garden. When the people at the next table began to smoke (a big problem with outdoor tables in Italy) we asked for an indoor table. Our waiter quickly arranged an indoor table with a view of the garden. The food was delicious and looked as good as it tasted. The breakfast buffet was outstanding each morning of our stay and the waiters knew our coffee and tea orders after our first day and had it ready for us as we were being seated. I needed some assistance with a medicine that needed refrigeration and the hotel staff quickly and efficiently came to my aid. The bellman at the front door each evening was outstanding, getting us taxis, recommending walks, providing a map of the shopping and again, knew our names after the first afternoon! This is a quality hotel with truly amazing service. I recommend it highly.","July 19, 2018","25    Hotel Principe Di Savoia

1372,"I have stayed at the Principe di Savoia more than 25 times and will undoubtedly continue to do so every time I go to Milan. It's just home to me. And a very comfortable and luxurious one!My favourite thing: the staff. Even though everything in the hotel is superb, the friendliness of the staff is simply outstanding. I feel very well taken care of whenever I'm there and they make sure to express it. They know perfectly well which room I like and will go out of their way to put me in it every single time.The food is amazing; from room service to the huge buffet breakfast, I love it all. And I simply love to sit at the lobby lounge while I work and enjoy a cappuccino, seasonal afternoon treats and of course, some great aperitivo. Again, the staff is always super welcoming and looking out for any needs I may have all the time.Rooms are all beautifully decorated (think classic, old-school luxury hotel) with all the modern amenities you may need (great TV) and I have never seen one that's not super spacious. And believe me, I've seen a lot of them.For my nights in, nothing beats trip to the gym, a visit to the pool and to finish it all, a great massage at the spa.Location is very good as well, a short walk to the Milano Centrale and a very pleasant stroll to the downtown/Duomo area.What can I say? This hotel has converted me into a forever loyal Principe di Savoia guest!","July 8, 2018","25    Hotel Principe Di Savoia

1373,"i stayed at the Principle di Savoia for 2 nights for business. The hotel looks like a grand dame, steeped in history and elegance. It's located close to the business district but within walking distance (20 mins) to the Duomo. The sign of a good hotel is the strength of its concierge service and here the hotel really shines. All of my questions and requests professionally and kindly managed. The front desk was good but not quite as user friendly....a mistake on my final bill was eventually corrected but without as much as a simple 'sorry'. Pity, because I was overcharged twice during my stay (I was also charged at the hotel bar for a bottle of wine instead of a glass).My room was lovely, with a convenient hallway that ensured that I couldn't hear any hallway noise. The beds were ok - a bit hard for my taste - but otherwise fine. The tv had a few nice sports and english language channels. The bathrooms come with great products (Aqua di Parma). The shower is fine but not as nice as other 5 star hotels. There is a gym which is very nicely equipped compared to other hotel gyms. It even includes a small indoor pool. Finally, the restaurant downstairs is good - the breakfast buffet is nice although the selection is not as elaborate as some. Overall, despite a few small niggles, I enjoyed my staff and would certainly return.","July 7, 2018","25    Hotel Principe Di Savoia

1376,"I visited Milan for four days on a mix of business and pleasure and although the hotel was absolutely wonderful I found Milan a real let down. The hotel was incredible, friendly staff who were all very helpful. Lovely large, clean rooms with plenty of space and big powerful showers. Unfortunately whilst in Milan we were mugged twice and I would warn any visitor to be very careful when walking around the centre. One of the most annoying experiences was at the castle where there seem to be hundreds of African guys forcibly trying to place a piece of ""lucky"" string on your wrist and then charge you for it. We politely said no ten or eleven times but they just became aggressive and pushy, luckily the local police where nearby and we were able to call them over. Very unpleasant experience. I couldn't recommend the hotel enough but I won't be visiting Milan again. Another thing to watch out for is the taxi drivers, they are all ready to exploit the hell out of you. We asked the price for a taxi from the airport to our hotel and three taxi drivers told us 70 Euro, I told them I would just try Uber which they tried to put me off, they told me no Uber would collect from the airport.…. 5 minutes later a brand new Audi Q7 Uber turned up and it cost us 19 Euro to get to the hotel. We used Uber everywhere and were amazed at both how cheap they were and what incredible cars they all drove!","July 2, 2018","25    Hotel Principe Di Savoia

Just amazing, located on the tenth floor with a spectacular view of the new city skyscrapers. Breakfast service was most friendly and professional, with all you would expect from this class of hotel. Beware, however, of any food or drink extras as these are eye wateringly expensive. €20 for an omelette.

The staff were very helpful with anything you needed. I had a superior double room which was a great size and had everything that I needed. The bed was a good size and was comfortable but the pillows not so much. The bathroom was a big size which had a big bath with a shower, lots of essential toiletries (which included conditioner which is good as not many hotels include this) a bath robe and slippers two sinks and plenty of space. The storage space was good as well as having the safe as this is key. I think for the room it would have been good to have more lighting as I felt the room was always dark even in the mornings. Breakfast was included and this was very good with lots of variety. Hot drinks were served to you which was nice. There was lots of choice and the yoghurts were great!

However, today, we are not going to review the hotel, the location and the staff (which is quite obvious that we like, by always choosing to stay here). We would like to share something of o major importance. That is, during breakfast, we saw a guy who was serving us. He was extremely polite, with a smiling face, very quick at his duties. However, there was something uncommon about him. When we asked his colleagues about him, we were told that he was ""transitioning"" and that, even though he was in the middle of the process, everybody respected HER true nature, by admiring and supporting the choice made. This is just amazing! This is the true purpose of a hotel, where everyone is welcomed and accepted for what he/she is, no matter what religion, race, skin, color or gender, that do not really matter. What really matters are, humanity, politeness, acceptance and respect for one's path. Many compliments on this! The whole world should be and act that way.

1390,"We lucked out getting a room on the seventh floor with a jacuzzi tub at Hotel Milano Scala. We had ordered a superior double, but I think it helped that we arrived just about check in time at 2:00 PM. The hotel had a great location at the edge of the Brera on Via Dell'Orso, close to the Duomo and La Scala Opera House, the arcade of Vittorio Emanuele and near the fashion quadrilateral. We wished we had had more time to explore the area, but we only stayed two nights before a flight on our way home from Malpensa. We had good meals at L'Osteria di Brera and Obica. Even at these restaurants, a plate of pasta was only about 10 Euros. (Manhattan has an Obica, but everything costs fifty percent more.) There is generally a cover charge at the restaurants for each person of two or three Euros, but you can consider this as a component of a tip. A new Starbucks that was said to be the biggest one in the world had just opened up on Via Cordusio. The room itself was a reasonable size, and the bed was very comfortable. Everything was pretty high tech. There was a large patio looking out over the city, and steps outdoors leading down to terraces with a rooftop vegetable garden for the hotel restaurant and an outdoor bar. The hotel staff were very professional and helpful. The hotel provides an iphone device with mapping software, so you shouldn't get lost in the city.

Our long flight from Australia arrived quite early in the morning and the lovely reception staff settled us into the Libary with coffee while our room was prepared so we could check in early. Our room was very comfortable, clean and nicely designed, and the breakfasts were very nice - but the real highlight was the staff - the front desk staff were very helpful and friendly (Yolanda, Andrea and Simone all looked after us with good humour!) and the breakfast room staff were also friendly and looked after us well, as did the porters. We were very taken with the morning music performances - you don't expect a live performance by a classical musician while you are having a hotel breakfast! We particularly enjoyed that (we heard harp, classical guitar and harpsicord), a very nice touch. The hotel was really well located for what we wanted to do - a very short walk to the Brera Art Gallery and all the Brera outdoor restaurants; also very close to the Duomo, the Museo Poldi Pezzoli, and the Ambrosiana Art Gallery too, and of course the Galleria.

Iron and ironing board available on request. City tax is €5 per person, per night. Payable when you check out. A bit noisy from the street, but only really noticed it in the morning.

1446,"Stayed 4 nights. Location is excellent. It’s just about 200m from Via Buenos Aires. Also about 10-15 minute walk from la Stazione Centrale Milano.Breakfast in this hotel is fabulous! The selection is wide and quality very good.Staff are friendly and helpful.The room we booked was a Superior double. Be aware that these rooms have a deep bath with no ‘stand up’ shower; this means that the shower rose/shower head is attached to the wall, not far above the bath. One must sit in the bath and duck head under shower rose to wash your hair.You can detach the rose and stand up BUT it’s difficult to wash with only one available hand while holding shower with the other. You can of course ask your partner to stand and hold the shower rose above your head whilst you wash.Or, select a different room style.Room size was fine, with good wardrobe space and the bed was comfy.Afternoons the bar is open for drinks in the courtyard area - very pleasant.","May 25, 2019","27    Hotel Sanpi Milano

1450,"This nice hotel is situated between the city centre and the central station. Although the walk to the city centre is a little longer it can be done part way through a very nice park. Tram route 1 also runs by outside so you can catch that into the centre if you want. We found the staff very friendly and pleasant and our room, being a corner room was very spacious with a very smart large sized bathroom. The breakfast is very good with cold continental and some hot food can also be found. (Bacon and eggs for all us Brits!) More specific hot foods can be ordered at a price. It's kind of a boutique sort of hotel and I'm not sure it works all through the building. Certainly downstairs in the foyer and the eating areas it does but not so much upstairs where it looks a little tired. The only thing that vexed us in anyway was the lift we had to use each morning that was very reluctant to come up to our 2nd floor no matter how many times we requested it! It seemed to hover around -1 to the first floor. One morning we got so tired of waiting (despite requesting it several times) we used the adjacent fire escape stairs that were open. This though was our only real quibble.","May 19, 2019","27    Hotel Sanpi Milano

1452,"My husband and I stayed in a superior room for 3 nights in May and our stay was wonderful Main points:Room was spacious and light - fantastic bathroom amenities No noise from other guests and minimal noise from outside Breakfast was continental - plenty bread, spreads, cereals and fruit Bar service at night was always prompt and served with a smile and polite chat Their garden (although not warm enough for us to sit out in the morning) was lit by fairy light at night, very romantic! There are even blankets by the door so you can stay out longer and be wrapped up. Hotel is a 10-15 min walk from centrale station and there are metros are either end of the street so super handy!! There are also tram stops a few minutes walk away Reception keep your key when you go out which I think is a huge bonus personally, the keys are quite chunky so less to carry plus less chance of losing said key! Tourist tax for us was €5 per person per day and we paid on check out, super easy.

Located central walking distance between the station & the Duomo. We were greeted in a friendly manor and check in was easy & straightforward. Our luggage was taken to our room on the first floor. Room was clean and spacious with a nice shower, tea/coffee making facilities & a comfortable bed. Breakfast here is absolutely fantastic - a great selection of cereal, fruits, eggs, cold/hot meats, pastries & cakes. But the real credit to this hotel is the helpfulness of the staff. Upon moving on to visit another part of Italy we realised we had left behind a highly important valued item & called hotel Sanpi to ask if this had been found. Daniele went completely above and beyond and was the most helpful & considerate hotel employee we have ever dealt with. Luckily housekeeping had located the item & Daniele ensured that this was kept safe for us at reception for when we were able to return a couple of days later to pick up. We are forever grateful to this hotel for their kind help & would certainly stay here again when we return to the city. Highly recommended!!","May 9, 2019","27    Hotel Sanpi Milano

The Metro had a station close by the hotel, for those for whom walking may not be convenient.The hotel had a unique, modern style and the staff were impeccably professional, whilst remaining very warm and friendly.Our room was comfortable, stylish and well appointed and we enjoyed sleeping in comfortable beds with good quality linen.Breakfast was a real highlight, with an excellent choice of commestibles of the best quality. The Italian pastries were particularly delectable.The neighbourhood had a number of restaraunts offering a range of cuisines as well as pleasant, stylish bars.The area was quiet and peaceful and yet within easy reach of the centre of the city.We really enjoyed our stay and if visiting Milan in the future we would not hesitate to return to the Hotel Sanpi.Thank you to all the very pleasant and very professional staff.

1495,"The Hotel Sanpi, Milano can't be faulted for their level of service or the fantastic nature of their staff. Location had everything, which included a short walk to restaurants, one of the main parks in Milan and shopping districts. The gorilla bar and garden at night provided a wonderful atmosphere to end a day in Milan. The wonderful Christian (the bartender) provided a high end of service that couldn't be faulted , the level of welcome from him was that you just wanted to stay that much longer in the lounge and garden. Breakfast was had a good variety of food to partake in before starting the day.The faults were that on Saturday Night there was a local nightclub that was making enough noise to keep us awake. We had a ground floor room whose shower had this issue whereby it kept flooding the rest of the bathroom because it couldn't drain fast enough. A lot of towels and bathmats would prevent it reaching the carpet outside but it was disconcerting.These two things aside, we would have no hesitation in returning to the Hotel Sanpi. Also they served one of the best Chardonnays that we ordered on holiday.","November 19, 2018","27    Hotel Sanpi Milano

Also had a view of the indoor garden which made it even better.I stayed in Milan for six days and did not tire of the breakfast as it had a vast choice of food such as scrambled and hard- boiled eggs, ham, brie and other sorts of cheeses, juices, pastries, croissants and lots of fruit. I loved the fact that greens were served with artichokes and cherry tomatoes. Not always easy to stick to a balanced diet while a tourist so the greens were a great addition to breakfast. You can ask for cappucino if you do not want to use the coffee machine. The setting was very pretty and staff helpful.Was within walking distance of two subways and when I had to pick up dinner, there were lots of places to choose from, close the hotel.

1503,"I was lured to this hotel by the decent reviews it got on TripAdvisor and the relatively good value it projected. Looking at its website I saw a good offer from an international credit card company which sounded promising. Upon arrival the promises started disappearing. We were warmly greeted at the reception desk and told we got a courtesy ""upgrade"" to a superior room. Upon entering the slow elevator we were lifted into a hall reminiscent of a 1980's discotheque, complete with faux LED stars a bright shiny gold dusted floor and blueish modernist/impressionist stucco. Very kitschy. Our room was very small and quirky as is the whole hotel. It had the same decor as the hallway complete with a Gustave Klimt replica. The bathroom was also small and awkward, All with a useless vaulted ceiling to make up for the missing horizontal space. The tub was fit for a pole vaulter or a high jumper and is an open risk of severe injury as it is set about 2-3 feet from the floor (no kidding!). You need to be tall and fit to enter it. There is no shower but a hand held contrivance which makes it all but impossible to take a full body cleanup. Dangerous to say the least. That should be changed to avoid a fatality. And that was not the worse part. The room was almost at street level in a street which has many a late night watering holes for national communities. It gets loud past midnight and up to 3am. So be ready to handle some noise and rowdiness. To make things worse, the outdated telephone system does not work properly and we were unable to call in for a wake up call.The rest of the hotel is awkwardly designed as it seems to be a collection of joined buildings. The lobby is not ample but consists of several nooks. Enough said about the unpleasant part of the stay. I would like to point out the Sanpi's saving graces too.The staff is nice. Breakfast is abundant and good. Capuccino is outstanding during breakfast. The inner garden is pretty, peaceful and very quaint. The location is very good, close to the Repubblica Metro station and within walking distance of many attractions and great restaurants, including Via Buenos Aires and its shopping and entertainment.This property should not be advertised as a four star property though, but should be advertised as a three star property, which is what it really is.","October 8, 2018","27    Hotel Sanpi Milano

1504,"The location has to be a big plus for this hotel, close to several Metro stations, but not an unreasonable walk into the Duomo. The street the hotel is in appears a little 'dodgy', but we walked it day and night, even though often people 'hanging' around, it didn't feel unsafe. The breakfast was very good, and a plus was the lovely quiet garden, a small oasis, and very pretty at night with little lights. Have to agree the front desk staff seemed a little 'disinterested' and were not very helpful at all when asking directions or advice. I have marked it a 4, because I think it is value for money in a city that is pretty expensive to stay in - though the room we had, wasn't the best - I think 'generally' they are pretty good. Quite small, especially the bathroom - but that is fairly typical. We looked out to a wall, so the room was quite dark, but a few rooms along would have looked into the garden - the plus with this is that it was very quiet, though the street wasn't particularly busy with cars, there are a number of bars and restaurants. So I would tend to recommend a room looking out to the garden, but maybe pay a little more so you are not at the wall end, and maybe a bit higher up with more light. There was no ventilation, or natural light in our bathroom, with that and the air con, the room had a slight smell, not really bad, but notice it when you first come into the room. Another plus is the several laundry options close by, on the same street are several places that you can leave laundry to be done for you and ironed, and a few blocks away, there is a street to the right, where they have pay washer and dryer, 7 euros for a load.","October 7, 2018","27    Hotel Sanpi Milano

They don’t give out any recommendations and act like it’s a huge favor when you ask for anything. The clerk checking us out this morning (Sunday, 7 Oct) was the worst so far!

1511,"I absolutely LOVE this hotel! Here’s why:LOCATION Although it is within walking distance of Milan’s central train station, we were jet lagged, so decided to take a taxi — only €5.20. On our return trip, we walked.For our first day in Milan, we wanted to take it slow, so we appreciated that the hotel is only a few blocks from the Public Gardens. We spent the afternoon sitting in the park, trying to adjust to the time difference and lack of sleep. There are plenty of restaurants and bars in the general neighborhood. We particularly liked the Azzurra Grill.The red line metro is only a few blocks away. The third stop is the Duomo.SERVICEWhen we arrived around 11 AM, no rooms were available, however staff at reception suggested we leave our bags and relax in the lounge. About 15 minutes later, he was back with our key. Our bags had already been placed in the room.We left Milan for a couple of days, then returned. The hotel stored one of our bags until our return.All of the staff we encountered were helpful and welcomingROOMThe beds were comfortable; the room was clean and quiet.Breakfast was adequate, and you could order special items for a price.Room amenities included the usual shampoo, conditioner, plus a few unexpected extras like slippers and shoe cleaner.Towels were plentiful.There was a hair dryer. It was one of those that is attached to the wall. I brought my own, so didn’t use it.Water pressure was good.The room was air conditioned and the cooling system was not noisy.You can get light meals if you don’t want to go out for lunch or dinner.Overall, we were very pleased with our stay.

Sure, it’s not in the dead centre of the touristy areas, but why would you want to stay there? Those areas are often too crowded and annoying. This hotel is in a wonderful and interesting neighbourhood, so you can explore something really Milanese vs a touristy version. It’s safe, so you can easily walk to the Duomo, for example, or take public transportation or a taxi/rideshare. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay here, and I will do so again on my next trip toMilan.

1529,"The Viu Hotel MilanThis is a new hotel ,open a little more than a year, in a run down area next to Chinatown. There are great views of the Cemeteria where Toscanini is buried from the top floor bar. The view is currently unpleasant due to construction but eventually a park will cover what is now underground parking.A taxi to the Duomo or center runs 10 to 15 Euros . There is a tram stop but getting tickets for it can be quite difficult as the local stores that sell them are often closed! The hotel does not run a shuttle to town as does the Principe Savoia which is about the same distance from the center but on the North East side of town.The best part of the stay was the very attentive and gracious desk clerk, Clara who goes way out of her way to help her guests!The rooms are well appointed and well decorated in a very contemporary minimalistic style. There are plenty of outlets!There is an roof top pool and bar which is pleasant after a long day but the restaurant downstairs has no flavor and the service appears amateurish.There appear to be very few Italian restaurants of quality near by.It will be a while before this hotel is ready to be a first choice in its expensive price category.","June 19, 2019","28    Hotel VIU Milan

When asked we were told its now against the law to have an iron in a hotel room. However, it then cost me £67.00 to have my clothes ironed. I think the hotel should put this on their website as I visited Rome two years ago and it wasn't the law then, therefore I didn't think to check this out before visiting.

With only 12 sunbeds for 124 rooms, chances of getting one is very little. No shade on the rooftop except for 3 big umbrellas, covering 6 sunbeds. Extreme noise coming from 3 construction sites surrounding it , even on Saturdays. For a small pool (really small), way too many very young, screaming and splashing kids. I have no understanding way a stylish place with a nice, but tiny roof top accepts families with toddlers (300€ per night). I guess this will only be worse in July. Also, charging 35€ for breakfast under that circumstances is way over in my opinion.","June 1, 2019","28    Hotel VIU Milan

1548,"Located in Milan's chinatown, Hotel VIU's location might at first seem like an oddity for a luxury hotel – however, after spending three nights – we found the location perfect for Milan and would gladly return to the area.In terms of location, the hotel was approx. 3 km from the central station, with a taxi taking about 10 minutes for a cost of €10. Several trams ran nearby, with a metro station just a few minutes walk away. We found it generally took about 30 minutes to walk to the center, although the neighboring areas offered plenty of local places to eat and drink, and with transit, we could get almost anywhere in a short amount of time. When it was time to depart, we took a taxi to Linate airport for approx. €30.Arriving in the evening, check-in was friendly and efficient. Throughout our stay, the front desk was helpful and proactive, offering travel advice, providing transit tickets, and ultimately taking care of some of the small shortcomings we had with housekeeping.Our 4th floor King Deluxe room was modern and spacious, decorated in a modern and modest Italian manner. All of the standard amenities you would expect were present, including a Nespresso, large TV, and plenty of space to work. The bed was extra comfortable and we appreciated the general quality and condition of the room.The bathroom was large and well appointed with Malin+Goetz toiletries, although we were surprised to find no conditioner in our room. On our second day, after a couple of attempts, we were able to finally receive a double-sized container but were disappointed the next day when housekeeping removed it from our room after only having partially been used. In fact, it seemed to be the norm to simply throw away partially used toiletries and replace them, versus being more eco friendly and letting guests complete one set before moving on to the next.Housekeeping itself left us a bit flummoxed: while it was great to receive daily turn down service, personalized notes about weather, and delicious cookies, simple tasks such as replacing used Nespresso pods or tea bags, or tidying up cords, went undone.While we didn't have a chance to dine at the hotel, we were impressed by our welcome amenity of sweets and wine, as well as with the beautiful rooftop lounge. Views of Milan were available in all directions and the outdoor pool looked extremely enticing – even if it was the middle of winter.All in all we had a comfortable stay and would definitely consider returning if the price was right. The only downsides we really experienced was the inconsistent housekeeping which while forgivable, shouldn't be an issue at luxury hotel.","January 26, 2019","28    Hotel VIU Milan

1554,"Wonderful new building and the people could not have been nicer. We stayed 15 nights at the hotel and got to know most of the staff. On our first day we met Luigi and Laura at the reception desk. They turned out to be two of the nicest and most helpful people in Milan. Luigi upgraded our room on arrival and personally escorted us to the room explaining the hotel features to us along the way. The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was very clean and modern. Housekeeping did an excellent job everyday. We had a delicious dinner at the restaurant on the first night but decided to seek out other restaurants for the remainder of our stay. Breakfast buffet was spectacular at the rooftop restaurant/bar. Sofia was a wonderful hostess and made us feel right at home every morning. She even tried to teach me some Italian. We opted to do our sightseeing travel by taxi because the tram system was difficult to understand and we wanted to travel efficiently and not waste time waiting for tram and transfers. There was only about 2-5 mins waiting time for a taxi and 20 minutes for a tram. Taxi fees averaged 2-3 times tram fees. Traffic around the hotel was noisy as was the construction site across the street. Soon the construction on that side of the building will be finished. The other side has a large parking lot being constructed and is responsible for quite a bit of noise. With a crane still in place, it does not appear to be finishing any tome soon. Traffic and tram noise is pervasive throughout Milan, so other hotels are equally noisy.While the hotel is non-smoking, smoking is permitted in the outside garden and on the outside of the terrace. To us non-smokers this is an irritant that blows inside the restaurant. We did not try the Michelin-rated restaurant only because we need to eat earlier than 7pm.The best feature of the hotel is the friendly staff at Reception and Terrace . At both places everyone spoke English very well. They tried their best to be kind and helpful. Outstanding staff I recall are Luigi, Laura, Raffaella, Clara and Lucrezia. At the Terrace Buffet I commend Sofia and Alex for trying to make our stay as nice as possible. If it were not for the noise I would rate this hotel a 5 star. They are doing everything right and as soon as the construction stops it will be 5 star. BTW our weather in October was perfect, sunny everyday, about 75 degrees.","November 6, 2018","28    Hotel VIU Milan

The staff on reception are fantastic and make you feel very welcome, though we were only told about places to go in Milan as we were leaving and given a map then! The room itself we booked was good, spacious and comfy, although it overlooked a gigantic building site. Location isn’t very central, in the middle of Chinatown on the outskirts of the city, though it’s up and coming as a location maybe. Some downsides include the fact the shower pressure was pretty poor and that there was no iron in the room - we were told we had to pay for any ironing. Also breakfast wasn’t included in our rate and was quite expensive, I felt like seeing the roof terrace on my first morning and decided to get a coffee there - for €6! The pasticceria nearby was selling the same coffee for €1.50 We liked the room products, nice shower gel and shampoo, but for this price you’d expect some better extras, like a free ironing service or a nespresso machine in the room instead of just Nescafé sachets.

Just need to be mindful that the hotel is located near Chinatown which is a bit far away from the main shopping area in Milan (e.g. Brera, Duomo). So after dinner / shopping in the main area, it may not be too safe to walk back to the hotel even if it's just 30 mins walk - I took taxi every night which is obviously not that cheap in Milan.That said, still a highly recommended hotel - its lower price relative to other 5 stars hotels in Milan has very fairly reflected its relatively less convenient location.

1563,"At first we thought the hotel was a bit out of place as there was building works still going at the front(couldn’t hear anything) and not much else around, the tram stop is right outside and there is a nice area with bars/restaurants only a 2 minute walk away so plenty to do.Staff are friendly,rooms are plush and very clean as you’d expect.My only issue was a lack of an iron, we normally travel from place to place and pull out clothes each day as required, they offer an ironing service which would have cost us about €70 as we wanted 2 lots each as we wanted to go in the evening as it was our wedding anniversary, we didn’t go out that evening as I begrudge paying that for something we normally do in every hotel we’ve been to,free.Having said that, the hotel did notice it was our anniversary and we came back to find a bottle of Prosecco,chocolates and card left in the room for us.I would definitely stay here again but I’d make sure I brought a travel iron.","September 30, 2018","28    Hotel VIU Milan

Very beautiful bar and pool in the rooftop, with views to the city and the nearby Monumental Cemetery (one of Milan must see attractions).

1565,"ミラノのチャイナタウンにある新しいホテル。当然ですがお部屋は清潔でとても快適で、スタッフも親切で余計なストレスがありません。また、このホテルの特筆すべきポイントはプールとレストランです。プールは狭いですが、ルーフトップにあってとても気持ちが良い！朝から入れますので、出発ギリギリまでのんびりリフレッシュできました。ランニングが好きな方は、周辺を走ってからこのプールでクールダウンなんて最高です。このホテルに決めたら水着をお忘れなく。そしてレストランも良かった。そこまで多くメニューは無いですが、必要充分です。気になるところは、景色があまり良くない点と周辺環境です。隣が建設中なので景色は工事風景しか見れないのと、周辺は中華街で、市街地はやや遠いです。コルソコモまで徒歩10分で、私は散歩がてら全然歩きましたが、利便性の高い場所ではありません。それでもこのホテルは泊まる価値があると心から思いましたし、隣の工事が終わり、もう少し周辺エリアが活気づきそうなポテンシャルがあるので、このエリアのランドマークになる気がしてます。A new hotel in Chinatown, Milan. Naturally the room is clean and very comfortable. Staff is kind, there is no extra stress. Also, the most notable points of this hotel are the pool and the restaurant. Although the pool is narrow, it is very comfortable on the rooftop! Since I can enter from the morning, I was able to refresh leisurely until departure. If you like running, this pool is the best cool down place. Do not miss a bathing suit if you book this hotel. And the restaurant was also good. There are not many menus so far, but they are necessary enough.The point to worry about is that the scenery is not so good. Because the neighbor is under construction, the scenery can only see construction scenery. And the surrounding environment the neighborhood is Chinatown, the city area is a little far. It was a 10 minute walk to Corso Como, I took a walk and I walked at all, but it is not a convenience place. Still though I really thought that this hotel is worth staying, and since the next neighborhood construction is over and the potential area is a little more likely to be lively, I feel like to be a landmark in this area.","September 17, 2018","28    Hotel VIU Milan

1566,We stayed at Hotel VIU for one night on our Italian road trip. The hotel was very modern and clean. We received some wonderful treats from the hotel as it was my birthday and for staying with VIU which was a lovely touch. The hotel had a beautiful rooftop pool and bar which was a great place to relax after a day exploring the city. The hotel was a little far from the city centre however the metro is only a few minutes away.

Tram stop 20 yards from front door to take you into Milan centre / train station round the corner. Very good experience - slightly out of town but worth it. Things to watch out for - July 18 there is construction work going on in the area - there was no noise or disturbance but it wasn’t a pretty view from our room but that wasn’t an issue for our trip.We thoroughly loved this place and I’d have no heitation going back.Cleanliness was perfect and room size and comfort was exceptional.Thank you for a wonderful stay Hotel VIU.","August 29, 2018","28    Hotel VIU Milan

Just steps away from Chinatown, you’re sure to get your money’s worth. Hands down, the best service in town! The property also holds an amazing Michelin-star restaurant, a rooftop outdoor pool, and 2 bars that serve the best cocktails you’ll ever have. I highly recommend. It felt like home more than anything. Spacious rooms and really comfortable beds; you’ll have a hard time leaving. Certified as one of Milan’s best kept secrets.

Fantastic location in a very local neighbourhood which was nicely removed from the main tourist areas yet still very accessible - with some good restaurants and bars nearby. The pool is a nice touch though isn’t realistically used for much more than a backdrop for guests’ instagrammable pouting photos. Nice setting for breakfast though which has a good a la carte option.Rooms were fine - not blow away great but did the job and with comfy beds.Service was always very friendly and helpful.Overall a nice place to stay in a cool city.,"August 3, 2018","28    Hotel VIU Milan

1576,This hotel is nice and clean and we enjoyed the stay - but there are too many things...- rooms are fair priced but prices in the restaurant and the bar are outrageous. Four colas and a water are 32 euros and a decent glass of white wine is 12 EUR!- distance to center is a bit too fare - easy 40min walk and when it’s summer you’re sweaty and tires once reaching the center.- food in bar area is boring yet still pricy- breakfast is nice for the eye but also boring and expensive. Fruit (except a melon) is whole and simply eating a whole apple is not appealing...- staff seems nice but very young- pool is too coldConclusion: nice hotel but too many “buts”...,"July 29, 2018","28    Hotel VIU Milan

Upon arrival we received a very warm welcome and got upgraded to a room with terrace, which absolutely topped it off for us, as I quite enjoyed sitting outside and reading. Bathroom furnishings were luxurious and the bed a dream.The Pool and Bar / Breakfast area on the rooftop were amazing as the view over Milan was so relaxing and the food delicious.As we wanted to discover Milan we received valuable advise from the concierge - everything we wanted to do was walkable and we discovered a few hidden gems that way too. Similarly I had a list of restaurants that I was advised to try out. The concierge again gave us some local insight, inquired about our desires and then 2 nights in a row gave us the best advise on where to eat and booked for us. We didn't regret it once as we had delicious food, restaurants known and visited by locals and appropriate for what we wanted to spent.Overall a fantastic long weekend!

Plush, good quality bed, sheets & furnishings; much attention were paid to details. We were provided a proper baby cot for our 9 month old instead of the usual flimsy pack & play cots that most places offered.Staff are friendly and helpful. Breakfast was quite good. It was pleasant sitting outside on the rooftop restaurant in summer. Only downside is that it overlooked a construction site but this is a temporary nuisance.

1579,"This hotel is very nice, but for the price it still could do little bit better. On the arrival nobody is outside to welcome you or to help you with the luggage, which should be really a standard in a 5* hotel. Staff at the reception is nice and friendly, our room was not ready yet (we have arrived half hour before check in) so we went for snacks and drink on the terrace, which is very nice. The pool on the terrace looks much bigger on the hotel official photos, its actually quite small for the hotel of this size so theres not enough space (only few sun beds, than some tables), if you are paying over 250€ per night you would expect better comfort there also it might be worth considering the pool adult only zone as I felt there like around public swimming pool. Breakfast for two is 70€ and for that prize again not that great, even though it has nice touches like fresh juices and good choice of fruit. Location is not that great, you are around chinatown, but lot of the places are closed.Rooms are nice, clean and comfy and staff is friendly and helpful.

1581,"Upon entering a cloud of interior perfume hits you which is not a great start. But things progressively went upwards after that. The hotel is clean, vey well operated and almost all staff is correct and exceptionally friendly. Our room ( in this case a 'superior' ) was a bit sombre and dark but the well appointed and spacious bathroom generously made up for that. Breakfast was great which is the exception in Italy where breakfast is very low on the list of priorities. The possibility of jumping in the pool on a hot Milan day deserves extra bonus points. The day of check out we were still offered access to the pool and gym ( which is reasonably equipped for a hotel gym) to shower and change which is real service. Overall Im really impressed. the staff nailed it for the full 5 stars for me.Room for improvement; the lighting in the room is all or nothing. The light-plan with touch panel doesn't really work in the IMO too dark room. The colour palette is just too dark and sombre and already a bit dated tbh. The consumptions at lounge/pool area are insanely expensive. Also, the pool is maybe a bit too small to accommodate multiple families with children.","July 9, 2018","28    Hotel VIU Milan

1586,"My husband and I stayed for a weekend (without kids) and I booked it because of their rooftop pool - This is my 5 stay in my Milan, which i have a great love for, and we have tried to see and be in different areas. Its about 30 min walk from the central (9 euro with an uber in day time//18 in the evening/night) but it's a lovely walk. Milan is beautiful and my opinion should be experienced by foot.When we came to the hotel, we were instantly impressed, It's very modern with many plants, and its typically trendy and modern hotel in an upcoming area, which can still look a bit more unpolished. We came early and had already plan to sit and work before we could check in - They did however try to accommodate us as good as they good. And we noticed right away that the service level was exceptional high. Some hotels can be so fancy and trendy, that you feel in the way, and some just make you feel that welcome and no matter what they wanna aim to please. And they did - There was some minor things with housekeeping, but they instantly tried to fix it, and instead of excuses or starting a debate who did what, it was just fixed.The room was spectacular, very modern with a walk in wardrobe which wanted me to change my house_now - very modern with lots of mirrors and the bathroom exactly op. of the wardrobe had mirror aswell, reflecting each other, make the space feel huge. The bathroom was amazing well with rainshower you just wanna live in - which my husband did for quite some time. Moden rooms, big tvs and comfy bed, and usb plus next to the bed. Personal I would have loved a bluetoth speaker and maybe some smart tv functionality, but I'm also a bit of tech freak:)The gym is small but very fresh, but you have to come early (or late) or it will be crowded (guys please add netflix option to the threadmill screens:))The breakfast at the rooftop.. Where to start..? It was amazing, My husband and I live quite healthy and we are a bit tired of fat breakfast with no healthy options.. When we asked for coffee with Almond or soy milk, they came with both.. Black glutenfree bread, fresh veggies and mozzarella made by angels..It's clear they went for smaller but much higher quality, which was fabulous, and yes sitting on top of Milan drinking Italien coffee (with soy milk) having the sun dancing in the pool.. Gives you a wonderful ""life is good feeling"" And it is - 5 big stars to VIU Milan for a wonderful stay.","June 20, 2018","28    Hotel VIU Milan

But he and his staff are incapable of adjusting the air conditioning in our room to achieve an ambient temperature less than 24 deg C. Having attended the room once and listened to our complaints on two further occasions they can only tell us that the room was getting cooler. In fact it did - after sunset it cooled by half a degree. As a result I am writing this review in the middle of the night unable to sleep and wondering whether our car is enjoying a more comfortable climate for the 38 euro/night we are paying for its accommodation.Unless you are a heat freak this hotel is not for you.,"June 20, 2018","28    Hotel VIU Milan

1600,"Me and my partner have just got home from an amazing stay with VIU. Upon arrival the reception area was beautiful and the friendly reception staff were very welcoming. Easy check in, we even got an upgrade on our room which was unexpected! Our room was absolutely gorgeous, very modern, very clean, the beds were so comfortable and we had a good view of the city. We were surprised to be given complimentary cakes when we got into our room which was a really nice touch.The roof terrace of the hotel is beautiful and has amazing paronamic views of the city. All staff were very friendly, always happy to help, always smiling and nothing seemed to be too much for them! It was our first visit to Milan and it won’t be our last! Beautiful city and we would definitely stay at VIU Milan hotel again. Thank you for making our first visit and stay so wonderful!","May 24, 2018","28    Hotel VIU Milan

The staff were warm and welcoming. The room was lovely and new. I loved the quite space. Nice quiet, elegant corridors. Great shower and bath with great brand on the amenities.

When we arrived, already got attracted by the interior and friendly lobby staff. Our room got upgraded to the junior suite since we're the SPG member, the terrace and everything inside the room are just perfect for us. Very clean and modern. Pool side restaurant on the 8th floor is must visit, beautiful setting and design, we enjoyed the lunch and breakfast so much! Special thanks to Laura and Stefano from front office. Very helpful.

Really love the outside sitting restaurant at the ground floor as well as the roof top bar. The staff come all the time to check my table and make sure everything is okay.

Good location and pool/roof top deck. The concierge team was attentive but was overly elaborative. We booked a family room- it was as described, modern and well appointed. The bistro (casual restaurant) downstairs was a bit disorganized. Too many servers, didn't get the orders right. To their credit they did give a round of drinks to make up for it.

1615,"This is my third stay in an NH hotel, the 1st here at Touring and for future Milano visits, this will be my first choice. Located a block from the Repubblica metro stop NH pays attention to the small details that make up a delightful stay. From the time you check into the spacious lobby offering fresh waters and gummy worms, to waking up in your comfortable bed, you’re a welcomed guest. The staff is sharp, they know hospitality and each staff member acknowledges you, provides information you want, spends all the time with you that’s needed, all without that often-found undercurrent of impatience or condescension of too many hotel staff. The rooms are comfortable-mine was a compact single-offering plenty of outlets, lighting, a large bathroom and upgraded linens and amenities. There’s a safe and stocked minibar. Coffee and tea service was offered in the lobby near the large breakfast area. The selection of breakfast items was so varied and abundant you’re going to stay a few days to be able to try everything! The noise level gets elevated when full of guests so go early for a quiet sit. The restaurant offered tasty choices plated with flair and with reasonable prices and the front desk staff offered several excellent recommendations outside as well.","June 26, 2019","29    NH Milano Touring

We found the hotel very easy to find.When we went to check in the Receptionist was very friendly and professional and advised us that our room had been upgraded to a Superior Room which was nice. Our room was very nicely appointed with a very comfortable bed, however, it was very very small and there didn't seem to be anything much superior about it. There was a lighted make up mirror in the bathroom so that was a bonus!The rooms were nice and quiet internally but the church bells start ringing on the hour and half hour from quite early in the morning which meant that I was awake from early on. Not sure what the hotel can do about that though!We ate breakfast and that was first class, lots of goodies to choose from and the staff again were very friendly.All in all, a very nice hotel in a decent location.","May 17, 2019","29    NH Milano Touring

1621,"This hotel is a disaster! For an enjoyable break, avoid this hotel. Having booked the hotel on a ‘pay at the property’ basis, the night before my friend and I were set to leave for Milan, we received an email from Hotels.com stating that the hotel had tried to take money out of my account before the day of arrival! Which they were unable to do due the bank blocking the transaction. As they were unable do so (baring in mind this wasn’t suppose to be done until check in), we called the hotel on the day we were flying out to Milan and we were told there wasn’t a reservation in our name as it the reservation hadn’t been secured (due to no payment being made)! which was poorly explained to us by the staff and asked if they could keep the room for us until we were to check in that evening, but the trainee staff which we were dealing with had actually put the phone down on us!! We called back 3/4 times and were repeatedly hung up on! As we had to leave for the airport we had to make the decision of leaving our house and to head off with the hope that a room would be available in the hotel! This is definitely not how we wanted our ‘relaxing’ city break to Milan to start!!. We landed Milan and took the taxi to our hotel and the appalling customer service didn’t end there! Having explained our situation to the staff at the hotel in an attempt to check in to a room (that we didn’t know that we had or not) there was no apology what so ever, they asked for out card details again and handed us the key. Having booked a twin room, they had given us a key to a double room which meant having to go back down to reception to change out rooms - having been through so much stress already that day, the last thing I wanted to do was to go back downstairs to complain! But it was something we had to do - again, there was no apology.The problems at the hotel were never ending and to complain about these would only dampener our city break therefore we chose not to complain to the staff as also didn’t think they would have been resolved by the staff due to the lack of interest shown by them up to this point. (One of the problems being the foul smell in the room & bathroom).For many reasons, I certainly would not recommend staying at this particular hotel as it well and truly ruined the initial part of our holiday. What a shame.","April 27, 2019","29    NH Milano Touring

1623,The location is very convenient- walking distance to both the central train station and the Duomo/city centre. The lobby area looks very nice but half of the room was taken up by a massive offie desk at the end of the bed - makes no sense at all! The doors also bang very loudly when they shut which is very annoying when the people in the rooms next door kept coming as going in the middle of the night. The “bedside” lights are actually hanging over the bed itself a meter high meaning that you will both be awake and blinded by the light so no option for one person to read while the other sleeps - another design disaster.,"April 3, 2019","29    NH Milano Touring

1639,Stayed here for a long weekend while shopping in Milan. Great location for the shopping area. Only about ten minutes walk to the shopping area. Hotel was lovely. We arrived very late as our flight was delayed. Our first room wasn’t big enough for the 4 of us on the 9th floor and I explained to the first person who checked us in that we were told our room was on the 3rd floor and would sleep 4 of us. So we all headed back down to reception and was helped by a lovely young lady who changed our room to the 3rd floor which could sleep 4. The room was very nice. Kettle fridge and hairdryer. No iron but as I had read the reviews I made sure I packed a travel iron. (There was an iron and ironing board in our first room so some rooms must have them). The room had a large double bed and sofa bed. The kids slept on the sofa bed the first night but said it was very uncomfortable so I went to reception and the same young lady who helped me the night before said she could put an extra bed in and also gave us the room next door complimentary for one of us to sleep in. This was outstanding customer service and was very pleased with this. On check out we was charged £1000 more than what we should of been till we realised we was being charged for 2 rooms. Then was produced someone else’s invoice until i shown our email of my Booking and then was charged the correct amount. I would stay here again if I was staying in Milan and would recommend to others. ,"September 27, 2018","29    NH Milano Touring

Otherwise one metro stop from the Milano centale. The staff was very friendly and the room was clean. We didn't have breakfast in the hotel - there are plenty of small cafes around where we enjoyed our first coffee in the morning.Our room was clean and big enough to accommodate all 3 of us, however it was on the second floor and the window was almost invisible!, with absolutely no view. The extra bed was kind of a mattress on the floor. However we were out all day, arrived late at the hotel and we decided that we could manage in it for our 2 nights stay.","September 8, 2018","29    NH Milano Touring

1643,"My partner and I stayed at the NH Milano Touring Hotel during 19th - 22nd August 2018. The staff checking us in was very friendly, helpful and gave a great service, especially Sharon from the reception, whom was very helpful and explained with a map to places of interest. The room was very comfortable, and clean in-fact probably one of the most comfortable beds I’ve ever slept in. The room had a television, although only news and music in English channels. Good wardrobe storage. Mini bar in refrigerator. Safe. Free wi-fi, which had a really good signal. Hairdryer, free toiletries, shower/bath. Room service. The hotel also has a lovely communal balcony, bar and restaurant & access to an ironing room. The breakfast is served 7-10, which has a good variety of quality cereal, pastries, meats, cheeses, tea, coffee and juices. MH Milano Touring is in a brilliant location, about a ten minute walk to the town, and cathedral. All the staff was very professional, helpful and friendly, they made us feel very welcomed. I would definitely recommend this hotel, and would definitely stay again. ","September 7, 2018","29    NH Milano Touring

My husband had trouble with the wi-fi as it was a bit weak in our room and he had to move near the door to get a stronger signal. The room was SPACIOUS, clean, and comfortable. He raved about the workout center during the entire stay. I rather enjoyed the coffee machine near the lobby and the light snacks offered. The location is fantastic! Since we were arriving by train from Florence, it was less than a 15 minute walk from the station. There are also Metro stations less than a 5 minute walk away. I wish I had noticed the free electric bike rentals, it would have been nice to explore the nearby parks.

1646,"I think it’s in a good location because it’s only about a mile from the central train station, just walk straight on the Main Street. It’s definitely a 4 star plus, very nice lobby, bar area, nice clean updated rooms and very comfy beds. I stayed here in Milano for 4 days. It is also in walking distance to the Duomo cathedral. The streets here in Milano can be a bit confusing but once you know where you are going, it becomes quite easy. Upon arrival, you are treated to cold water drinks and snacks at the reception. They also have a great happy hour in their bar/restaurant area which includes some delicious snacks and mini sandwiches with an order of just 1 drink.

You are not too far from important places in Milan, and the walk to/from the hotel is very enjoyable, as this is a business district and it is quite safe to walk. The hotel itself is clean, modern and well organised. The service is very professional and polite, and we really enjoyed our stay. The only crowded place is the breakfast restaurant, but only if you get there during the last hour of the service. Looking forward in going back.","August 5, 2018","29    NH Milano Touring

1649,"Truly rubbish quality for the price and the name.. internet is so slow, bathroom is rusty and falling apart. Bed sheet is good quality but has spots. To park your car (valet) they charge 30 whopping euros!! Parking is only 4 mins walk (westin hotel side). Parking near by costs 21 euro (some charge 15 per day). The “security” outside is very grumpy and unwelcoming (just the staring though haa). Location is okayish, by time you reach the nearest historical place (on foot), you are done for the day as footpaths and drivers are bananas in Milan :)All in all, the hotel should be 3 stars max, or charge us maximum half of the current fare.","August 1, 2018","29    NH Milano Touring

The room was great - comfortable and quiet with a rear facing window from which we could see the Duomo over the rooftops.

This hotel was close to the sights that Milan had to offer i.e, the Milan Cathedral and within walking distance to my place of work.The breakfast was very good with a world theme as well as Italian. The room was however a bit small but acceptable for business standards but it was lacking in plugs for my electronics. Apart from this they accepted ‘Apple Pay’ which was a bonus.

Chaima was instrumental in helping me find a flight home, I could not have done it without her help. I can not THANK her enough for her assistance and caring manner.

Paolo and the other excellent staff at the reception sorted immediately. 2 double bedrooms with a reasonable “addition”. Thank you very much.Spacious and clean rooms, bathrobe, well functioning safe, quiet. Comfy bed and pillows. Shower? The showerhead was too heavy and one needed to adjust it every 10 seconds. We were on the 8th floor and the water pressure was very low.Placed my car at the Autosilo (€22 per day), which is situated in Piazza della Repubblica (5 minutes on foot if you walk slowly). There is also a more expensive alternative (Palace garage €46,50 per day). There you can get your carwash and the price is some €20.Atmosphere? Very international, although the Spanish community is over represented. Free water on the floor. Great surprise!Wifi? The speed is below average and it is a pity in 2018.Breakfast? Go to Bianco Latte, which is 200m from the hotel. Turn left at the exit and left again (via Turati). It is on the left side of the pavement. It is exceptional, but you pay for the quality! Dinner? Look at my reviews of Rugantino, Osteria del Binari and Gino Sorbillo (fantastic pizzeria).Ice cream? Casa Infante (via Torino), Grom (via Manzoni) and Cova (via Monte Napoleone).Will go back to NH.

We did a pre check in providing passports etc & were told our room would be available at 3pm. We had to attend qualifying at the track & did not return until around 7pm. The pre check was a waste of time as we had to go through the whole process again.When we got to the room which was to be shared we found the second bed had not been made up & the room had been set up for one person. We had to request more towels, toiletries & for the second bed to be attended to. Luckily, this was done promptly.The rooms themselves are furnished in a modern style but feel cramped. As with every Italian hotel I’ve ever stayed in the TV has at best one station for English speakers & maybe one or two for other languages. It appears that Italian hotels are only set up for nationals use.Breakfast was just OK. There food available was average.On the whole, this hotel is pretty average & fine for a short stay. Unfortunately, the room rates are quite high & don’t represent good value for money.","April 25, 2018","29    NH Milano Touring
