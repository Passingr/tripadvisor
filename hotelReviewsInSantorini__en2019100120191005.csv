1,"Just back after spending a week here with friends. We were greeted by a really nice guy Alex who checked us in very quickly. He took us to our room and showed us everything in it. We stayed in a Delux studio with whirlpool. Fab room with loads of room for the 3 of us. The following morning we went for breakfast and met the daytime receptionist called Christina, what a fantastic person she is, nothing was too much for her to do. Anything she was asked about she could answer. Total credit to the hotel. We left as friends not customers. In the dining room there was a lady called Katrina and she was just so lovely. Will be back one day. Thanks to all of you for making our holiday memorable.","May 31, 2019","0    Atlantis Beach Villa

2,"Great hotel, small with very friendly staff. Must mention the 2 lovely ladies that kept our room looking clean. All on reception are very helpful and friendly, can't wait to visit again. Hotel is across the road from the beach with plenty of taverns and restaurants within a 10 minute walk.","May 29, 2019","0    Atlantis Beach Villa

3,"We have just returned from a weeks holiday, we were met by Alex around 10.30pm, he was extremely polite and helpfull, showed us to our room which, although basic, had tv, a fridge and aircon. The king sized bed was very comfortable, and the room was very clean and fresh. We were greeted by Christina at breakfast next morning who was equally helpfull and very cheerfull every day, nothing was too much of a problem and gave us very good advice regarding day trips etc.The pool area was well looked after and the bar area was clean with great staff, the menu was small but always freshly made, the bar closed at 10.30pm which added to the tranquility of the hotel. If we have one niggle, it is that the loungers were wooden and could probably do with replacing, still thats a small thing. The pool towels were free and the beach was directly across the road with free loungers for hotel guests, all in all a nice and peaceful hotel.The location of this hotel was excellent, out of the hotel turn right and 10-15 mins there are restaurants and bars, also the local bus stop, turn left 10-15 mins more bars and restaurants leading to Perissa which was more busy. Take care on the roads though as there are no pavements and flows both ways past the hotel, however, around 15 mins towards Perissa they have a pedestrianised area from 2pm where the majority of the restaurants and bars are.There are water sports available, jet ski, diving etc. As well as on beach facilities for food and drink from the bars and restaurants. We particularly enjoyed a small cafe called Chocolat, they did great food ans amazing crepes, huge crepes made fresh to order, I strongly recommend this place. When you get to the main road through Perissa call in to Dorians bar, excellent food and the drinks are more reasonable here than almost anywhere else, plays good music too.We visited Fira and Oia which although picturesque, were realy crouded with cruise ship tourists, glad we never stayed there as way too busy but equally glad we visited both places, be prepared for rude bus drivers and ticket collectors rushing you on and off the buses, and a very disorganised bus station. The air port is small and equally hap hazard.So to summarise, hotel was brilliant for whar we wanted, a nice quiet chill out holiday, located almost perfectly not to close or too far from anything you need, will definitely be returning agian.","May 22, 2019","0    Atlantis Beach Villa

4,"The room we had, although clean on the surface smelt fusty and old. We think this was coming from under the sink. The bathroom was poorly finished, with holes in the ceiling cracked tiles. The outdoor jacuzzi was nice, however again poorly finished - there was dirt around the edges of the tiles which was a little unsightly. Overall we were disappointed with the the standard of the room after the reception and pool area was so lovely. We had a lovely week though, didn't spend much time in the room. The staff were friendly and welcoming. I would return but would not expect to pay as much.","December 21, 2018","0    Atlantis Beach Villa

5,"Right on the beach , great swimming pool , the beach is a little bit rocky . Situated at about 5-10 minutes walking distance to the bus stop . The services at the reception desk is excellent , the room has a balcony . My air conditionning doesnt work properly , and the bathroom is outdated with a tiny old shower . The breakfast is very so-so.","November 6, 2018","0    Atlantis Beach Villa

6,"My partner and I travelled to Atlantis Beach Villa with TUI on 18th September 2018 for two weeks. We have had several holidays recently with TUI and have always been pleased with their care and organisation. This hotel is in a great location and our room on the 2nd floor was very nicely decorated. Sadly the water storage is heated by solar panels (20) of them for 44 rooms and just could not cope with the demand. During the whole two weeks we were there we had no more than luke warm water. Surprisingly there was a kettle in our room - no mugs, coffee or tea bags - and that was the only way I was able to obtain some hot water to wash. Very difficult to shower. The mechanic was called to our room and managed to obtain some hot water in the middle of the day! We had been advised by the Receptionist to run the tap for at least 10 or 15 mins. This was not acceptable and not successful. Our rep was not terribly interested and just told me she had no water at all where she was staying. (Not very helpful). The staff at this hotel are very helpful and friendly and its a pity that the hotel management cannot address this problem. The Island of Santorini is good to explore and if you can cope with the chaos at the bus terminus, the public buses are useful and a cheap way of travelling. The Greeks are such friendly happy people and despite their economic problems, rely on tourism and olive oil production to survive.","October 22, 2018","0    Atlantis Beach Villa

8,"I booked this hotel for my partner and I due to its location mainly, a 5-10 minute walk each way to various bars and restaurants etc and directly overlooking the beach. It didn’t disappoint in these regards- a stones throw from the beach and in a prime location to explore what else was around.The hotel itself was small but pretty ( I would say one of the more attractive looking hotels we had seen around the area) and it was very clean.The room was definitely very basic on the inside- it had everything you needed and nothing you didn’t. I initially felt a little disappointed with the amount I’d spent on the hotel to what we were actually getting for our money however, I think it is generally overpriced in Santorini, not just our hotel. The bed was not very comfortable at all but the rest of the room was fine- I understand from previous reviews what people meant about the shower/ shower curtain sticking to you but it wasn’t really a problem once you figured out how best to stand and the shower pressure was good.The pool was beautiful but we only swam in it once. This was probably my biggest issue with the hotel- people hogging sunbeds!! In the morning people seemed to get up early and put their towels on the beds to ‘reserve’ them for when they were ready to use them. By breakfast time, they were all taken but mainly by towels, not people. (And we never saw more than 2 people maximum in the pool at one time so that wasn’t why!)This happened everyday we were there and was never stopped by the hotel which was disappointing. I feel measures should definitely be in place to prevent people doing this as it really does affect your overall experience. Breakfast was again tasty but basic. Each day, the same food served. This would have been nice to have been altered slightly each day or every other day and I personally would have liked to see more fresh fruit options. I expected to eat breakfast at the seating area pictured on their website however it is not there, you eat in a small shaded table area at the entrance to the hotel so no beach view etc for this.Again, I feel it would have been nice to have the option to eat breakfast at the otherwise unoccupied bar area during that time so you could enjoy the view/have a bit more room.The beach area was lovely. With the hotel we had free use of their beach sunbeds which was great as otherwise there is a cost to use these in other areas along the beach. The beach area in front of the hotel was well maintained and the bar staff were attentive in checking if you wanted any drinks brought to you etc. The staff were friendly and helpful. The receptionist organised us two taxis to the winery which was very useful as apparently taxis in the area are extremely rare/hard to organise yourself. The maids were lovely, always smiling and did a great job and the bar staff were also pleasant.One final mention was the spa treatments we had there. The massuese was fantastic!! She was so knowledge in her field and had wonderful pressure. We had a back massage each and felt relaxed but also worked on with our tension areas. Highly recommend booking a massage there.Overall a good stay, definitely not the best hotel I’ve ever stayed at by any means but, probably one of the better hotels you can stay at in Santorini and if I ever stayed in Santorini again, I would likely book this hotel again due to the positives outweighing the negatives overall.","September 18, 2018","0    Atlantis Beach Villa

9,"We have just returned from our one week holiday Atlantis Beach Villa. First impressions was a very pretty, well maintained hotel with lovely grounds, pool and bar area. The staff were very helpful and friendly. I requested an upper floor, some months ago on booking. Our first disappointment was when we were shown to our room it was at the back of the hotel on the lower level basement. We were in the corner, no view and no sun. (may suit some when its hot) Most of all, we had a small high window with mesh and when open we could see people in the car park above who could equally see in if the light was on. We were only there for a week so we did'nt want to cause a fuss by asking to be moved. The room was dingy, however there were door windows but not ideal when taking a nap or getting changed so we had the curtains partially closed. The bed was very comfortable and the rooms cleaned everyday. The towels, i'm sorry to say were awful, although changed regularly they had a horrid smell. I am aware that biological powders cant be used. I used my own swimming towel to shower. The sunbed's!!.. I booked the hotel mainly for the lovely pool. We used it just once at 6pm! Everyday people got up early put their towels on the beds and went for breakfast!! or lunch. This was so irritating. It was definitely not just the Germans it was the British as well. Our friends at another hotel said people trying to do that at their hotel couldn't because the hotel did not allow it. I really think this problem should be stopped and i don't know why people are so selfish, we all pay to use the pool. The beach sunbed's were very comfortable and barely anyone using them. Free by the way with the hotel pass and beautiful and relaxing. We could'nt go in the sea as we are not strong swimmers and it shelved quite quickly. The location was ideal and easy to get around the island by bus. It was very quiet regards holiday makers in Parissa but places on the caldera were extremely busy with the cruise ships! Lovely food lovely weather. Sadly for us the things we did'nt like took the edge off of what could have been an amazing holiday.","September 18, 2018","0    Atlantis Beach Villa

10,"Just come back from a 2 week stay. Great hotel, just enough out of the heart of Perissa but close enough just a short 5 minute walk to restaurants. Hotel staff were so friendly especially at the So Good but So Food restaurant. Very clean and comfortable. However the shower was the tiniest shower I’ve ever come across with a shower curtain that clings to you throughout your shower. When we got there the shower was merely a trickle but after day 2 though the shower head was changed (thank you) making it great, despite the shower curtain still clinging to you. Would definitely stay here again despite the minuscule shower! Pop along to Sea La Vie bar (turn left out of the hotel) such a great little bar with funny, welcoming hosts.","September 11, 2018","0    Atlantis Beach Villa

11,"Atlantis Beach Villa is a perfect destination for someone who want to relax and spend a great time. The first thing that made me impressed is the behavior of the staff, from the recepsionists to the bar and the cleaners! Each one of them were smiling and ready to help every customer. Especially i really liked Mrs. Christina (she was the morning recepsionist) Secondly, the beach is in front of the hotel (which has also a swimming pool). Rooms were very clean and modern. In conclusion, this hotel was one of the best, if not the best, choice for my holidays this year. I'm looking forward to be there again. It is important to mention that Perivolos is a quiet area, if we compare it with Fira or Oia, which combines also great night life with lots of restaurants and bars.","September 7, 2018","0    Atlantis Beach Villa

12,Α perfect destination for someone who wants to relax and enjoy a great holiday. The rooms are really clean and the staff really kind and helpful. Remarkable is that it's near the sea so you have the choice between the sea and the pool. These holidays will stay forever in my mind.

13,"Beautiful clean accommodation in a really well placed area for both Perivolos and Perissa. Plenty of restaurants, watersports, beautiful scenery and cleab clear water for swimming and snorkelling. You do have to go out fairly deep to be able to see sealife.The staff were really helpful and polite and remember your drinks the next day which shows excellent customer service. The rooms were very clean and were cleaned everyday without fail, a little on the small side, but you don't spend much time in the room. I would totally recommend staying here.","August 30, 2018","0    Atlantis Beach Villa

14,"This smallish hotel is perfect .. it's placed in the middle of all the restaurants and bars .Rooms as said in previous reviews are basic but for us it was ideal and most importantly it was spotless and cleaned everyday .The pool is amazing and plenty of sunbeds to go round .Breakfast is really good enough there to set you up for the day .Food from the bar is excellent and cooked by a woman called Larysa she also works on the bar for a few hours .Bar prices I think are ok I read reviews before I arrived and were expecting really high prices but most prices for beer is roughly the same .I personally would like to thank the guys who work the bar they work extremely hard and always have time to answer any questions you might have , these guys work the beach , bar and pool and never seem to stop ... so to George , Mike , mario and George ( Sorry about spelling ) you guys made my holiday and sent us to some good places to take pictures .Ivan who greeted us when we arrived and the lady who works on reception in the daytime thank you for making us feel welcome .So all in all the hotel is small friendly amazing pool rooms spotless and the staff are the best that I have ever encountered on a holiday and for that reason I will be back in May 2019 .Thank you all the staff for an amazing holiday ","August 3, 2018","0    Atlantis Beach Villa

15,"Ok so the rooms are pretty basic and some might say indeed of modernizing. I couldn't fault them, after all I just shower,change and sleep in there. This said the only reason it doesn't get 5* is purely down to the fact it has shower curtains and the shower was tiny,so the blooming thing constantly stuck to you. In the end we didn't use it,but then the floor got soaked ( first world problems hey)The pool area is lovely and the staff are so polite, helpful and welcoming. I would definitely stop here again as you are bang in the middle of all the shops and restaurants.","July 26, 2018","0    Atlantis Beach Villa

16,"Just returned after a nice week at this hotel. On arrival and being shown the room, the first impression was it needed a revamp as it was looking tired but it was clean and tidy so was ok. The room had a free safe, kettle and hairdryer and tv that was really unwatchable due to the poor reception and air con which worked well. Plenty of sunbeds around the pool which were taken early but beach sunbeds were available through the the day. Prices at the hotel are very expensive as is the theme throughout the island although if you go to the main road the prices are a little cheaper. Hotel staff are really nice and helpful and the ladies who cleaned are lovely.Getting around is simple as all buses go to Thira and from there you can change buses to wherever you want to go.We enjoyed our stay as it is a beautiful island but won't return as there are lots of other palaces to visit.","July 14, 2018","0    Atlantis Beach Villa

17,"We just spent a week here. Hotel and surrounding pool area are very clean. Our room had a small balcony, but good size twin beds, there is a fridge and kettle provided as well as Air con and safe (free of charge). Our bathroom had the usual flappy curtain, but the lip to the shower just about caught the water so it didn't flood the floor too much, always plenty of hot water with good pressure. The room was cleaned every day.Breakfast was very tasty and lots of choice but the buffet area is quite small and you can get in one anothers way. Pool area had comfy sunloungers and the pool itself was lovely and clean but a bit cold. There was a small amount of towel reserving the beds but we used the beach too which belongs to the Hotel. A pool towel is provided but you need to use your own for the beach.As been reported it is black sand so Hot, sea clean but freezing ! Plenty of good choice or Tavernas nearby and bars that sell large beer for 2 Euro, Hotel it was 4 Euro.","June 21, 2018","0    Atlantis Beach Villa

18,"Like a lot of Greek hotels, first impression is of an attractive building in need of a little money to be spent on it. By day three the charm of the smiling staff has overtaken any concerns. These are not smiles for the tourists, they are sincere and honest.The pool needs better access, the sunbeds are a bit creaky, our bathroom had no room to swing a cat but we awoke to a view of the sea before spending a lazy day relaxing by the pool or on the beach where Georgios, Mario, another Georgos or Mikealis (, sorry for the spelling), would serve drinks and snacks where you lay. Christina and Alex also need a big thanks for their hospitality.Try the Greek cider, it really is quite good.","June 20, 2018","0    Atlantis Beach Villa

19,"This is a very cozy motel. The rooms are spacious and the one we stayed in had a private balcony overlooking the pool and with a view of the beach. The breakfast is very good with eggs, meats, fruit, and cereal. The black beach is across the street. Wifi on the beach is convenient for listening to music and surfing the Internet. The motel has beds and umbrellas for guests. The black sand gets very hot in the Summer. Stay on the white wooden paths. Also, water shoes provide protection from the hot sand and the rocky ocean. There are archaeological sites on the island and the museums are not to be missed.Get up early and watch the sunrise. In the evening go to the other side of the island and watch the sunset.

The atmosphere at the apartments and in fact the whole resort was so relaxed that you really did feel that you had been on holiday.The entire staff were fantastic and so friendly. We purchased breakfast every morning and we were set up for the day. It wasn't too busy and there was always plenty of sun beds.

21,"Stayed here for 2 weeks, and after reading some of the good reviews was really looking forward to the stay. We arrived late but checking in was relatively quick and the lovely staff were very friendly and helpful. Our room was nice, quite small and basic but had a lovely balcony/terrace area with deck chairs. We had booked our stay to include breakfast, so not sure if this was the reason why, but our room didn't have a kitchen area (just a fridge) and for a 2 week stay we weren't too happy with this so we asked to swap rooms. This was no problem, and once again the staff were extremely helpful and gave us a choice of 2 other rooms. Sadly they were both in the annex, which was a small building set away from the main hotel - however the rooms were so much bigger. It also wasn't as 'pretty' as the main hotel, nevertheless we opted for a lovely top floor room with an upstairs bedroom and large sitting/kitchen room and corner balcony downstairs. We were much happier staying here, and in the end it didn't matter so much that we weren't in the main hotel, it was much quieter too. During our stay we had a lovely time here. Location was great - bus stop a walkable distance away, and bars/restaurants a short walk in either direction. Also being located right beside the beach it was great to chose between the pool or the sea. The hotel provides towels for the pool which is great, and sun beds on the beach were free for hotel users! Inside reception there was also a load of books that guests could borrow/swap - I read 3! Finally breakfast - this was ok. There was quite a fair bit of choice, although mainly cold options and quite sugary. It's a self service 'buffet' style, but the room it is set up in is quite small, with everything situated in one corner of the room so it does get very busy/crowded, and it can take a while to get everything you want..especially waiting for the toaster! All in all we very much enjoyed our stay here and would definitely return. Lovely hotel, great location and wonderful staff! ","October 18, 2017","0    Atlantis Beach Villa

The pool is lovely and again no need to secure it with a towel at sunrise!!The rooms are simple but spotlessly cleaned and towels changed every day. As with most hotels the buffet breakfast could be a tad chaotic but the food was adequate and plentiful. What sets the bar is the staff. They are all friendly, happy and so helpful.

25,"This is a lovely hotel just on the outskirts of Perivolos on the Perissa side. The pool is beautiful and immaculately kept. There's a great bar where you can get reasonably priced drinks and snacks. Music plays all day but softly in the background. Great cocktails too :) The breakfast area is a bit small and got busy but the food was great and there was lots of it. Fresh bread every day, cheese and meat, yogurt, fruit, pastries and a coffee machine. The ladies who kept it stocked up were super friendly. Our room was disappointing - No. 41. It's kind of underground so like a tunnel with no windows, just in the door. We had to keep the curtains on the door closed if we were changing as otherwise people could see in. It looked nothing like the photos in the Thomson website. There were a couple of cracks in the tiles in the bathroom and a rusty toilet holder but these were minor problems. I just felt it fair to mention as we feel we overpaid through Thomson. See the photos of the room. The beds were made every day and I think clean pillow cases provided. Outside the room was swept daily as well. Ask for one of the higher up rooms. We did have a Jacuzzi outside the room which was good but cold water only (lovely on a really hot day) but it did have ingrained dirt around the edge which was off putting. The hotel was full so we couldn't get moved. There aren't enough loungers by the pool and people were out early claiming theirs with towels and often just leaving them there most of the day. However, the beach is literally across the road and has free loungers and umbrellas. The beach shelves quite a bit but lovely and warm and so clear. If you head out of the hotel and turn right, lots of lovely bars and restaurants. The beach also seems to not shelve as much down that end. Perissa also has loads of fantastic bars and restaurants. So much choice. Despite the disappointment with the room the hotel is great and we would go back again but ask for a different room. Santorini is stunning. We loved every minute of our stay there.","September 21, 2017","0    Atlantis Beach Villa

Katerina and Angela made sure we had lovely clean rooms and an excellent breakfast with plenty of choice and freshly baked cakes and croissants daily. Mario on the bar was very friendly and helpful and most of all Kristina who served drinks at the pool bar was so lovely and friendly and always had time for a chat with us about where to go and what to see on the island - she is an absolute asset to this hotel as many of the other guests commented.The pool is lovely and no trouble getting a sun bed even in August! The beach is right across the road and turn left or right out of the hotel to find many bars and tavernas. Bus stop more or less outside with buses to Thira and the sunset at Oia. Try Gods Garden taverna its up a side road off the beach but worth a visit as it is very reasonable and a nice family taverna. Also highly recommend the Greek night at Apollon with Greek singing and dancing a great evening! We will definitely return to this excellent little hotel.","September 17, 2017","0    Atlantis Beach Villa

27,"We would not normally return to a resort twice, but this is actually our 4th stay here. It is one of the nicest, friendliest, best located hotels. Very relaxed atmosphere, no need to get up at sunrise to put your towels out. The rooms are adequate, nice balconies some with sea view, some with a jacuzzi. Very clean and comfortable. Nice buffet breakfast with a range to to suit all. The pool is very clean and not busy or across the road is the beach. A good snack bar too. More deserving praise should be to the location, a short stroll you are into Perissa or turn right you have an abundance of good restaurants. ","September 6, 2017","0    Atlantis Beach Villa

30,"As lots of other reviews have stated this hotel is excellent. My girlfriend and I have just returned from a week in Santorini staying at the Atlantis Beach Villa and the whole experience was perfect. The staff were friendly and attentive. The room (we stayed in the deluxe studio with whirlpool) was clean, tidy, spacious and comfortable. The pool area was beautiful and we could always get two sun beds. Even in August there were rarely more than two people in the pool and maybe five or six couples on the sun beds. The location was perfect being right on the beach and very close to a good selection of bars and restaurants. Despite being so close to everything the hotel was quiet and relaxed.All in all a perfect stay in a lovely hotel.

The hotel offered us the transfer to and from the airport due to the reservation procedures we followed. They also provided us with a tasty bottle of local white wine because of our honeymoon. The beach next to the hotel was nice and not crowded and the swimming pool was clean.

32,"I booked our trip through Thomson as I was getting married in Santorini and needed somewhere which was reasonably priced and in a location which had something for everyone. Having visited Santorini last year we decided to pick this hotel having had a look around the rooms prior to booking. The staff in particular Alex and Christina were absolutely lovely. They were so friendly and nothing was too much trouble for them. We had a jacuzzi room and in all honesty if I was to go again I would not pay the extra money for this. Yes, it was nice to have our own little courtyard but it really wasn't needed as the pool and beach we perfect for relaxing and we didn't spend anytime in the jacuzzi. The rooms are pleasant but very basic and in all honesty could do with a bit of a revamp. Our room had a handheld shower which wasn't great but on the plus side there was always hot water whatever time you chose to shower. Other rooms did have rain showers which were much better than ours. The rooms were cleaned every day by the cleaners who were again all lovely.My only negative comment about this hotel would be the additional block which 8 of our guests were put in. We assumed that we would all be together in the main hotel, however this was not the case and next to the hotel is an additional building with further rooms. From the road it looks like this building is derelict as it stands alone behind a fence and locked gate. The grass is all dead and it is not pretty as the rest of the hotel is. 6 of the 8 guests staying there were really disappointed, in particular the two couples in the single rooms. They complained about the shower being full of mould with no shower curtain and no tiles on the wall. They felt disappointed that their rooms had cost them the same price as the others who were staying in the main hotel. I think this is something that Thomson need to advertise in their brochure as we did not know this building was part of the hotel until our guests were put there. Having said that we all had a lovely time, I would definitely return but I know others wouldn't. ","July 12, 2017","0    Atlantis Beach Villa

33,"We stayed here as part of a large wedding party. The hotel staff were extremely friendly and very helpful, nothing was too much trouble for them. The rooms were just what we were after, clean, simple and air conditioned. We had a fridge which was perfect for cooling the water as the weather had been the hottest there for 10 years. The position of the hotel is ideal, it's a 5 minute walk to the restaurants, but far enough away for a perfect nights sleep. The 2 swimming pools are great for kids and adults. A swallow pool for the kids, and a swallow end leading to a deep enough pool for proper adult swimming. The breakfast was basic but was absolutely fine for me and it did change slightly from day to day. I would very happily stay at this hotel again, we intend returning to Santorini in the future and will definitely look at this lovely hotel and hope to return.

37,"This is a great hotel and it turned out perfect for us :-) We had a terrace garden room, it was so lovely, a pergola strewn with bourgainvillea and a table and chairs where we sat with a glass of wine in an evening. Our room was nice, clean and with an area to make a cuppa. The bathroom wasn't perfect but fine for our needs, just depends on how picky you want to be. Our room was serviced everyday. We had free towels for the poolside and were given free loungers and sun brolly on the beach. The staff are so friendly and so willing to help, just ask them anything and they do their utmost to help and with a smile. One small criticism is the breakfast, it is limited and the same everyday, a little variety would of made all the difference. The beach is literally over the road, its black volcanic tiny pebble sand but the sea was warm and clear for swimming in. Either side of the hotel you have all the amenities you could wish for, water sports, restaurants, shops, local bus stop. We had a fantastic time on Santorini and its so beautiful, if you visit please go to The Santos Winery...the most beautiful place you will ever sit and have a glass of wine :-) Enjoy","October 10, 2016","0    Atlantis Beach Villa

The pool area is gorgeous, the sun beds plentiful and bar service friendly and efficient.Kristina on reception is very friendly and cannot do enough for you. The Spa was absolutely fabulous and Roula is the most friendly and lovely person who certainly knows her stuff. Breakfast was great with plenty of choice and the breakfast staff (who are also the cleaners) are great especially Katarina who was so bright and cheerful. The restaurants and shops are close by and we tried most of them ! The Acropolis was a favourite with great food and service at a good price.

39,"Read the reviews saw the pics on Thomson website, our room was disappointing to say the least. Our room was in a separate block completely separate from the complex, the bathroom was basically a cupboard! My partner is 6ft 2 and very broad and travelled with a broken elbow, the 'shower' had no wall bracket he couldn't lift his arm above his head, we went to reception they offered another room which was at the back of the complex in a basement, we refused it. Christina was excellent got maintenance to drill a bracket to fix shower to wall but overall bathroom was completely unsuitable, everywhere flooded, it smelt damp, the shower curtain was gross. The spiral stairs again completely unsuitable for a man my partners size, they felt unstable and I can't remember how many times I kicked the settee at the bottom. And he head butted the lamp shade in the bedroom.The view however was stunning, sea view and pool and the only saving grace of this room. All employees were so friendly, pool area lovely beach stunning and santorini is beautiful. Loved my holiday just hated that bathroom and stairs!!! You don't see this on the website so if you get villa 1-7 be wary!! You are outcast from the complex and the building is not in context with the main building, the whole area needs work, garden overgrown and in need of desperate work.

They also have a lot of sunbeds with umbrellas which are free to hotel guests just get a tag from the bar next to the pool .

41,Arrived here with my partner and our daughter and loved the place as soon as we drove along the beach road. The hotel complex is so pretty and we were welcomed by Alex on reception with a drink of sweet wine. - a nice touch.I must admit that first impressions of the room were that it was small and basic but we soon settled and became quite attached to our little beach-hut feel home.Couldn't fault the cleanliness. Clean towels daily and sheets seemed to be changed almost every other day too. The maids were friendly and always smiled and said hello.Kristina and Alex on reception were both excellent. Always a friendly greeting and happy to provide us with info for our stay.Pool area and views were stunning. Also nice to have the beach so close. Never a problem getting a psunbed.Pleasant walks either to Perivilos or Perissa. Favourite restaurant was Poseidon. Friendly family run place with good food at reasonable prices. The owner even gave us a bottle of their own wine as a gift on our last night.Would love to return to Santorini again soon and would stay at at the Atlantis Beach again. ,"September 20, 2016","0    Atlantis Beach Villa

45,"Beautiful resort, really friendly staff, they would arrange anything for you if you asked. My only let down was that we paid extra for a jacuzzi room to celebrate our honeymoon and it turned out to be a small, dark room with no windows and no view. We had a small outside space, which in my opinion felt quite boxed in because you're surrounded by high white walls. The jacuzzi was cold and because the walls blocked out the sun for most of the day it was too cold to enjoy. They did give us a little bottle of wine though, which was thoughtful. Perissa was lovely, really nice and chilled. The pool space and beach area was fab so we spent most of our time out of the room anyway. I would just advise not to pay for the jacuzzi room if you're going as a couple. The jaccuzi rooms for families were more like what we saw on google images and they cannot give those rooms to two people.","September 5, 2016","0    Atlantis Beach Villa

46,"My wife and I met some friends here for our two week holiday.I must say first impressions were very good from the road side the Atlantis beach villas look very attractive with a pleasant looking restaurant and pool area and even the road down to reception all very lovely.Reception its self was very pretty and on the outside flowers flowing down the building all very tidy, then we were taken to our room !! well we did think we were being taken to a different hotel, I take they have taken on the building next door with nothing more than a concrete footpath leading to a small studio block, the gardens were awful and nothing to look at there was a rusty gate down by the road, that was always lost and the exterior paint was a different colour to the main building so they didn't even look part of the same complex.The room was just that really and it was tiny and we couldn't use our balcony because it was so small and the table was broken, the kitchen area was fine but wow in all the years going to Greece this was really the most basic very much so below par. The bathroom was very ugly with its red towel rail, toilet roll holder, mirror and shelf and I must say the worst shower ever not only was it not much more than a trickle it didn't even hang on the wall there was no bracket to hang it. The towels were changed daily but they were very rough.The pool area was lovely with comfy sunbeds our first week was a struggle for beds because it seemed people was getting up at around six to put the towels out week two was fine and there were plenty of beds, After travelling to the Greek islands for years and knowing that they can be very basic I just expected a little more after reading so many positive reviews and sadly the Atlantis didn't really deliver I think being in the naughty building spoilt things more than anything for me.I will point out at no point in the two weeks could we fault any of the staff they were all fantastic every one of them,While we would go back to Santorini we sadly would not return to the Atlantis unless we knew we could stay in the main apartments,","September 2, 2016","0    Atlantis Beach Villa

The spa facility was a lovely bonus and both my hubby and myself enjoyed a relaxing massage during our stay. I would definitely recommend this hotel. We had a superior double room with a beautiful balcony. The rooms are furnished in a typically Greek fashion but it was spotlessly clean and the towels were changed daily.

49,"We had the pleasure of staying at this lovely small and friendly hotel at the end of May/beginning of June. We had an upgrade to a superior room with a gorgeous bougainvillea covered balcony, double bed an small kitchenette. The included buffet breakfast had plenty of choice with hot and cold drinks, cereals, bread, croissants (fresh and warm), cheese, ham, eggs, tomatoes, cucumber, feta cheese, honey, jams, Greek yoghurt, and fruit. The hotel is just across the road from the beach where you are able to use the sun loungers free of charge. There is a beautiful pool area with palm trees and also a Jacuzzi. A free bus, which they will order for you at reception, will take you to the supermarket, wait for you to do your shopping and take you back. The hotel makes an ideal base from which to explore the island. There are plenty of restaurants and bars within easy walking distance, some of which provide live music or ""traditional Greek nights"". You can catch a water taxi at the end of the beach in Perissa over to the resort of Kamari, or you can take a hike up the hill to visit Ancient Thira with magnificent views over Kamari and Perissa (check the opening times if you want to visit the archaeological site itself). The local buses take you to Fira but if you want to be able to make the most of your visit, it's best to hire a car which is relatively inexpensive, and parking at the hotel is free. There are plenty of local car rental shops. We had a convertible Smart Car which was loads of fun (and easy to park and negotiate the sometimes quite narrow streets). Fira and Oia are definitely worth visiting - every bit as gorgeous as the photos you see of them. It's also worth going on a couple of boat trips too, visiting some of the other islands (Nea Kameni and Thirassia) and the sunset cruise. Some of the sunsets on Santorini are spectacular and if you get up early enough, you can be treated to a fabulous sunrise in front of the hotel! Kristina, Alex and the rest of the staff are very welcoming and helpful and the room was cleaned every day with towels being replaced regularly. They provide towels for the pool area (you pay a deposit which you get back when you return them) although they ask you don't take them on the beach. A warning about the sea - it does shelve steeply and you are soon out of your depth. That suited us but for non-swimmers or children, you'd need to be careful. Fairly good for snorkelling, though, and there are plenty of water-sports on offer nearby.","August 4, 2016","0    Atlantis Beach Villa

55,"My wife and I returned from 8 nights on Santorini staying at the Apanemo Hotel eager to tell all friends and family without hesitation where to stay on this magnificant Greek island. It is one of the most beautiful islands and hotels we've ever visited and that includes several resorts in Hawaii where I'm from. First its location at the quiet southern end of the island fit our style: we could journey to the tourist areas of Fira and Oia during the day, but return to the quiet side at night. Also I can imagine that the prices are more reasonable, we certainly found the Apanemo reasonable for June-July time of year. Second, the hotel is as beautiful as the photos show: our room had a breath-taking patio where we could sit in late evening, watch the sun go down, the lights of Fira and Oia sparkle as the night darkened and watch the boats in and out of the harbor, the caldera. Third, the people are so friendly, everything is taken care of, the breakfast and breakfast room (all important to me!) including their coffee, freshly-squeezed orange juice, are all 5 Stars. They drop off a bottle of rose one night, a bottle of white another. Room service: their kitchen serves wonderful food up to 10:30 at night, brings it right to our patio as we watch the night darken. The room is one-of-a-kind: not a Marriott or Sheraton, but spacious, windows to the sea, large shower for two built into the hillside. Overall: this is a Let's Return hotel on a beautiful island.","July 8, 2019","1    Apanemo

56,"We stayed at Apanemo for our 30th anniversary trip to Greece. Located in Akrotiri instead of busy Fira or Oia was perfect for us. It is in a nice, quiet area yet it was easy to get around (I recommend having a car even though the staff was wonderful about driving you to close by places for free). Our room was a bit different as the bed is upstairs in the loft and was only accessible by ladder. We overlooked the sea and the caldera, and we loved the gorgeous views! The pool is a highlight (even though the water was chilly). It overlooks the caldera and is very nice. The included breakfast was good and offered both hot and cold options. They will even make you custom coffees. The bathroom sink was clogged at first, but the staff did fix that right away. The staff is very kind and friendly. I would recommend a stay at Apanemo when visiting Santorini!","July 1, 2019","1    Apanemo

57,"We stayed here for 1 night only, as I wanted to see the view from here as well. In the same trip, we also stayed 2 nights in Firostefani, and 1 night in Kamari. We'd also hiked to Oia, so I have a pretty good reference to compare with.In hindsight, I wish we'd spent 1 night in Kamari and 3 in Apanemo. Firostefani was great, but just too expensive (500/night). For others, I'd recommend staying here in Apanemo, and taking a bus to Fira, or staying 1 night in Fira if you really insist.Hotel Apanemo was great - it's located on the southern part of the horseshoe that is the island, where it's much less busy. The view from the hotel is amazing - better than from Fira, Firostefani, Oia, or anywhere we'd been. The staff was very friendly and arranged a 4 AM airport pickup for us, and a breakfast bag, even though the time between our check-in and check-out was only 12 hours. They even offer complimentary pick-up and drop-off in the Aktoriri area, which is awesome, as it lets you get around to restaurants and sights without having to walk or call a taxi. We used this to get to and from the restaurant they recommended and it was really nice to have.The hotel also offers a complementary cell phone with unlimited international calls to many destinations (most countries in Europe and the US were included), with google maps, a browser, and other apps on it. Again, really nice!The only negative I have is that the mattress wasn't super comfortable. It's a box spring, and you can feel where the springs are. We still slept well - it wasn't bad by any stretch, but replacing the mattresses with more expensive ones is something management should consider.Also, we found the water in the hotel to be somewhat irritating to your eyes when you shower. I know it's desalinated, but it was more pleasant in Firostefani.Location: 9/10 (calm and quiet)Service: 10/10Room: 8/10Value: 10/10Overall: 9.5/10","June 30, 2019","1    Apanemo

58,"This has got to be the most beautiful hotel we have visited in Europe, the scenery is amazing especially the pool area as you have the view of Fira and Oia and you can watch the cruise ships coming in each morning it’s so beautiful.The staff here are so helpful and are happy to drive you to restaurants around Akrotiri and also book any restaurants and boat trips for you.They will also drop you to the local bus stop so We decided to head to Fira then to Oia one morning (you need to get two buses) I would recommend heading to Oia early as it gets really busy after lunch but it’s worth the journey as we preferred it to Fira which seems to always be manic ! I booked in advance a couple of restaurants in Fira for the sunset view which is a must but it was so nice coming back to our peaceful hotel. I would recommend doing the Santo winery, Akro beach is beautiful for dinner, the boat trip which the hotel will book for you and the local town is really pretty we went there a few times in the day for lunch.All in all we have had a great holiday and if your thinking of visiting Santorini this hotel has everything and it’s in the perfect spot ","June 23, 2019","1    Apanemo

60,"Oh well, if you are going to visit Santorini, we highly recommend to choose to stay in this beautiful hotel. It's far from the tourist crowd, maybe you have to rent a car during your stay here, but it is really worth it. (Fira and Oia is maximum an hour by car from Akrotiri, but two days are enough to visit them).Apanemo offers you the loveliest vibe to chill, and relax with a fantastic view to the caldera, an ""instagramic"" pool, rich breakfast and really helpful staff. They drive you to restaurants in Aktoriri if you want (our favorite was the Good Heart), and to the red beach as well, which is a must see around this place.

61,"My wife and I stayed at Hotel Apanemo for 6 nights during our honeymoon trip. We LOVED everything about the hotel and it’s staff. The view of the caldera is incredible, the rooms are spacious and always clean, and we were removed from the busyness of the rest of the island. By far the best part about our stay was the staff. Spiros and his team are incredible and are willing to provide whatever is needed to make your stay more enjoyable. During our time, the staff helped us with a rental car arrangement, catamaran booking, transport to the airport, countless shuttles around Akrotiri, all with an smile and a friendly disposition. They even prepared a bagged breakfast on our last morning as we had to leave the island very early. Isabel and Nikos were two of the many staff members that were incredibly helpful during our trip. I did a lot of research to ensure that I picked the best place for my wife and I’s special week, and I hit the jackpot with Hotel Apanemo. I would highly recommend anyone that visits Santorini stay at this hotel. Would rate it more than 5 stars if I could!","June 16, 2019","1    Apanemo

64,"I have used TA for years but never written a review until now when I feel compelled to.I booked this boutique type hotel for my wife's 50th birthday with 3 other couples and wow is all that I can really say! The hotel is a great setting with the perfect view of the island and caldera with ships occasionally sailing by (I would never ever tire of that special view). The hotel rooms are spacious, spotless and all views from the terrace are pretty darn good. The pool area is classy with nice beds and refreshing pools with breathtaking view again. So the basics over, the real difference here is simply the people and their attitude towards you. They cannot do enough to try to make your stay a stress free experience from arranging a champagne birthday breakfast in a private area, to moving tables into the sunshine with free-flowing beer and wine, to arranging taxis all over the island, to arranging a late dinner after a sunset cruise - nothing was too much trouble (even the occasional lively/loud outbursts )!Thanks especially to Isabel and Natalia who smiled and laughed with us and Spiros for making it all happen (as well as all other unsung staff).Brilliant place brilliant staff - can't recommended highly enough!","May 31, 2019","1    Apanemo

Everyone was very friendly and helpful, to say the least. We liked the size of the establishment, because we were able to visit with the people working there.

From the reception to the restaurant to the house keeping they make sure that the guests are comfortable. The hotel is slightly far from the main areas of Santorini but they provide free shuttle to the nearest bus stop. The only thing I would like to point out here is that if they provide free shuttle for pick up and drop for guests on check-in and check-out it will be great. We checked out of the hotel early morning but there was nobody to take out our luggage, I wonder in case of any emergency how would anybody contact them. Rest was great and beautiful.

74,"Where do I even begin! The staff are amazing and are extremely accommodating to guests- I was trying to plan a friends trip for 8, but a month before, half of our group could no longer come due to family issues. Free cancellation came in very handy. We chose an Executive Traditional suite and a Superior Suite between four people and we’re absolutelh blown away by how clean, new, and aesthetically pleasing the rooms were! Added bonus the amazing balconies both rooms had. The towels and linens smelled like lavender and were super fresh and clean, which is a huge plus for me.  Free breakfast bar was so delicious and more than we could ask for to start the day. We were present for Greek easter and had the opportunity to try some of their sweets like the donuts and honey cake- so yummy! Greek coffee was the perfect accompaniment and an excellent way to start the day. The restaurant at the hotel did have good food, but they also recommended and offered free rides to local places to enjoy nice dinners, how many places do that ?! Super convenient and useful.The pool and outdoor spaces here are absolutely breathtaking and are cared for very well. The pool was amazing to sit by and relax while the staff bring over cold drinks. The view from the pool area is overlooking the whole Caldera and definitely a good place to take pictures.The reception staff, Zenny and Nikos, were so helpful in planning out activities for us that included hotel pickups AND even helped us rent a car! This allowed us to see every bit of Santorini at our leisure and was so much more reasonable than taking cabs everywhere (unless you go out drinking- they will call a cab for you and recommend fun clubs to go to!)At the end of our adventure, we had to leave at 6am to catch our flight back to Athens. We had bags of breakfast and snacks for what seemed like the whole day delivered to our rooms the night before. They really did think of everything!I 100% recommend this place to anyone visiting Santorini. Akrotiri is the gem on the island of Santorini (Oia and Fira are way too crowded and expensive - day trips were a bit stressful here) and Apanemo will help you enjoy the entire island while staying in the most peaceful part. You’ll really feel that Greek family hospitality while you stay here.","May 2, 2019","1    Apanemo

What you cannot anticipate is the heart and soul of the people here. They offer rides to the Red Rock beach and other local attractions/restaurants, making the need for taxi’s less of a burden. The staff, particularly Isabelle made the stay full of laughs and love. It was a remarkable way to spend my parents 45th anniversary, they even supplied a complimentary bottle of Santorini Rosè to greet them in their room upon arrival! I rarely write reviews but I absolutely had to in this case. The affordable price is what drew is to the hotel, the experience made us feel as if we were at the best hotel on Santorini.

Even if it’s not really closed to Fira and Oía, it’s completely worth it. The views at the volcano are wonderful, you can enjoy it from the swimming pool and your room! It looks like paradise! It was impressive to look the sunrise from our bed!Also, the breakfast is so good, you have a lot of different choices of local products and the people that work there are so friendly, respectful and nice.

92,I’ve just returned from a 3 night stay here after going to a friends wedding on the island. I was travelling alone but was made to feel very welcome and comfortable from the moment I arrived by the hotel staff. The hotel is breathtaking from the views to the amazing rooms. The hotel offers a car service and were on hand to drive me to bars and restuarants in the local area free of charge and would even come and pick me up if I called them.

94,"Excellent check in process. Friendly, helpful, and informative staff. Beautiful layout and fancy outer appearance. A little humid and damp in the room causing dampness in our pillows and sheets. Staff changed the bedding upon our request only to return to our room with the same feeling. Excellent views of the caldera.Beautiful infinity pool. Suggestion, please consider an automatic heater for the pool to keep the water at a certain temperature since the pool is a big attraction to your hotel. In short, we couldn't enjoy the awesome pool because the water was too cold. Breakfast had a huge variety, however, some of the food wasn't kept hot, or even warm, the eggs and pancakes cooled off. Why isn't there a warmer underneath? This doesn't make sense to go through all that effort, making all that great food, only to serve it cold. Nothing on tv, is there no cable in Greece since none of our 4 hotels had anything besides basic channels? Staff offers free rides to close by beaches and towns.

95,"We were on a cruise around the Aegean whose itinerary included an over night stay in Santorini and so we decided to book this hotel for the night. We arrived around mid day and had access to our room immediately. The room which was really an apartment was clean, spacious, well equipped and with the most wonderful view of the caldera. The infinity swimming pool is designed to cover three different levels and was superb.We had room service for lunch which was reasonably priced, efficient and delicious. The hotel provides a free transport service within the Akrotiri area and gave us a tour of several tavernas and left it up to us to decide which one we wanted to dine in! Needless to say that free transport was provided for our return. Truly amazing hospitality! Breakfast the following day provided a wide choice of delicious food in a dining room and terrace which offered stunning views. We were given a complimentary late check out which gave us more time in and around the magnificent pool area. We were sorry that our stay had been so brief but we will definitely return. We have traveled extensively and can honestly say that this is the best hotel stay which we have experienced.

At first, we thought that was a bad thing but it turned out to be for the best! It was very windy when we were there so the pool (unheated) was unusable however our patio was completely sheltered from the wind and in the morning/early afternoon was a sun trap.Breakfast every morning was delicious and we were greeted warmly by Isabel who was friendly, always smiling abd extremely professional.

Having never been to Santorini, we were worried about booking in the South, but consider it! They offered a shuttle to red beach and other places around the region, and it was great to be away from the congestion of Oia or Thera. Hire a driver and visit the rest of the island to see those classic Santorini views, then return to the Apanemo and hang in the pool and enjoy! No crowds!

The quality of the rooms is superb and the same for the breakfast. The best I had had during our visit to the island. Everything about this hotel is class, from the room to the pool but what makes it extra special and stands apart from other hotels is the amazing hospitality. In particular Isabel who is warm, friendly and accommodating. In fact all the staff were so professional and nice. We enjoyed a bottle of prosecco on the terrace whilst watching the sun go down and had breakfast and lunch the following day. The food is excellent and they have a very varied drinks menu. whilst spending the day by the pool we were waited on hand and foot and towels are provided for the sunbeds.

We did rent a car to be able to travel to the sites and towns throughout the island but they offered travel services if we wanted it. They also offered to pick us up from the airport. They answered emails quickly which was very much appreciated. It was great to come back every night to a quiet and picturesque location. The morning sunrise that we woke up to every morning was beautiful and we were able to enjoy the views from our private balcony. It was also nice to sun bathe next to and swim in the pool.The hotel is also very close to some great traditional restaurants (which are better and much cheaper than the fancy restaurants), one of the ports, the Akrotiri archaelogical site, a sunset perfect lighthouse, and the red beach.Also, on a personal note, the staff was very friendly, offered help with whatever we needed, and had great recommendations on restaurants and sites to visit.","September 30, 2018","1    Apanemo

We stayed 10 nights for our daughters wedding during which we were made to feel so welcome. Isabelle's breakfast starts the day off the right way and her home made cake is amazing. Alex bought coffee to our table every morning without being asked. The rooms are kept fresh and clean and serviced daily by a lovely young girl who was polite and friendly. We had a room with a stunning view of The Caldera but even the garden rooms have a beautiful outlook. The car service was excellent and you never waited more than a few minutes to be dropped off or picked up by Nikos, Alex or his brother. Even Spiros dropped what he was doing to take us into the village. The service on the front desk was helpful too. Thank you to everyone for making our holiday memorable.

104,"Most hotels on Santorini have a great view of the superb caldera and the Apanemo has one of the best. The hotel’s location in Akrotiri at the southern end of this extraordinary island has the advantage of putting it outside the maelstrom of tourists who converge every day on Fira, many of them from the enormous cruise-ships that threaten to despoil the bay below, or on Oia in the north for the daily sunset. Being in Akrotiri gives the Apanemo more peace and seclusion. There are several very good restaurants within easy walking distance -- and, best of all, the hotel’s every willing drivers will take you there and back, and elsewhere around the southern headland, for free and at the drop of a phone-call. This splendid hotel has the friendliest staff imaginable, always ready with a smile and a greeting and help or advice, and a free pick-up to bring you back to base. The infinity pool area offers views that you’ll never forget. There’s a copious breakfast to start you on your day and snacks provided throughout the day. The rooms are cool and spotlessly clean, each with a little terrace of its own. All at rates that are significantly less than many other establishments with less to offer.

Buffet breakfast (included) provided a lot of choice and was very good. We enjoyed Isabel's dry sense of humour and service during breakfast.Not sure if all the rooms are the same, but ours was not friendly to people with accessibility requirements. Indeed the hotel as a whole was not but we found this to be the rule rather than the exception in most of the hotels we stayed at during our 16 day vacation to the islands and Athens. At the Apanemo, our bedroom was in a loft accessed by fairly steep stairs with only one bathroom located on the main floor. No shortage of exercise!All in all a great experience and one we would repeat and recommend highly. Thanks to Spiros and staff for making our stay so enjoyable.

106,"Apanemo is an incredible gem-like hotel away from the busy and bustling scene of Oia and Fira. It is a quieter part of Santorini and owns a 5-star view from the hotel infiniti pool and many vantage point of the hotel. You do need to travel 25 minutes from Fira to get here but the journey across the local villages is part of the unique Santorini experience.We stayed here for 3 nights and the staff took care of us well. The manager was always tentative to our questions and staff like Isbel and Ivan(?) helped us with day-to-day traveling needs. I like to drink tea in the morning and they always filled my thermo bottle with warm water so I can have that. The breakfast is fresh and healthy with all the local jam, olives and tasty cold cuts. Everything you see on the site is what you will get from the hotel, or even better as real experience is always better. I miss the place already, so book your stay with plenty of time to savor the view there and everything else : )","September 11, 2018","1    Apanemo

107,"Coming to Apanemo has been one of the most incredible experiences we have ever had. We arrived off an early flight before picking up our rental car the gentleman asked us where we would be staying and we mentioned Apanemo. His immediate response was Apanemo is a beautiful hotel with the most amazing views. we were even more excited, at check in and were welcomed in kindly by Isabella. It was around 6am and she offered us coffee and made us feel more than welcome. Mind you it was the BEST columbaian coffee! Our stay kept getting better being British comes at a cost of being a hard tea drinker. We asked for a kettle and it was delieverd immediately to our room. We had also forgotten our mobile car charges and Spiros ( the man who never says no) gave us his own. Nothing was overlooked. We felt at home right from the start. he also allowed us to take a range of herbal teas from breakfast! the highlights of our trip were breakfast which was cooked by Isabella. The most delicious breakfast we have EVER tasted. In particular the vanilla pots which we woke up EXTRA early to get our hands on. isabella is an amazing cook she has been our mother away from home. the room was beautifully renovated, clean modern and extremely comfortable. a large fridge was also provided which we found useful. we stayed in number 3 highly reccomended garden view and sea view! Unfortunately we were only able to book a three day stay at Apanemo due to it being sold out! (because it is FANTASTIC) we are writing after staying at another hotel and it was incomparable to Apanemo. Our last day in Santorini we were craving such a good breakfast we asked Spiros if we could come back. He jumped up with excitement and told us we were welcome to come back have breakfast and use the pool whenever we wanted to. he was not joking because on our last day we actually took his offer up after having an appalling breakfast at our other hotel. we missed isabella’s fresh homemade breakfast!We believe this hotel is Santorinis hidden gem in Akrotiri. a home away from home. The most outstanding views. we have taken pictures on our dslr and drone which we will upload shortly. thank you Spiros and team for the most amazing stay in Santorini you have given us the best experience! please do not believe any negative reviews!We tried to think of cons to make this review balanced and realistic but there were NONE!!","September 8, 2018","1    Apanemo

I’ve stayed in 5 star hotels where I’ve not received the treatment I’m getting here. From the driver collecting me from airport and giving me a tour as we drove to hotel to the check in it was smooth sailing. The 2 young staff behind the bar are the best! The reason I come back from the beach in the afternoon to have my banter with them. Rooms are big, breakfast is great, there’s also room by the pool it’s just the perfect size. You have ocean views from the pool. As mentioned, supermarket only 5 mins away but it’s only 3 euro for ice cold beer by the pool which is great. Sooo many restaurants on the beach all with happy hrs and cheap good food. The bus to fira is at the shop (5 mins) it takes about 30/40 mins and cost 2.4 euro. I’m glad I didn’t stay in fira or oia as it’s full of tourist. Here I can walk on the 4km of beach and pick any lounger for free in most places! Awesome place. ","June 22, 2019","2    Smaragdi Hotel

We were taken care of wonderfully!Accommodations: They have an excellent customer service, arrived at the hotel for an early check in, forgot to tell them that we were coming in super early since our flight from Athens to Santorini was booked separately. It was literally 7 am in the morning and check in was 3 pm (i think) and he was so gracious to not give us any problem but instead he had the cleaning service made our room priority to have it ready. Informed us that breakfast will be served in an hour if we wanted to join. They have one of the best cappuccino freddo, by the way. They made us feel really welcomed and they have 6:00 pm meeting our first day ti give you tips on what to do and what not to thing kinda thing. Location: 2 mints away from the black sand beach.Everything is accessible by bus just ask the reception for Bus stop schedule. Close enough to the tourist spots in Santorini but far enough from the busy area or from the scrambling tourist. Gives you that vacation relaxed felling by the beach after a long day, looking for that perfect picture spot in Oia or in Fira. Good Restaurant is around the area too.

The rooms were basic but very comfortable and had little touches such as free WiFi, safe and aircon which are becoming more often then not chargeable extras elsewhere around the world. We didn’t have too much to eat or drink at the hotel as we preferred to eat out but what we did have was always tasty and good value.

119,"We booked this hotel and transfer independently. We arrived mid afternoon and were welcomed immediately by Maria and other members of staff. The hotel is based in Perivolous which is the southern end of Perissa. It is not your standard hotel block but an eclectic mix of rooms on ground or first floor level. We had booked a deluxe room and we were very happy with it. There was plenty of room for 2 people. We overlooked the ‘mountain’ which is Santorini’s highest point, north facing.The bed was comfortable,there was a sink with some basic utensils, crockery and glasses a small fridge, pull out table(never needed) as we spent time outside.The housekeeping was excellent it was kept immaculately clean. The bathroom was modern and had twin shower heads in a tiled cubicle. The whole hotel grounds is immaculate and tastefully done. We had breakfast €8 each day if paid for up front. It was fine and a good way to start the day.Maria offered a welcome meeting and provided all you need to know about Santorini. No doubt you will travel to Thira and Oia and if you do not have a car catch the bus from Euromarket, turn right from reception to the end of the road then turn left and you can’t miss it the bus will take you back to Perissa via the main road before it sets off to Thira, all buses start and end in Thira. €2.40 then €1.80 to Oia. They do get busy and can be quite entertaining.On the way back ask for the stop you want the conductor will remember the stop you want and shout so you won’t forget. We also got the bus to Akrotiri you will have to change but it works and they’ll tell you where to get the other bus. There are many places on the beach for sunbeds etc. Some are free but the taverns,cafe, restaurant will offer you the menu. The hotel will recommend a restaurant around the corner, they’re free but I thought the drinks to be on the expensive side 6€ for a large beer. 2.5€ the other way. Most restaurants shops and bars are on the beach road but not exclusively so check the main road and some of the roads that connect the main and beach roads. Would I go back to this hotel....you bet!.","October 11, 2018","2    Smaragdi Hotel

120,"Stayed in this hotel for a few nights in September and the staff (Maria and the others) gave a truly memorable experience. They gave a great service at all times and provided good information about nearby places to visit. Moreover, the staff was really helpful as they helped us to order food from different restaurants. The hotel itself was beautiful. The room provided to us was very clean and the beds were decent. The view from the balcony was picturesque. The cleaner was great and gave excellent service. Highly recommend anyone to visit this hotel.","October 2, 2018","2    Smaragdi Hotel

121,"We stayed at this wonderful place to wind down from a hectic traveling schedule. Perfect sums up our experience there.Never in all my years of travel have I gotten a more hospitable welcome from staff. They even did a small orientation with us on the first day. Explaining the lay of the land, modes of transport around the island, and all the things they could assist with - which was everything!They assisted making reservations, booking tours and calling taxi’s for us (even if pick up was not at the hotel).This gem is away from the touristy & commercialized main towns at the black beach.You don’t stay directly on the beach, but in a very small walk down the road to the ocean.The hotel is set up like small villas/chalets on the property rather than generic hotel blocks.We stayed in in a standard room, which is more than enough space for 2 people.Rooms were spacious and very clean.","September 25, 2018","2    Smaragdi Hotel

First of all we cannot thank all the staff enough for being so helpful and so patient with all our requirements. They helped us a lot with so many things like booking transfer cars, finding the best florists etc. The breakfast has lots of choices and everything was fresh for a reasonable price.

124,"Stayed here for a week and didn’t want to leave when the time came!! We wished we had booked for 2 weeks. When we arrived at the airport we were met by the hotels driver who was very informative and he pointed out places of interest on the way back to the hotel. There are 2 restaurants on the beach front that offer a 5% discount for staying at Smaragdi, we didn’t eat at either of them as there were so many lovely tavernas/restaurants along the beach front. Had very lovely food out all week. You can choose to turn left or right at the beach and you won’t be disappointed where you dine.The room was basic but spotlessly clean. Had a fridge, safe and air con in the room all at no extra cost. Room was cleaned every day an clean towels provided every day too. Fab shower which was great after a hot day lounging by the pool! Staff all very friendly and definitely worth going to the welcome meeting, very informative. We hired a car for a few days through Easy car rental and also booked a romantic sunset cruise (with dinner on board and nearby pick up and drop off) through them too. Excellent value for money for both and thoroughly enjoyed the sunset cruise. We drove up to Oia and wow what a lovely place, bright white buildings and fantastic places to shop and eat. The views were stunning. All in all a very relaxing enjoyable stay and would definitely recommend Smaragdi","September 7, 2018","2    Smaragdi Hotel

125,The staff was super nice and joyfull. The hotel is really clean and we liked our rooms. Even the bar food was great. Couple min walk to a bus stop to go to Fira/Thira directly and just a couple mon from Perissa and the side walk along the beach were all the restaurant are. I recommend this place as it was nice and practical. I would stay there again if i go back as we prefered being near the beach then near the city. The staff also picked us up at the airport and arrange a taxi back to the port!,"September 5, 2018","2    Smaragdi Hotel

126,"When my boyfriend and I first arrived, we pulled up in our taxi and at first we were a little nervous. It was on a desolate dirt road. However, if you walk half a block passed the hotel, you are directly on the black beach, with the views and wonderful and cute restaurants. The staff was very friendly and tried to make our stay and accommodating as possible. The economy rooms were ok. Nothing special, but they were clean and had AC. The bathrooms were nice. The pool area was nice and the breakfast was really good! One of the best we had from a hotel in Greece. There were so many food options. The black beach is one of the nicest beaches in Santorini and it was really cool to be right there on it. There are buses within walking distance, however, it is kind of a pain and a long trip to go up to Oia from there.","September 4, 2018","2    Smaragdi Hotel

However it is a bit far from Fira Town. To reach this hotel, you can take a public bus as there is frequent service to the Perissa Beach and you can get off at Euro market stop which is one stop before Perissa beach.

If you're looking to be close to the caldera view, I would not recommend because the taxis are quite expensive in Santorini. However, the hotels in Fira and Oia are quite expensive so use your best judgement. Otherwise a nice stay for a reasonable price....","August 12, 2018","2    Smaragdi Hotel

The staff are delightful and very friendly, and the rooms are large and spacious. Its is extremely clean- beds and towels changed very day, gardens cleaned constantly . A good location if you are visiting Perissa- tucked away a few yards from the sea but very close to restaurants and bars. Didn't eat the breakfast as it is the usual cornflakes, toast etc which isn't what I like. Overall a great place to stay if you are in Perissa.","July 31, 2018","2    Smaragdi Hotel

Then a very confortable room. They helped us with the rental of the motorbike as well. The atmosphere at the pool was very nice and quiet and the staff was always willing to help and make the stay really worth it. Perivolos and Perisaa have nice beaches not even 2min away from the hotel door. If we go back to Santorini, we will then repeat at Smaragdi. Thanks!Juan Anton","July 24, 2018","2    Smaragdi Hotel

132,"We stayed at the hotel from 7th - 14 July 2018. The hotel is in a great location, all restaurants and bars are within 10 mins walk. The hotel is situated on a quieter side of the island which was perfect for us. Hotel was very clean, our room was cleaned every day ( we stayed in a deluxe room) and fresh linen and towels changed daily too. The hotel provided a free pool towel which you could keep for your entire stay. However, the food is very limited as is more geared up towards a comfortable stay, this wasn't a problem as all other amenities were close by. We caught a local bus into Fira and onto Oia which was very entertaining and a good way to see the island too. For both bus journeys there and back we spent around less than 10 euros so is very cheap. We also arranged via the hotel a catamaran cruise - which wasn't cheap but well worth it, we had a lovely afternoon and evening and got to meet so really nice people, and ended the day watching the sunset which is magical, so I would highly recommend this trip. The only thing to watch out for is they serve food only once, so make sure you eat properly when they excursion people bring the food out, but the drinks were in their plentiful. Maria at the hotel provided a really good welcome meeting - giving us an insight to what is what - so recommend you attend that too. The hotel is linked up to a couple of restaurants, so if you want to visit the black sand beach which is literally two mins away, they provide the sunbeds and parasols for free, so make sure you use that facility. Our holiday was amazing, and we will definitely be back at some point, and I would recommend this hotel if you are looking for a total relaxed holiday. Tranquilo bar serves an amazing jug of sangria!! if you come out of the hotel and walk to the bottom of the road if you turn left or right the selection of bars and restaurants are all within walking distance. The hotel also provides you with a welcome bottle of wine and water and the aircon and safe are both free of charge. The hotel also sell bottles of water which you can keep in your room which we found really convenient. Overall, Maria and her staff were amazing.","July 23, 2018","2    Smaragdi Hotel

133,"Just got back from a week at Smaragdi Hotel with my sister and cannot praise it enough. The staff could not be more helpful and friendly. We stayed in one of the cheaper rooms and it was spotless with a great bathroom with rainshower plus handheld shower, both with strong pressure. The room was not very big but very comfortable. We asked to change our pillows for softer ones on the first night and this was done immediately. The outside areas were constantly being cleaned and the pool was always sparkling. Only a minute from the beaches of Perivolos and Perissa with many tavernas to choose from. An added bonus was no charge for majority of sunbeds on the beach if you simply bought a drink from the relevant bar/restaurant they belonged to. For a relaxing break i thoroughly recommend this hotel.","July 11, 2018","2    Smaragdi Hotel

138,"Smaragdi Hotel has everything you need with a family feel. Our room (#29) was really a suite on the ground floor with a great shower and a small table and seating area separated from the bedroom. Our room was casual but clean and included a porch with seating shared with the next room, but the lovely pool area was our main gathering spot. The staff was super-friendly and they are able to arrange excursion trips that pick up from the hotel. We rented a car at a reasonable price and I preferred exploring on our own, but we did take advantage of a boat trip that we set up through the hotel. We enjoyed breakfast at the hotel, but there are plenty of other options along the beach.Smaragdi is 1/2 block from a 2-mile long black sand beach. With a few breaks, the entire beach is serviced by restaurants and bars with umbrellas and lounge chairs (or king-sized beds in a few locations). It is a delightful beach experience with service while you relax. Whether you prefer casual or fine dining you won't go hungry here and the full moon drew us to the sea every night we were there!Perissa / Perivolos is a great spot to spend a few days. On the eastern side of the island (away from the caldera) it is much quieter than Oia or Fira. Yet the island is small enough that you can reach any part of it within an hour by car.

We arrived and our room was ready so we were able to check into our room straight away at 10:30am again another bonus of the hotel. Location is only 50 meters from the black beach so our kids could choose where they wanted to swim. The hotel reminded me of a small boutique hotel that made it feel cozy and warm. The rain showers were great after swimming. We had booked a family room so we slept upstairs while the kids slept down. When we checked out we did not realize that we had left our mobile phone behind and the hotel staff especially Aliki went to great lengths to contact me and return it to us in Athens where we were finishing our holiday.

150,"Key Highlight what I think are:-Very Close to beach, beautiful property.Nice pool and decent Jacuzzi(not hot obviously)Brilliant Breakfast - Worth every penny/centHelpful staff and good Guidance and support for renting car and recommendation on things to doEvening Induction kind of session with Juice next to pool with maps etcLot and Lot of reasonable price restaurants and bars on Pressia and Perivelos beachVery comfortable rooms with patio area (atleast the one we stayed in)Clean ToiletsLows:-Its not a low for hotel - Its about location. If you are not renting car or a Scooter - do not stay at Perivlos /Perissa - Bus service is okay, but with limited time in hand (2-3 days) would have been better to stay in Fira for accessibility.

151,"My husband and I have travelled quite a lot, but we have never received such a warm welcome and continuous customer support as we did from the lovely Maria and her team. We had an authentic large airey room with a mountain view. We used the beach where there are lots of sun beds to choose from. The highlight of our trip was the sunset catamaran cruise where you snorkel, bathe in the hot springs, then watch the sunset dining on fresh BBQ foods prepared onboard. Be careful in the hot springs as the water will colour your swimwear, so avoid whites and also remove your jewellery beforehand unless it's real gold. He best way to see the island is to hire a quad bike. You can catch the bus, but this is manic and lots of crowds fighting to get on. Perissa has lots of restaurants an bars, we liked Pergola. Santorini is magical. Enjoy!","October 2, 2017","2    Smaragdi Hotel

152,"Found this place courtesy of TripAdvisor and was absolutely NOT disappointed! The hotel is beautiful, located away from super touristy Oia, Fira and Perissa & instead in the more low key Perivolos. First off, the staff is wonderful. They are kind, cheerful & helpful. Upon arrival you have a welcome meeting where you're given a map and tour suggestions. The staff is happy to take care of any bookings. And the bartenders are my favorite! Such fun people. The pool area is beautiful & relaxing, but the beach is just at the end of the street (5 min walk) where you can spend the day on free lounge chairs at two restaurants the hotel has a relationship with. The restaurant ""Kouzina"" was especially delicious! Overall this was a great experience & I cannot WAIT to come back to Smaragdi :) thanks again!","September 19, 2017","2    Smaragdi Hotel

153,"Property includes bungalow-like rooms with a nice pool area, though it’s within easy walking distance, maybe a block (less than 100m) to the long black-sand beach at Perivolos. If you follow the road to the beach and turn right you’ll find many tavernas, restaurants, and few mini-marts along the beach road. Single room was small but reasonable sized for two. Furnishings were basic but in good condition and working order. This included a double bed, sink, refrigerator and complimentary large bottled water (more available for purchase from the bar), plates/glasses/coffee cup/hot-pot, dresser closet with in-room safe, wall-mounted TV, duct-less AC, and folding chair. Bathroom was small in size but clean and in good working order. There’s a sitting area with small table and chair right outside the room. Pool area is good sized with lounge chairs and shaded sitting areas scattered around the pool. A bar opens from the lobby to pool, and small tables are clustered under the lobby deck where most sit for breakfast. Complimentary computer use is available from the lobby though Wi-Fi is free and worked from the room. Breakfast is a simple buffet and costs extra so you might be better off just heading to the beach and grabbing something from the spots scattered along the beach road. Besides proximity to the beach, probably the best part of the stay were the staff, all of whom where cheerfully welcoming, friendly and helpful throughout. Enjoyed the relaxing, easy-going stay at Smaragdi Hotel and time spent along Perivolos beach.","September 17, 2017","2    Smaragdi Hotel

157,"We stayed at Smaragdi hotel for a week at the end of July and had a brilliant time. The hotel staff are all very helpful and friendly and we can't praise them enough. On our second night we found our room air conditioning was not quite working properly so we reported this to the manager and she immediately supplied us with a mega blaster fan which worked a treat and for the inconvenience we were given a 30 euro voucher to use on food or drink within the hotel, and then the air con was fixed the following day so all was good. We really appreciated the speed in which it was rectified and the kind gesture of the voucher. Our room was large and clean, and the beds were very comfortable and the bathroom shower was lovely. The pool and bar area is pretty and very well maintained. The long black sand beach is a very short walk and the area has some reasonably priced restaurants. We used the local bus service (cheap and regular service) to get to Fira and Oia and we would also recommend taking the local bus to Santo winery. Everywhere you turn there are spectacular views. I would highly recommend this hotel to family and friends and would love to return again in the future.","August 7, 2017","2    Smaragdi Hotel

The room was very modern, spacious, and best of all clean! The beds were comfortable and the rim had all the amenities needed. Staff were incredibly helpful (booked quads, brought anything we asked for to our room, organized transfers for us, etc. The pool and bar were also very clean and convenient. Upon checking out we had advised were headed up to Imerovigli for two more nights and were told that if for whatever reason we were back to the south of the island to stop in and feel welcome to use the pool and facilities.

164,"We stayed in the Cave Room. We had 5 people. There is one double bed in a secluded area with its private full bathroom. Then in the main area where there is a table/chairs, there were 2 twin sized beds and a cot for the 5th person. That area also has its own full bath. There was plenty of room of the 5 of us and the wifi worked fine (had some concerns since it is a cave!). The room was extremely clean! The cave room had 2 private outside sitting areas - one on the same level as the room entrance and a 2nd upper private balcony with 2 chaise loungers and a table. We could pick out our breakfast items the day before and the next morning our breakfast would be waiting for us on trays on our balcony. There were many selections and was a great Greek breakfast. What was the BEST was the view from the hotel. The sitting area (table / chairs / sun cover) for all guests was immediately adjacent to the cave room's upper balcony (this might be a problem for some people, but we didn't care) - but the view was MAGNIFICENT. Really one of the best views around. Just be forewarned that there are maybe 50 steps down to the hotel (which is not unusual) from the parking lot. We used Blue Dolphins transportation for the 5 of us in one vehicle; the only issue was the driver on the return trip to the airport was excessively fast (dangerously so) and it was a jerky ride while we had plenty of time to get to the airport. Blue Dolphins was a great location; very close walk to Fira (15-20 min) and 2.5 hour walk to Oia via the pathway. It is maybe a 15 minute walk to the area of Skaros Rock for fabulous sunset views. Or, you could just watch the sunset from the hotel! Very happy we stayed in Firostefani which was way less congested and much less touristy than Oia.","June 9, 2019","3    Blue Dolphins Apartments & Suites

165,"Our family can’t stop raving about our stay at Blue Dolphins. We stayed in the hideaway cave house and the canava cave house. Not only were the rooms big and spacious but definitely could fit more than the two people we had in each. The hideaway cave house is about a 10 min walk from the resort but they offered free shuttling back and forth for breakfast. The staff WAS AMAZING. They took care of getting us last minute ATV’s before our dinner, shuttling us to and from port even when our ferry was delayed till midnight, carrying our heavy luggage up and down the stairs. They were unbelievably accommodating! The breakfast was top notch we’re all still talking about the fresh orange juice and the incredible views. We always came back from our excursions with clean rooms. It is so close to shopping and great restaurants but far enough away from the cruise crowds. We can not recommend this place enough!

Breakfast was not included so we walked to Fira (about 20 minutes) every morning, which was good exercise. Great location.

167,"I travelled with my then 2 year old, Blue Dolphins was one only a handful of properties on the caldera side that allowed children. It was absolutely safe, albeit many stairs, a toddlers dream! Theodora and Dennis were very accommodating as my booking was last minute, I was able to secure the Honeymoon Jacuzzi suite which worked perfectly, and was great to wind down after a busy day out and a great opportunity for my little one to splash around and cool down from the Santorini sun! It was especially beautiful in the evening to sit and relax and watch the Fira lights sparkling and lighting up the night sky. This suite would be perfect for honeymooners, the views are to die for! The suite was spacious, I appreciate the big bathroom, the shower was great, huge balcony, the bed is a little on the uncomfortable side but I found this to be the case across Greece in general. I appreciated the simple but fresh breakfast, it’s no means a buffet, but fresh yoghurt, breads and pasteries, jams and honey’s and fresh fruit, fresh orange juice, all the makings for a great start to the day! The views from breakfast are incredible and one of my most memorable from my stay in Greece. I paid extra for a transfer, and the gentleman was fantastic, carried my bags and pram down all the many stairs. We arrived very early in the morning around 7;30am, they were very accommodating, had placed us in one of the downstairs rooms, so I could freshen up my son and set our belongings down until our room was ready. In the meantime I took a walk and hired a car and by the time we came back out room was ready and the boys working in the apartments were fantastic, transferred all our bags to the upper room and with a happy smile. I remember when we arrived and walked down the stairs to the property and I remember being gobsmacked when faced with the caldera view, it’s honestly unlike anything I’ve ever seen before. I highly recommend Blue Dolphins, it’s very clean, has some of the best views of the caldera and back into Fira. It’s a good location, within 10min walking distance to Fira, and a good location if you have a car, everything is easily accessible, if travelling with a stroller, I would use the back road sidewalk, as the rocky pathway that leads from Imerovigli to Fira is rocky all the way and not easy to travel down with a stroller. I used the sidewalk on the main road and cut into one of the side alleys in Fira closest to where I was going to be dining or visiting.","May 15, 2019","3    Blue Dolphins Apartments & Suites

The bathroom was really spacious, but the heating is limited to the ones from the heater plates, so you might feel cold during the non-summer times. The room is small, but cozy and the window offers a direct view of the Caldera. The reception is a bit hard to reach out physically, due to the several up and down staircases you have to take. The breakfast didn't offer too many choices and was limited to English breakfast primarily.

Upon our arrival we were informed we shall be staying in the beautiful Canava cave house and as well as the suite with the private balcony for the last night, so this was a nice surprise. Both rooms were unreal and the pictures speak for themselves really. The cleanliness was top notch. Breakfast was continental with a good variety to choose from. And what a beautiful view! Whether it is from the private balcony of either of the two rooms we stayed in, or from the terrace where breakfast is served, the view of the Caldera is just breathtaking. You can easily sit there for hours just admiring the view. The location is also quite perfect. Only about 15mins walk from the centre of Fira. The hotel is also conveniently located a few minutes walking distance from many restaurants, souvenier shops and convenience stores, as well as a bus stop where you can take a bus to the centre of Fira when it is too hot to walk around. A final and most important thing: the staff. Everyone was so friendly and extremely helpful in making our stay as comfortable and convenient as possible.

196,"Our first time in Santorini and we absolutely loved this hotel! It was perfectly located as it was a lovey 15-20min walk to Fira, probably quicker than that if you didn’t keep stopping to take in the views. It was notas bustling as Fira, just how we like it, but enough restaurants and shops around for convenience. We hired an ATV, highly recommended, and travelled around the island on this, Oia was just about 20mins away on the ATV. There was always parking for us at the hotel.WiFi was fine I could even video call. We felt the hotel had the best views! And very private unlike the hotels in Oia and Imergovili that we walked by. We could see a great sunset from our romantic suite and also walked to a square in Imergovili to see the sunset on one night. The staff were super friendly and informative especially Theo who did everything to make our stay comfortable and special ! She was very prompt at responding to my emails and even better in person ! She made our trip extremely special with recommendations, booking us tours and even making dinner reservations. Very professional and helpful :)There’s no communal pool at the hotel but who needs to sit in a pool when you have a beautiful island to explore !?

Rooms were clean and spacious . The location is at a walking distance from Fira and the bus station there and has many good restaurants nearby . Special mention to the Blue Dolphin staff Dora who was very helpful in explaining the details of the when/ where to go and also for booking and following up on our wine tasting. First taste of Greek coffee( which was later enjoined through the Greece trip) was what she made for us.. They also have a nice pamphlet giving details of the places near( restaurants , transportation etc) which came in very handy.

208,"This was the best little gem we could have hoped for in Santorini. Let me get the cons out of the way so I can tell you about all the great stuff! Cons: 1) limited parking shared with another hotel (Hotel Ira). blue dolphin is just behind this one - which makes it a little difficult to find if using GPS. 2) So. Many. Stairs. To get to the reception area and breakfast area, you have to descend what seems like a mountain of stairs, then go up some more stairs until you get to where you need to be. No bueno, but I guess it can’t be helped. 3) If you get a room on the main floor, you will hear every single thing. I heard people talking, closing doors, and even urinating in the rooms above. Rooms on this floor also don’t have the best views and are a little less private ( people walking by your room all the time). Fortunately, we had booked two separate reservations so the next night we moved to the honeymoon suite which allows me to leave the BEST list of pros!!!.....PROS:1) If you can get a suite, DO IT! We had a private balcony with a private hot tub and sun deck overlooking the caldera and santorini rooftops. It was magically glorious. Our room was huge with a morning view of the Aegean Sea and the biggest shower I’ve ever had in my life. The products they provide smell so good and are just sublime. It made this trip so relaxing. Bonus= less stairs to get to our room!!!!! 2) Morning Breakfast included everyday ( it’s the same breakfast, but you can ask to have more or less of something that you really liked).3) Friendly staff! So very nice and accommodating and willing to answer any questions you have about the island and even about the products they have! 4) This could be a pro or con for you depending on whether or not you love cats BUT we had breakfast every morning with a torty colored kitty that we named Fira. I think she’s a local cat that just hangs out on the property, but she’s there every morning ( and sometimes evening) waiting for some handouts. ( I bought some dry cat food from the local supermarket so that she could have a full meal and could leave me my ham!) I miss her already. ","March 18, 2018","3    Blue Dolphins Apartments & Suites

209,"There are a ton of hotels and apartments in Santorini and it is hard to pick a place. We traveled late in the season and lots of places were already closed, but we were glad that this place stayed open late in the season. The views are amazing, the breakfast was delicious. Our shuttle from the port to the hotel was well worth the cost and our driver even took our luggage to the reception area, which I might add had lots of stairs up and down and would have been a tremendous workout. I think of hotels on the scale of would I go there again and while I would try a different spot on my next trip, I wouldn't mind staying here again. Consider having the hotel call to get you a quad to rent, they made the renting process easy and you can't beat getting picked up by the company to get your rental.","March 3, 2018","3    Blue Dolphins Apartments & Suites

215,What a great find! This place offers incredible value for the price. Valseles (sp?) was so friendly as we arrived at 7am before the town was awake but he was here starting to clean up for the day and gave my wife and I a room to nap in until breakfast was served and we could speak to a receptionist. Keep in mind this is a small town feel more like an inn or bnb but that’s what makes the experience. He then invited us for breakfast even though we were not checked in which was nice. Shen they were ready Dennis checked us in way early as a room was opened up early. The best part was that they wanted to get us in a room early so they put us in an upgraded room (standard to cave) but the best part was that they said they would put us in a private villa house on our last night.

The staff at the front desk were so helpful in providing information on the island, restaurants to visit, etc. They also helped us arrange a taxi on our last morning to take us to the airport.The room we had was a cave style and was really unique. Clean and comfortable, we had no complaints. Breakfast was included and was very good as well! On our last morning, we had to leave very early, but the staff went above and beyond by leaving breakfast in our fridge for us the night before. The best part about this hotel was the view! Situated cliffside, you have an amazing view of the caldera.Highly recommend this hotel if you are staying in Fira!","July 14, 2019","4    Hotel Kavalari

It has an amazing sunset/city view, a fantastic pool, and very friendly/helpful staff who go above and beyond to help travelers (esp. the owner, bartender, and office staff) The rooms were nice and clean. Beach/rustic as described previously.

Location is on the very center of the Fira, and it was only couple of minutes walk to the main street and the the restaurants, bars etc. We had a room with balcony with caldera view, and the sunset was just spectacular. Hotel rooms and facilities are not new, but clean and hotel has nice style which we loved.

We were met by Lorenzo who guided us through the throngs of people to get us to the hotel. Dimitri at checkin was courteous, polite and very helpful. Our room was at the top of the hotel and had awe inspiring views. A small bottle of wine was provided on our arrival. Our main reason for visiting Santorini was to (hopefully) catch a sunset. We were not disappointed. We got some stunning photographs and will cherish the memories forever.","June 6, 2019","4    Hotel Kavalari

The cave rooms are charming, we had room 12 with our two teen daughters which had two separated living areas and a private court yard with beautiful flora and fauna looking out over the caldera!!! The staff were all so hard working and super kind. They never seemed to leave the hotel-and always were smiling-unbelievable. This is not a hotel for people who have mobility concerns, or who desire a modern posh decor. This is a romantic, quirky place with breathtaking views (I think the best on the island after exploring most of it). As a traveler to 29 countries, this has been one of the best places we have ever stayed. We highly recommend early to mid April to avoid the crowds, and to enjoy a peaceful sunset on your own terrace! ","April 13, 2019","4    Hotel Kavalari

223,"Hello,The staff were wonderful, the view even better, the breakfast hearty. The room pretty ok, bathroom less so (tiny, dark).My main concern is with the lack of safety on one set of wide, sloping outside steps when wet that resulted in serious injury for me. The management had posted a sign about hazardous when wet, so I knew it, and was purposefully stepping carefully, with my R hand on the railing; wearing flat walking shoes. Despite all this, after a rain, my ankle torqued on the step, and that was all it took. I came home to find I had not a sprained ankle, but one in which many bones were broken, necessitating major surgery and months of recuperation, not to mention money! Now, could some of the breakage be due to poor bone health? Possibly. But who wants to incur even a sprained ankle on vacation? (And, someone older than myself might have pitched down the stairs when their ankle torqued, resulting in worse injury.)I have written the hotel management twice recommending that the design and construction of these steps be improved on. No response back, thus this reluctant review, b/c I feel people need to know. The steps I fell on have this problem: they are painted (so surface more slippery); they are slightly cratered, so grip not as sure; and, they tilt somewhat downward. All this combines to make them very hazardous when wet. I loved the hotel personnel, so don't want to put their jobs at risk. But, after no reply from the owner, I feel I need to warn folks. If you go, be VERY, VERY careful on those steps when wet.","January 11, 2019","4    Hotel Kavalari

The front desk staff was awesome and was very helpful. Only drawback was the bellhop we nicknamed Lurch. I think he was trying to impress us with how strong he was when taking our bags to the room. He didn't like us much from the moment he came to get our bags. No eye contact, grunted and pointed when we asked questions. It was comical and we took it in stride because everything else there was perfect. I recommend this hotel highly even if Lurch was cranky.","October 31, 2018","4    Hotel Kavalari

Don't expect a 4 star hotel based on the american standarts but it is clean and rates are very good.

I am sure this is not unusual, as there are many other hotels built on the cliffs, but those with health issues should just be warned. The views are amazing! The rooms are a bit quirky, like having to turn on a boiler 15 minutes before using the shower and not being able to flush toilet paper. But this is a small island with limited resources, so patience should be considered. WiFi is limited, we could only get it outside.","September 14, 2018","4    Hotel Kavalari

It is located in one of the best spots with all restaurants and bars a few steps away. The sunset view was gorgeous and one of the best places to watch it from our balcony.

Sometimes it seems they can read your thoughts and fulfill your wishes like the magicians If you want to avoid too many stairs as well as moldy room and if you are someone who likes to enjoy at your own balcony I strongly recommend Superior room with Caldera view.

Upon our arrival, the hotel was very accommodating in holding our luggage until checkin - much appreciated. The room had an amazing view of the Caldera and Santorini. During the day, we enjoyed the hotel very much. It was quiet with exceptional views and access to all the shops/dining in Fira. But at night, all that tranquility was replaced with loud disco music. We couldn't sleep. And the AC, more like a dehumidifier, was inadequate. Our room, especially the bathroom, had visible black mold and smelled along with the smell of sewage. What a shame!

Friendly staff are another bonus, but you will not get: quiet (near clubs and busy balconies with guests moving around at all hours), toilet where paper can be flushed, water pressure, or easy access as there are a lot of steps. Breakfast service will take more than 30 minutes, just to get the attention of someone. Think twice...Will you sit on the balcony and enjoy the view for hours or could you do that at a nice restaurant?And, consider having a pool...","July 10, 2018","4    Hotel Kavalari

233,"Really great hotel with smiley/friendly staff In such a perfect and easy location - up the stairs from the lobby takes you to one of the Main Streets (picture 1) with clear, open views of the sun, sunset, sea, caldera, Thirasia and part of Oia too. Very beautiful views from all angles of the hotel too; especially from our superior double room with caldera views (pictures 6-10)Every time we opened our room door we said ‘wow’, and every time we came down the steps (5th picture) from the lobby to our balcony we were in awe of the views. Really couldn’t get enough of the views!We sat at our balcony every single morning/afternoon and evening. Whenever we were back at the hotel we were sitting there.Much preferred our views here than we did in Oia.Our room was white, clean and more spacious than it appears from the the pictures the hotel provides. Unfortunately I never took any pictures of the room. But it opened into a wide open bedroom/sitting area. Straight in front of the door were the beds next to each other both with mini tables either side and spotlights behind the beds. To the right alongside the wall is a wardrobe. And behind that is a door leading to the bathroom. The bathroom was fairly small in comparison but enough to do what you needed to use it for. The shower is a little basic and requires waiting for hot water before using it but the temperature of the water we had was more than ideal considering the very hot weather outside Back in the main room, to the very left of the room door is a corner sofa/sofa bed with a tv on a cupboard containing a fridge. Soft drinks and water were provided in the fridge (at a small price) but better to have them to hand than not at all. We did have some and it was very cheap anyway. Next to the sofa there was a vanity table with plates/mugs and kettle too. The room has Air conditioning as well as a fan/light on the ceiling in the middle of the room.The hotel is approximately a 5 minutes walk to the main bus stop in Fira as well as the local taxi rank for easy travel. The hotel staff are also more than happy to arrange your travel for you if you prefer. They provide you with a map and a hotel leaflet as soon as you check in. The leaflet provides information on top excursions and the staff are more than happy to give you their recommendations of tips. We didn’t get to try out the excursions due to pre planned days out but if we had more time we definitely would have.Despite the location, it isn’t noisy or uncomfortably loud. There was a bar/restaurant to the above/to the left of our room/balcony which you could sometimes hear the music if you were sitting at the balcony but it wasn’t overbearing or annoying at allThe hotel restaurant for breakfast (from 8am) was 2 levels below us, if we peered over our balcony we could see the tables set out overlooking the sea/caldera. We never got round to trying breakfast there unfortunately as we were always up and out early morning.Only downside was that WiFi/signal could be very temperamental at the hotel. At times it worked fine and offers we couldn’t use anything, especially in the room itself. The WiFi was better on the balcony as the hotel assures you anyway. But considering you don’t spend a great deal of time in the room as you explore Santorini it wasn’t a deal breaker. Just needs improving (that was our only reason for 4/5 stars)We would definitely return to this hotel/location if we were to visit Santorini again. ","July 9, 2018","4    Hotel Kavalari

From the hotel entrance you are within easy walking distance to shops, restaurants, and the bus station.There are a lot of stairs to get down to your room, but this is average for the caldera hotels and worth it for the views. Speaking of views, you don't need to bother getting a room with a private balcony here. The multi-level patio/balcony/terrace of the hotel is amazing. There are different levels and seat groupings, so if you want to sit and enjoy a glass of wine at sunset, you can find a spot with relative privacy.My room was spacious and included a closet, iron, ironing board, vanity, and a built in couch. The air conditioning and lights are controlled by your key card (as with many hotels in Greece). This can be inconvenient if it's extremely hot since you will come back to a warm room. But we found that it cooled down quickly.Breakfast is served on the terrace. It was a great meal - meat and cheese plate, yogurt, fresh cut fruit, fresh juice, and a basket of breads and spanakopita.I would definitely stay here again if I return to Santorini.","February 7, 2018","4    Hotel Kavalari

The Hotel Kavalari arranged our transfers from the airport to the hotel and from the hotel to the port. Because the hotel is in an non-accessible vehicle location, the hotel had a staff person meet us at the end of the street and take our luggage to the hotel. He then carried our luggage to our hotel room which was located many steps down from the main street. Our room, #14, was wonderful. It overlooked the sea which a patio balcony. We had twin beds, which we requested, and the room was spotless. We had a cave room and the experience was very memorable. Breakfast, located on the patio overlooking the sea, was included and it was delicious. Service was wonderful.

249,"As a solo traveller I am always looking for somewhere that feels like home. Hotel Kavalari is just that. The staff are warm, exceptionally helpful and genuinely hospitable. The view is staggering. The location is perfect as it is central to everything. This isn't one of the high end hotels but it is incredibly well priced for the service and facilities. Maria, in particular, felt like a sister to me and I looked forward to our morning chat every day before each adventure. Such a sweet hotel. ","July 22, 2017","4    Hotel Kavalari

251,"The hotel has amazing view, one can see that even from the room. The location is great as in it is near to bus stand and car/taxi can also come till hotel atlantis, which just 2 minutes from the hotel. from there the hotel guy come for pickup. For any other hotel which is in between fira and imerovigli one may needs to walk alot and that is on slop. Also the super markets and other souvenir shops are nearby. The hotel do not have kitchen so you cant get anything other than breakfast. I think most of the hotel there do not have kitchen as there are so many nice restaurants around.The staff is very helpful - (Dimitris, Marina). They have kettle in room but they do not refill tea/coffee.","June 20, 2017","4    Hotel Kavalari

258,"The first person most of us meet when staying at a hotel is the reception clerk. Maria checked me in and she is the reason my rating is 4 stars rather than 3 or 3.5 stars. Personable and helpful, Maria is an asset to the hotel.The hotel is located on ""Gold Street"" and overlooks the water. The positive is that the guest has a fantastic view of the sea. The negative is that the guest has to negotiate steep stairs, the kind that can cause heart attacks.My room was, at first glance, a disappointment; in fact I compared it in my mind to monks' chambers. But after I saw the bathroom, I fell in love.While breakfast is not buffet style, it is both tasty and more than adequate. However it is unchanging which leads to ennui.Several things which, if they had been provided, would have improved the quality of my stay: 1- a laundry bag, 2- facial tissues 3- a washcloth","May 3, 2017","4    Hotel Kavalari

265,"After having visited Santorini many times and always promising myself a stay at the Kavalari …finally made it! Possible the best views on the Island , beautifully maintained property in traditional Cycladic architecture. We were lucky enough to stay in one of the Cave Apartments which really did make our stay better than anticipated. Huge living space , enough for a family of four , seating area , dining area, separate sleeping area and a wonderful shower. Couldn ‘t have asked for more. The terraces were wonderfully maintained , and the views are spectacular from every part of the hotel no matter which terrace you stay at .Owing to the nature of the place itself , would not recommend for anyone who is not so mobile/fit, or is scared of heights as there are many steps around the property. The steps however are wide and clearly marked so its not a big problem. This review would not be complete with a well deserved praise for the breakfast – absolutely stunning setting and beautifully presented with fresh greek yoghurt and freshly squeezed juice every morning, along with pastries , cold cuts and tea and coffee. I would def stay there again for sure , the staff especially Maria were wonderful and welcoming and very helpful in every way.","October 25, 2016","4    Hotel Kavalari

266,"So we came to Santorini via the 9:00 am Highspeed 7 Ferry from Heraklion. I had informed the hotel in advance that I'll be arriving before the official check-in time of 2 pm. When we reached the hotel, it was around 12:40 +/- 10 mins. We requested for a early check-in. The receptionist, named Maria, refused. We had a pickup for our Sailing Trip at 1:35, and we needed to freshen up, having started our day early, so we requested again and she refused us rudely. Its understandable if the room is not ready at 12:45 .. all we wanted was that we have access to the bathroom, and they can cleanup later, but her attitude was stone cold and haughty. She didnt allow us to check out the room she would be giving us either.Anyway, we come back from our sailing trip around 7 pm and guess what : she gave us a TWIN BED ROOM. WHO GIVES A COUPLE ON A HONEYMOON A TWIN BED ROOM. This really put us off. Luckily she wasnt around, there was another receptionist and he was good enough and he changed the room. Never mind that the room had no balcony, as promised, the fan creaked throughout the night (it was switched off) for reasons we couldnt fathom, but this receptionist was helpful overall and we felt he did the best he could.Finally we check out after 2 days, and at 11:55 am we get a call from the horrible receptionist asking us our checkout time. We said we want 20 minutes, and her reply was ""You should know the rules. If you stay any extra, it would be chargeable"". IS SHE WORKING IN A HOTEL OR THE GOVERNMENT ? We were not ready, and honestly pissed off, but thought its best to leave quitely and asap.I could clearly see that other guests were not treated the same way. People were checking out at 12:30, 1 etc., and being Asian, I know what this means. They should clearly say people of so-and-so countries are not welcome.All other hotels in Greece treated us superbly I must say. We got free room upgrades, complementary wine as we were on our honeymoon from all of them. It not that we expected this from this hotel, or we should have expected, but a basic decency and courtesy goes a long way. Its a hygiene factor. The experience here left a better taste in our mouth.Apart from the receptionist. things were good at the hotel. The bell-boy and the breakfast waiter were excellent and kind. The hotel has nice interiors and its priced ok. One minor negative was that the room had no ventilation and had a musty smell about it.Final word: IF YOU ARE ASIAN, AVOID THIS !","October 24, 2016","4    Hotel Kavalari

268,"This hotel offered warm and friendly service but it's most advantageous attraction is its location. It is perched way above the uniquely tiered undulating clifftops of Santorini. It is wow factor material indeed! The staff were fantastic and saw to our every need. However, the rooms are very dated, including the bathrooms, which were very old and pokey. The door to the mini bar fell off when we tried to open it. If they updated this very tired property, it would be magnificent. From that perspective, I didn't think it was value for money. Whilst I accept this is a fantastic, bucket-list destination, I do think it is a slight rip off to charge top rates for a property that doesn't deliver. If it were not for the staff, I would have been very disappointed. My recommendation? Upgrade your rooms and I'll return!!!!","October 6, 2016","4    Hotel Kavalari

270,"The hotel is situated between Oil and Fira which is just great! The location of the hotel offers breathtaking views! The hotel offered us peace and tranquility. It was a refreshing place to stay after spending time in the more crowded areas in the island. Their daily breakfast was also a nice treat to wake up to each morning. The only reason for not providing an overall rating of 5 stars was just on the format of the room given that it is a 5 star rated hotel. It was a bit odd having a bed that was adjacent to the wall and having to jump over to get out of the bed to use the restroom, it felt a bit confining. That was the only minor feedback, we had an amazing time there and would recommend staying at the hotel! The staff really makes you feel at home and welcomed!

Santorini is full of great places where to stay but the Santorini Princess has something unique: the atmosphere and the amazing staff. From the reception, to the restaurant, to the General Manager, to the cleaners, a genuine sense of hospitality, they make you feel at home. Its location is also special: close enough to Oia, Imerovigli town, Fira, but away from the crowd and tourists passing by and looking into your patio.

272,"Before writing about the property, where to stay in Santorini was a challenging task. Oia has all iconic picture postcard pics but even in good resorts there is no privacy, Fira is vibrant with cafes but similar problem of tourists all around your hotel. Hence I chose Imerovigli. Coming to Santorni princess, I have reviewed over 40 hotels all across the globe but never had this strange feeling of belongingness as in this property. The moment you step in you are treated as a family member. We reached 3 hrs before check in time, we were taken to their restaurant served juices, wine, cut fruit. I stayed in quadruple room , room has a huge living room, 2 bed rooms, 2 washrooms, a sit out with beautiful view of sea & Caldera. Safe deposit box has conventional key, the electronic system has been disconnected. Perfect housekeeping, restaurant has nice view, I had requested for gluten free bread & there it was. In room dining was good so was the dinner. Transfer service to Fira, Oia is provided by hotel at reasonable charge. That's a huge plus point in Santorini, you give a call & there the hotel van will be there. It's cheaper than any taxi. Manager greets and inquires about your requirements. But the central point is Georgia, a bundle of energy who takes care of everything. What's bad in Santorini Princess, well it's saying good bye. This feeling I never had in any hotel all across the globe.If you are visiting Santorni, don't search too much , just grab the available room. ","July 11, 2019","5    Santorini Princess

276,"I never write reviews, but the Santorini Princess Hotel exceeded our expectations so much that it seemed necessary. The views from the hotel were absolutely amazing. We ventured to Fira, Imerovigli, and Oia, but the best views (especially sunset) were from the hotel. Every staff member goes above and beyond. With delicious beverages, and daily sweet surprises/souvenirs in our room, they truly go the extra mile. On the last day of our stay, at the pool, a very strong wind gust came in briefly and whisked my sarong high into the air and far away. Everyone watched as the wind carried it away and I was devastated to lose one of my favorite items of clothing. I accepted it was gone, but then 4-5 of the staff members grouped together to try and find it, and one of them climbed down a very steep hill to retrieve it!!! I had not even asked them to, as I knew it would be very difficult to get to. They worked so hard to get it for me, and even took extra time after to make sure it was clean and folded it up to give back to me. This is just one example of their next level service and care.

278,"Wow - where do I start with this fantastic destination. Prior to our arrival Amy and I were given a free upgrade to the Presidential Suites in Akrotiri which if you get the chance to go it’s a must. The accommodation is a private villa with its own pool and hot tub along with unbelievable views across the Caldera. Corinna who is the manager and all her staff were absolutely first class and we wanted for nothing. They are all very attentive and nothing is too much trouble. The service we had whilst there (3 nights) was just great. The villa itself was spotless and included a gym and lounge area. Our food which was served in our villa was very good and our breakfast (which was pre ordered the night before) was brought to us at our time of choice by the staff.We did have a slight accounting issue between the Presidential Suites and the hotel but this was more than made up for by the offer of free drinks and massages.We were then transferred free of charge to the hotel which is situated in the North of the island close to Imerovigli. Again on our arrival at the hotel the staff were amazing and we were given a tour of the place and also a gree glass of wine and chocolate, which I thought was a very nice gesture.Whilst at the hotel we ate in the restaurant and the food was excellent with lots of choice. The staff were very knowledgable and were really proud of promoting local food and wine. We are twice in the restaurant and couldn’t fault anything - again we were offered free bottles of wine.The staff also recommended other places to eat and see. The hotel has 3 shuttle vehicles and for a small fee they will take you anywhere on the island. We visited Oia which is very busy with narrow streets - if you do go there avoid the days when the cruise ships dock as it does get extremely crowded. It is a must visit though. Take the steps down to Amoudi bay where you can get some amazing fish dishes at the restaurants.We walked the costal route back to our hotel which is well worth it as the views across the Caldera are stunning. It is about 6 miles so take plenty of water if you do decide to do this.On the recommendation of the hotel we ate at other restaurants (Lefkes in Finikia which was on the walk back from Oia) fantastic food and also Aegean in Imerovigli which had views across the Caldera with a stunning sunset.We also did the sunset Catamaran boat trip which was a tad expensive but again our crew made the trip for us as they we very knowledgeable. The food they served as well was fabulous. Again we saw a fantastic sunset anchored out at sea.I would like to give a special mention to Corrina who is the manager at the Presidential Suites and to Mr Vious, the manager at the Spa hotel along with Georgia who we’re unbelievably kind to us whilst we were there.It is a place we will definitely return to and can’t recommend it highly enough. Everyone who works there are a credit to the the hotel.A massive thank you from Amy and myself and hope to see you in the near future.","June 17, 2019","5    Santorini Princess

279,"Myself and wife researched for 6 months for a destination/hotel for our honeymoon. We finally settled on one of two hotels on Santorini over 10 days. We choose the Santorini Princess based on reviews and didn't make the wrong decision. We had to pay for it though! Santorini is very expensive...but worth it.. I am a fussy traveller and tend to write negative reviews of hotels. I have nothing to be negative about here. The Santorini Princess is excellent! We stayed for 6 nights in the honeymoon suite. We were welcomed by a driver from the hotel who was really friendly (recommend a pickup rather than taxi) starting the honeymoon on a positive note as we were very tired. On arrival we were met with amazing views across the caldera. The reception staff were very welcoming, friendly and provided welcome cool drinks. This was followed by a tour, Kir Royale's and chocolate pudding. Our bags were taken to our room and we had roses waiting for us. The Honey Moon suite was spotless, cleaning excellent. Nice towels and products provided. The suite Hot Tub/Jacuzzi wasn't really powerful and I dint use it much but was nice enough. View was great though the general 'public' can walk past underneath the room on the main road and see the room its not 'overlooked'. 4 poster bed was comfortable as were pillows. The room was cleaned throughout the day....cleaning staff were very attentive. The Hotel is located a 15 minute walk up hill to the nearest 'town' where there is plenty of restaurants. We also walked to Oia from the hotel (recommend the hike but take plenty of water)...you need to be fairly fit to do all the walking in the sun, in my opinion. We did a catamaran boat trip from the hotel for 135 Euro's each which is a complete rip off but again Santorini is expensive and its a once in a life time for us. I am glad we did it but it was nothing outstanding. The staff were all amazing throughout, polite, professional and went beyond required. The little things made the difference here, some free crisps or a glass of wine after a trip late at night. The free 'tat' provided to us each day was actually a nice touch and some of it was really nice. e.g. Santorini apron/fridge magnet. The staff really were 'on it' the whole time, no let up. Credit to them. We ate most days at the on site restaurant for breakfast/lunch/dinner. I am vegetarian and was well catered for. It was reasonably priced, similar to most restaurants in Santorini which is generally really expensive. I wouldn't pay the prices establishments in Santorini charge at home! Service was excellent most days, however sometimes they seemed less attentive than other days....being picky here though. We used room service a few times which was nice. We were hoping to get a cheeky free drink on our last night but didn't :P Seems like you may need to be speaking to the right person at the right time. The pool was warm and heated...really nice. The Spa area we had a 30 minute free session. The Spa itself is pretty average. Standard Sauna and small hot tub. Didn't have a massage as cost to much. There were plenty of sunbeds and little private areas to sunbathe, staff bring towels (a nice touch) and free drinks now and again. If I could change anything? Maybe full reclining sunbeds in the room balcony's, soft closing toilet seats and better jets in the hot tub. Breakfast on the balcony with a room order card would be a nice touch...I am really digging for things here though... Summing up....I have never had the level of service in any hotel across the world that I had at Santorini Princess. The other hotel we stayed at was nice but not as nice as the Princess due to the service received from staff. My Wife and I will always have the Santorini Princess in our minds as a bench mark to beat. Well done, amazing!!!

280,"I have just concluded a seven night stay at this hotel with 10 girlfriends, all of whom traveled from around the US to Greece to celebrate one of our 50th birthdays. The stay was pretty flawless from beginning to end. A few highlights:1) Location, location, location. IMO, the location was ideal and I would definitely stay here if I return to Santorini. The views from everywhere - the room, the pool, the restaurant - are spectacular. You have the feeling of floating in the clouds as you look out upon endless blue, framed by breathtaking cliffs dotted with white and blue buildings. The hotel, in Imerovigli, is centrally located between the various other towns. Moreover, we went into various towns (Fira, Oia) and found them absolutely loaded with cruisers and tourists, and at the end of each day came back to this oasis of calm, peacefulness, and serenity. You could practically hear a pin drop laying by the pool or sitting on our porches at night.2) Service. I have stayed in many five-star hotels and this hotel delivers on what you would expect from such a property. However, beyond the efficiency, promptness, and accuracy in responding to every request of our group of 11 throughout our stay, the service was strikingly warm, gracious, and very personal. Roses in our room when we came home each night. Gifts on our pillows. Special drinks poolside with ice encrusted towels. Do I have to go home? We had the feeling of celebrating the birthday week with extended family. The staff even took the initiative to prepare a cake, and to gather with balloons, and champagne for a surprise rendition of happy birthday in English and in Greek for our friend. While everyone went above and beyond, we must call out special praise for Georgia, our concierge, who was simply exceptional. Wow. A very memorable person. She choreographed the week with impeccable taste in each reservation and suggestion, always with a smile.3) Property- The hotel itself is well maintained, well laid-out, and very comfortable. The rooms are all very nice. The restaurant, pool, spa, and grounds are all lovely. Breakfast buffet is great.Overall this was a 5* experience from check-in to check-out. I wholeheartedly recommend this place. It has provided me, and our entire group, with precious memories of a first-rate experience for a milestone birthday. I am personally very grateful - thank you, Santorini Princess to you and your entire staff who made our visit to Greece perfection.","June 14, 2019","5    Santorini Princess

281,"Incredible! The service was out of this world! We've stayed at some great hotels (Four Seasons, Mandarin Oriental, St. Regis, and some great boutique hotels) - but this was the best. And Romina! She is the star. Whoever is the owner should pay her double, at least! Rooms are clean, beautiful, quiet. The hotel is not in one of the towns - but both Oia and Fira are easy to get to.

This was the most fabulous stay we have ever had anywhere in the world. The customer service level is so superior to anything I have ever experienced. Vaios , Georgia, Sophia, Yanos, and Romina all made it a fantastic experience. The pool was beautiful, the restaurant was excellent, and the location was perfect. We were completely away from the mass of humanity in Fira and Oia. If we wanted to go there we could at the drop of a hat. There was always a car waiting to take us anywhere we wanted to go. Oh, the sunsets were the best, too!You will not be disappointed at the Santorini Princess! Thanks for the great stay!","June 5, 2019","5    Santorini Princess

283,"I hope I can convey how wonderful this hotel is. The views of the caldera are unmatched, our room with its balcony and its breathtaking views was beautiful and comfortable, the staff was absolutely amazing in how attentive, professional and personable they were and the food in their restaurant was delicious and it also had stunning views. This boutique hotel located right on the edge of the caldera is beautiful but the staff added equally to the fantastic experience we had at this hotel. It was their pleasure to do whatever they could to make our vacation the best experience. Our flight went out very early the morning we left and they arranged a wonderful breakfast to be delivered to our room that morning before we left. A beautiful hotel matters but all the little details add up to an exceptional experience. Special thank-you to Georgia. You made such a difference.

284,"The beauty about this hotel is the staff, location and views. The moment you step down you are greeted warmly and are made to feel special and most welcome. Georgina was amazing, so was the food and beverage manager Yanni who was hands on, most attentive and most caring. Vayo the general manager was also warm and hospitable We stayed at villa number 22 which consisted of two bedrooms, 2 separate closets, 2 bathrooms and living/dining room which gives you enough space, total privacy and independence. The architecture is old style, with 2 small narrow windows, (imagine if this was a large glass French door instead in line with modern architecture to reveal the beautiful scenery outside). Nevertheless, the room has a great scenic location, terrace offers a breathtaking view of the sea, sunrise and sunset. The staff pamper you the moment you check in. We were treated very special, like royalty from beginning to end. As soon as we checked into our room, we were treated to a delicious slice of chocolate cake, along with other small treats regularly and on daily basis throughout your stay. Our daily activities, restaurant bookings and recommendations were properly organised for us by the Georgina and the food and beverage manager Yanni. The location of this hotel is most convenient because it has easy accessibility to all the trekking/hiking sites. The breakfast was good, although Greek specialties could have been tastier, healthier and more appetising. We brought this to the attention of Yanni who immediately took on board all our points, to ensure improvement. On the other hand, Sophie the maître D’ fulfilled my requests on daily basis, ensured that I get my mixed salad and bowl of fresh berries for breakfast on daily basis. The staff bent backwards and forwards to please us. Yanni, the food and beverage manager generously offered us free of charge very tasty Greek nibbles by the pool. On our last day of checking out, a special surprise lunch was prepared for us by Yanni which consisted of delicious fresh red mullet, sea bass, including other specialties of the house. Our stay at this hotel was a memorable experience, not be missed. We used the spa twice, excellent professional massage. Highly recommended hotel. It’s a must. It certainly deserves its certificate of excellence.","May 31, 2019","5    Santorini Princess

286,"My wife and I spent 5 nights at Santorini Princess and loved every bit of our stay. I had pre-booked through American Express, and found Santorini Princess to be well priced compared to some of the surrounding properties. While they were far more reasonably priced, Santorini Princess did not skimp on service. Georgia, Viaos, and the entire team at Santorini Princess go out of their way to attend to the guests and make you feel welcome. From suggestions on what to do, where to eat, to simply asking if they can get you anything, you will feel appreciated. Every night when we returned to our room there was a small gift waiting for us. I have only experienced this level of attention at one other property out of thousands I have visited.The rooms are spacious and comfortable as well. Our balcony was not as private as others, as we were right next to the pool. That being said the noise from the pool area was never a problem, and it was still relaxing sitting out and drinking a cup of coffee. (If you want more privacy, rooms 12 and 14 face the pool so request different rooms).The location of the property is perfect for watching the sunset over Oia. It is about a 25 minute walk into Thira where there are plenty of restaurants as well. ","May 27, 2019","5    Santorini Princess

287,"My husband and I just spent a night at this beautiful hotel! We were picked up promptly at the port by the hotels transfer services who were much more reasonable compared to the regular taxis. Upon our arrival, we were immediately greeted by the friendly staff and taken on a small tour of the hotel. Our room was very cute and clean, and the view from our balcony was amazing! Shortly after getting to our room, a staff member brought us some chocolate cake garnished with crushed pistachio and it was simply out of this world! We especially enjoyed the heated pool and regret not using the spa services as we were short on time, but the prices were very reasonable. Breakfast did not disappoint either, many great food options to choose from. We also used the transfer services to venture out in Fira at night and it was great - more reasonable than a local taxi. Aside from the property, the best part was the exceptional staff. Id like to specifically mention Maria, Romina and Georgia for their friendly helpfullness. They went above and beyond to make sure everything was to our liking and even gave us some great recommendations. Georigia really went out of her way to help us plan some activities and made some great suggestions for us. In the short time we spent together her she really left a great impression and it felt as if we had known eachother for so long. Unfortunately, we only stayed at this hotel for one short night then went elsewhere to join our family. If we could do it all over again we would stay at Santorini Princess with our family for the entire duration because the personable treatment we received by them was unmatched anywhere else! All in all, this is the perfect place to stay while visiting Santorini as it is quiet and tucked away from the busy touristy areas of Oia or Fira. You will not regret choosing Santorini Princess and their top-notch staff!","May 26, 2019","5    Santorini Princess

The manager Vaios and his assistant manager Georgia provided the best service you could ask for. Upon arriving, my wife felt dizzy from the car ride across the island, and the staff immediately found a place for her to relax, took us to a pharmacy, and everything was immediately better.Over the next couple days, Vaios, Georgia, and their team provided the best hotel service we have ever experienced. It felt like visiting your best friends. They were very personable, and always looking for ways to provide us a perfect stay including drinks, food, room service, local area recommendations, and a genuine interest in us.We also enjoyed the location, as it is in a perfect place for taking an amazing hike to both Oia and Fira with stunning views along the way.

290,"I don't generally write reviews but when I do, it's either because you suck or you're amazing. In this instance, I have to say, Santorini Princes Hotel has been amazing. The staffs are super friendly, approachable, and very helpful. I have to admit though .. I didn't have high expectations after a reservation snafu, however the reservation department offered a one night stay in Fira at a penthouse (same management). The pictures looked amazing but the check in process was torturous - everyone just waited in the beaming sun. I also felt so bad for the luggage carrier carrying all those luggages down those steps in the heat (i sincerely hope the other individuals tipped him well). Luckily our room was ready for early check in so we suffered slightly less but nonetheless not a good impression. Not to mention the transfer shuttle was over packed! There was a group that didn't even have a seat and literally had to squeeze so yeah... Didn't start off great. I didn't love the penthouse that much but did love the rooftop deck with the hot tub and sun bathing area. At Santorini Princess, the staffs right away started assisting us and making sure we actually felt like we're on vacation (basically anything that makes our lives easier). While the staffs are friendly, I was a little uneasy at how friendly they are... They're like over the top happy and friendly, which if you're like me, from nyc, yeah, it's a little much. The rooms are very clean and they even give you welcome drinks and dessert (loved the chocolate cake). I almost forgot but they even give you a little Santorini souvenir at the end of your stay. While the room is generally not my style, I think the top notch service overrides everything. The heated pool is also great especially if you came when it was a little chilly and and windy. The only gripe I had is the huge step you need to take when you leave your bed. I use the bathroom quite a bit at night and that step always scares me because you don't realize how high it is. On another note, bed is very comfy and toiletries are nice.","May 16, 2019","5    Santorini Princess

The hotel is set out for pampering, the spa treatments were great and reasonably priced (they even do pregnancy massages!), the breakfast was out of this world (omelette station, fresh pancakes, different types of cake daily, you name it!) and also the restaurant was really good with an unbeatable view (especially recommend the Iberican pork).

They are genuine in their friendliness and concern for your happiness with not only Princess - as the local taxis call it - but your stay on Santorini.There is no doubt why this resort is so highly ranked on Booking.com and TripAdvisor - it earns it from the dedication of it's staff which was evident from the top down.International standards of the highest level were on display mixed with a local flavor and investment from the owners. There seemed to be too many staff on at all times. The restaurant staff, the hosts, the cleaners and the drivers were all beautiful people.

300,"Santorini has always been on my bucket list. We chose Santorini Princess for our honeymoon and was not disappointed.The first thing that impressed us were the views and sunsets . They are spectacular at Imerovigli and I personally believe they are better than Oia . We loved Imerovigli because it was a quite so you can relax in peace. There is a lovely walking track that takes you to their local village which has lots of supermarkets ,restaurants and a pharmacyThe other thing that impressed us was the staff especially Georgia,Sophia and Dora who are genuine and gorgeous , they made our holiday at SP very special.We had room 21 which was the honeymoon suite with SPA . It was lovely and romantic! The only downside to our stay was when when I got out of the SPA I slipped on the slate. The SP staff took me to the hospital and helped translate . The radio therapist at the hospital said falls are quite common in Santorini due to the smooth slate tiles. While the staff were amazing I believe this could of been prevented if the hotel had put up warning signs eg : “slippery when wet” Unfortunately my injury effected the rest of our honeymoon !","April 26, 2019","5    Santorini Princess

301,"We stayed here a few years ago and were really looking forward to returning. The hotel is situated right on the rim of the caldara, with those spectacular views! A walking track in front runs along the edge of the caldara, linking Fira (about 4km/50-60mins south of the hotel), through nearby Imerovigli (about 20-25mins), and continues to Oia (about 6km/1hr& 45mins north of the hotel). If you don't feel like hiking there and back a (rather unpredictable) bus service stops on the entrance road behind the hotel and can help out one way. We appreciated being situated a little distance from the tourist hoards that invade Fira regularly during the day from the many large cruise ships in the harbour. Our room was beautiful - large and very comfortable, with a small private balcony, table and umbrella. This was a perfect spot to enjoy a glass of wine while watching the sunset. As other reviewers have mentioned, the staff are amazing. They all made us feel at home from the start, remembered our names and responding promptly and courteously to every request. A very minor negative was that we were not able to get much information about traveling independently by bus to a couple of the less frequented tourist spots, such as Pyrgos and the nearby wineries. It seemed to be assumed that most hotel guests would simply use the more expensive private hotel transfer vehicle for local touring. Breakfast was wonderful and we particularly appreciated the lady who made coffee any way we liked! We had dinner several times at the hotel, as we couldn't be bothered traveling too far afield, and this was also excellent. However the quality and variety did seem a little better on our previous stay and it would have been nice if the menu could have changed a bit from day to day for repeat diners. The pool area was very relaxing with adequate sun lounges and the water was pleasantly warm (heated from early October). I also enjoyed a complementary massage, which was unexpected and much appreciated. All in all a really enjoyable stay once more.","December 5, 2018","5    Santorini Princess

302,"I don't think I can add much to the already plentiful and superlative comments here. They're all TRUE! We've traveled a fair bit and have never encountered such sincere and comprehensive assistance from pretty much every one of the staff. I mean, really, FIVE stars? And over 1,000 reviews? It goes without saying that the tireless and enthusiastic Georgia is truly a treasure. From the moment we arrived until we left she remembered us and, on a daily basis or more, greeted us with a cheerful smile and relevant comments. Well, the staff at the restaurant mirrored her enthusiasm...Yannis, Dimitri, Nadia...everyone was so warm and genuine. How do you train that into people?The breakfasts were wonderful, with some items consistently there every day as well as special pastries and other dishes. The omelets and other eggs made to order were fresh and delicious. Any kind of coffee you like was there for the asking. We had dinner there once and room service another time - all very good.Prior to our visit, I had read about Room 24 with the stairs and was a little anxious about it if we happened to be assigned to it. As a previous guest had also stated, we're seniors and we were worried about maneuvering the stairs from the bedroom in the middle of the night. Yes, we were offered a choice between 24 and another room. Looking at both, my husband commented on #24 - it's so charming. And it was. There's a very sturdy handrail and leaving the bathroom light on with the door closed provided plenty of light since there's a ""porthole"" in the door. I don't know how the balcony compares with others but it was well enough above the path to be pretty private, had a lovely view and was so comfortable.We were there in October and, with the windows and doors open, there was no need for air conditioning. Except on a Saturday night when there was a wedding somewhere nearby and it got a little noisy. So, close the windows, turn on the AC, no problem.The lovely walk to Imerovigli was about 15-20 minutes on a path that was either cobble stone or concrete. Going the other direction to Oia, the path soon turns to dirt and eventually narrows. When we traveled to Oia, we saw that the path leads onto the road at the outskirts to Oia. It's a narrow shoulder with busy trucks, buses and scooters. We decided to opt out of that walk.The hotel provides ""transfers"" that are very convenient and will take you wherever you want for little more than a taxi and much easier. We did take the bus a couple of times. The stop is just up from the hotel on the main road between Oia and Fira plus other destinations. Apparently the stops are less frequent after summer and the sign with the schedules did not reflect that. We waited a little over an hour for the bus to Fira and saw 2 buses going the other way, to Oia, during that time. They're called ""Local Bus"" and are large but frequently crowded. Coming back we could only find one from Fira to Imerovigli which we took and then walked back easily.Besides the beauty of the setting, another notable thing is the quiet. Most nights we had our bedroom windows open so that we had a wonderful breeze plus...no noise. Just wonderful. And looking out to the lights of Oia or Imerovigli and sometimes a ship....priceless.I can't imagine staying anywhere else.","November 4, 2018","5    Santorini Princess

303,"This beautiful property is tremendously enhanced by the service staff. I cannot say enough about all the people who worked so hard to accommodate us. When we left we felt like we were saying good bye to wonderful friends. I especially want to give thanks to Georgia in the front office who made it seem like we were the only people she had to attend to. Also, the view from the dining room was amazing. The wait staff were so accommodating to our large party for my nephews wedding especially Nadia, Akis, Dimtri, Vannis, Sofia and Sofia Jr. This property has some spectacular views of the Caldera.

304,"Warning. If you stay at this hotel you may be ruined for life. The staff is so friendly and helpful. The restaurant is very good and there is no extra charges for room service. The daily free breakfasts are wonderful with a crepe and omelet chef along with many other delightful tasty treats. Here is just one example of how wonderful the staff is. We went for a sailing/snorkeling trip, arranged by the staff. As with most activities on the island the company will pick you up and drop you off in a van with other people on the excursion. On the way back it started raining quite hard, as people were dropped off they ran for cover. When we reached our hotel there was a staff member waiting for the van with two umbrella's for use to use for the short walk to our room.

305,"Just back from a fabulous few days away to celebrate my 50th Birthday. From the moment we arrived we were made to feel so special with an amazing welcome from Georgia and the team. It’s the little personal touches and the genuine friendliness of everyone working here that mean so much and make this hotel stand out from everywhere we have ever stayed before. The views from the hotel are amazing and I loved being that bit further out from the hustle and bustle. The coastal walks are breathtaking and if you don’t want to walk the buses are frequent or the hotel has its own driver who will shuttle you for a small fee. We found this invaluable when trying out a recommended restaurant nearer to Oia. I don’t think I can add anything more to the previous reviews that can tell you how fabulous this place is, just book it and go see for yourself!! Would we come back? Yes in a heartbeat!","October 24, 2018","5    Santorini Princess

306,"Couldn't fault the Santorini Princess at all. The position of the hotel gives you the most amazing views across the Caldera and provides awesome sunsets. It is away from the hustle and bustle of the main towns, but they are in walking distance (if you like stunning coastal walks - be sure to take a pair of trainers/hiking boots) or just a quick drive away. The staff were very attentive, making sure we had everything we needed and going out of their way to give us tips and advice on the island/restaurants/excursions.Heated pool was definitely a bonus in October!

309,"Wow. I really dont know where to start. What an incredible experience at this boutique hotel. I read through many of the reviews posted here and thought, goodness...they summed up my/ our thoughts exactly! What makes this hotel so special is it’s staff. They are all 5 star people. I could list the names of every single person but I would risk forgetting some. They are SO dedicated! They work EVERY SINGLE DAY. They have a smile on their face, they are cheery, they are attentive....not sure how they do it from March-November. I felt like I was with family-literally hugged each one that I saw before we left and had tears in my eyes. It is a beautiful, immaculate hotel. Food was great, rooms beautiful (we had the honeymoon suite. Yes, after 30 years we are still honeymooners!) the view—insanely gorgeous. The only downside is that it is not close to Fira or Oia. They provided transportation (and nothing in Santorini is cheap!) but we found it the best thing to do as those drivers are nutty! The manager of the property was on site and we had an opportunity to tell him about our experience. My hope is that every member returns when we come back! I’m a bit worried that all of these glowing reports will cause them to be booked when we plan our next visit  To the staff- we love and adore you all!!! Thank you for the trip of a life time!

316,"We visited this hotel mid September 2018, we were 4 adults and 2 rooms. Upon arrival we were met with such friendly staff that provided us with a tour of the facilities. Our check in was at 3pm and we arrived in the morning, so they accommodated us in a room where they brought our luggage which allowed us to get our bathing suits and spend the day by the pool until our rooms were ready. Our rooms were nice, but I wouldn’t call them luxurious. They were well equipped and very spacious and clean. The bed was comfy which is always very important when travelling. The breakfast buffet was included in our room price which made it very convenient in starting our day. The food was good and there was a good variety. Again I must stress that the staff was outstanding and really made our stay so much more amazing. They welcomed us back to the hotel every time we arrived after a day away and were always willing to help and offer assistance. The view is spectacular and the area was the best place to stay. Thira was super busy and crowded and offered no solace or quiet escape, Oia, although beautiful and so picturesque in every lane way again it was always busy, noisy and crowded. Imerovigli was perfect away from all the commotion and a great location to have a glass of wine and watch the sunset in peace. I would highly recommend this hotel mainly for its location, spectacular views, outstanding staff and service. ","September 23, 2018","5    Santorini Princess

For our honeymoon it was amazing I have never received service like this. The hotel has a nice pool with Jacuzzi and the rooms are very romantic and spacious. We would recommend a trip to Ammoudi Bay which is near/in Oia. Certainley go to Oia to watch the sunset (we did find the hotel was as good as the views in Oia and our balcony was probably the best place for it (try to get room 20 it has an amazing view) Ammoundi Bay goes down a but hill to a little romatic cover of restaurants which is picture postcardesque. Overall if your looking for a romatic - peaceful break with sun - this is for you. P.S I looked at lots of hotels in Oia and Fira before I booked this as a surprise for my partner - upon viewing these hotels (some more expensive) whilst we were there, I was so happy to have picked this one!thanks to georgina and all the staff who made our honeymoon so special !

Interesting ""window"" panels on the door that opened inwards to help with the heat, although there was aircon too.The hotel has 2 outdoor pools, and parking is available in a lot just down the hill.

335,We were surprised by the quality of the accommodation at Antonia for the price- what a great find in Santorini! We rented two small apartments and both had some views of the sea. The kind owner arranged a pick-up at the ferry and the driver was waiting for us on time. The a/c worked great and the two cute pools were perfect for a quick dip at the end of the day. The location is truly charming - in a quiet residential area just 1 block off the main square and 2 blocks to the caldera. We would definitely stay at Antonia again. Loved it!,"September 21, 2017","6    Antonia Apartments

338,"This was a lovely short stay in Fira - the third hotel in this city of our trip. Antonia was by far the best value of the three. The rooms are basic but they are both comfortable and clean. The location is also nice - you're close to the old town and caldera but far enough away that it's quiet at night.There are two little pools on property for a short dip, and some of the rooms have balconies.

342,"We stayed here for a couple of nights in September, and it was one of the most memorable experiences. It's very close to the main attractions in Fira, as well as the bus stop which takes you to all other places on the island. Also many bike rentals available nearby, or via the hotel too. The rooms were basic but comfortable and clean. And the free shuttles from the port or the airport are much appreciated. Although the best part would be the treatment received from the owners and staff. They go out of their way to make you feel comfortable and help you plan your days on the island. We were offered coffee / wine on arrival, and our host (hate myself for forgetting his name) proactively explained every necessary detail to help us plan our two days. This was done individually for all guests on arrival. Maybe other places in Santorini do this, but I've never experienced this in any other hotel in the world. It might not be a caldera facing 5 star resort, but at the price, we'd definitely recommend this place. ","October 5, 2016","6    Antonia Apartments

343,"We stayed here for 3 nights in a standard room. Our booking was with Apartments Antonio, but it would appear that the hotel is also named as Hotel Antonio. We were picked up from the airport and dropped off at the Ferry Port. We were welcomed and given an overview of what we could do on the Island, plus a carafe of white wine, which was replenished each day. The owners and staff were always very helpful and friendly during our stay. The people at the reception desk were always and friendly. The room was a quite large, having an area similar to that for a normal double bed room, plus an area of the same size with a lounge suite against the wall. The room was well maintained, and had individually controlled air-conditioning, a refrigerator, an electric kettle and a hair dryer. It was a very pleasant room. Wi fi was strong. The bathroom was a good size. The water pressure was good with hot water when required. The hotel was very quiet and was clean and well maintained. We were on the ground floor and had a small table and two chairs outside. We also used the small swimming pool which was clean and refreshing in the warm weather. Breakfast was not provided, but we were invited to go to the local bakery and bring food back to eat at tables in the bar area. Tea and coffee was freely provided. The hotel was well located in the middle of Fira, close to the bus station and all the local sights and shops.

344,"We stayed at this hotel in July 2016 as a couple for about 86 Euros a night. We booked it knowing that it's not a 4 star hotel but the location is fantastic and the reviews were great.The hotel provided roundtrip airport transportation and it doesn't matter what time you arrive or depart, they are willing to pick you up/drop you off. We arrived early and left early so we were super happy that they did that.We arrived at the hotel with a warm welcome. The owner sat us down and gave us a brief introduction of santorini, telling us where to go and what to see. He also helped us rented an ATV and was able to take care of all the extensions for us. The rooms are obviously not 4 or 5 star hotel rooms but they do the job. We really only needed a hotel room to sleep at night so it was good. They kept the rooms EXTREMELY clean. Once I came back to the room during the day and saw house keepign scrubbing the kitchen. We didn't even use the kitchen. So I was pretty impressed they were so thorough.The only problem is the Wifi, like another reviewer said. We stayed in 2 different rooms during our stay, 1 room's wifi was very spotty, and the second room straight up didn't connect to wifi unless we are standing by our room's door. Given there's not much on TV, we couldn't even use wifi to watch Netflix - wish the owner would fix this issue as in this day and age, people need the internet.The location of the hotel is nice. You are literally steps away from all the shops in Fira and 10 minutes hike to Fira to see the amazing scenery. Although we are away from the crowds, the rooms are not too sound proof and sometimes you can hear kids screaming outside. But overall it wasn't too big of a deal and didn't affect my vacation one bit.","July 28, 2016","6    Antonia Apartments

The hotel representative took us to the hotel in a mini bus from the ferry station. The hotel is on top of the hill. It took us 40 mins to reach the hotel. Our suite was very comfortable with big kitchen and bathroom. This hotel is very close to local bus stand. The hotel provided free Wi-Fi, free tea/coffee and paid guided tours. They have a small swimming pool, but we didn't find time to use it. We took the local bus for our excursion as it was cheaper. The bus timetable is available at the hotel. We enjoyed eating the falafel from a nearby falafel shop. All kinds of provisions, food and other items are available near the hotel. We were Indian eggtarian women visiting this hotel, we had no trouble finding food as per our preferences.I would definitely recommend this hotel to all.Santorini is a must visit place as it offers panoramic views and pristine beaches.

Also - at the top of the road is a shop called 'self-service' and its run by the nicest guy in the world - we went in every day to buy water and wine and he will open bottles for you to try for free as well as give you samples of cheese, etc. Altogether 10/10 - loved it!

The grounds are open, very nice, and well kept. There is not an elevator, but our hosts always offered to help with our luggage if needed. Our room included a little kitchenette which we were surprised by. It included all the basics to cook a simple meal in the room if needed. It even had a little patio area, but it was too cold for us to enjoy. The room itself was of decent size; comfortable enough to spread out a bit.

362,"Since it wasn't the greatest time of the year to visit Santorini, we were stuck in our hotel a lot more than expected. I think Anontia would be great in the summertime when you're out and about on the island and would just really use it as a resting place, but in the winter it is not suitable. A few things that rubbed us the wrong way: The hotel claims to have Wifi but it did not work at all in our room, it only worked in Reception which closes at 8PM. It was really frustrating that during the day the teenage daughter was only there running the hotel and while (bless her heart) she tried her best, they kept claiming that it was a problem with our devices and not their Wifi. Usually this wouldn't be so important to me, but I needed to connect with my husband back home. They offered to move us rooms but we quickly realized that every other customer at Antonia was having the same problem. Next, the rooms were freezing. We had a heater in the room but it didn't seem to do the trick and we were quite cold. The rooms are also very minimal so if you are stuck inside due to bad weather there is really nothing to do (very few channels, no DVD, no Wifi) and everything on the island was closed. What really got us was one evening, my friend and I were sitting in Reception, and another customer came to tell the hotel manager that he and his wife needed extra blankets to which the manager responded ""We don't have the housekeeping isn't here"", and then the man told him that they accidentally broke glass and needed it cleaned, to which he responded ""You'll have to wait until the morning the housekeeping is gone."" The customer told him if he just gave him a broom he would clean it himself and the manager said again ""I don't know where a broom is the housekeeping is gone."" I'm sorry, but if you are running a hotel you SHOULD know where everything is and how to help your guests. Having broken glass is a safety hazard. The overall feeling for the hotel was not positive and we ended up changing our flights to leave earlier than we were suppose to. The owner seemed annoyed with us complaining about the Wifi and we became uncomfortable staying there. Having travelled all over the world, this is probably the worst place I have stayed. I have received better service from a Thai guest house for 20 Euros a night than this place. But like I said before, I'm sure it's fine in the summer when they have more guests and up their services during tourist season. Just don't come in the winter, ever.","February 28, 2015","6    Antonia Apartments

366,"This was such a beautiful place to stay, very spacious, comfortable with all amenities, endless supply of free coffee, tea and wine and walking distance to all amenities.The block is a couple of minutes walk to the bus terminus from where you can catch a bus to various attractions like the Red and Black beach, Sunset at Oia etc.Its also just a few minutes walk from shopping, great restaurants and the cable car/ferry terminus to go to the volcano.The hotel provides free airport pick and drop.The owners are very friendly and helpful and we would highly recommend staying here.","August 13, 2014","6    Antonia Apartments

367,"In Santorini, it is difficult to find good value for your money and a great location. And you also have to decide whether you want to stay in the middle of the island (Fira) the north end (Oia) or the very rural but scenic south end (Akrotiri). You can find good value at a nice, simple hotel like the Antonia. The staff at Antonia was very friendly. On our arrival, we were offered coffee and a carafe of wine. The owner was very helpful and asked several questions about our visit to help with our plans. He even arranged for a car rental which is the best way to see most of the island and for dinner plans in Oia. The rooms are a decent size with an A/C and mini-fridge. The bathroom was large although the curtain made it difficult to use the shower. The Wi-Fi worked although it did go out sometimes. The center of Fira is a 4 minute walk and the free airport/ferry shuttle is a nice benefit. There is no breakfast or restaurant but there are several spots very close by especially the Corner House, We enjoyed our stay at Antonia and would visit again. We also would look for a more luxurious hotel next time if we can find one close to the same price. Or you can pay twice as much for the views in Oia.","June 25, 2014","6    Antonia Apartments

368,We had a nice small room with a balcony and sea view and free WiFi. There was no breakfast included but that was not a problem for us. If you have a rental car the hotel is a little difficult to reach. It is at the bottom of a really steep hill on a partially unpaved one lane road. We had an under-powered Fiat and it was actually really questionable that we would be able to get back up the hill. Also the only parking area is several blocks away at the top of the hill and there is no guarantee that there will be an empty space. The traffic in Fira is terrible and there are hundreds of people walking in the streets but we were able to drive to interesting places all over Santorini.,"July 9, 2019","7    Galatia Villas

The roof jaccuzzi was lovely, one tip I would give the staff would be to inform customers of it's location when they arrive as it can be missedas it's not part of the same building, it's down the road.

The room we had is cozy, came with a(n empty) mini fridge, a hair dryer, and iron. There's also a small private pool, which we didn't use because we didn't have the time. It could use some (more?) maintenance, I think.Before we left, the staff suggested we stay a bit while they checked out the room.

373,"I booked a studio and discovered that it was a standard room when I went in when I asked them about it the reception said he is new and does not know how and why it happen except that he will give me a refund. A refund and apology should have been given immediately on check in. Room was small and stuffy. Shower curtains felt like it was about to drop off and shower head cannot sit on the holder. Towels were off white. My sister got the studio which was spacious but if you are big you will not be able to fit into the bathroom you may need to bath in the pool. It’s a cheap hotel so I guess you get what you pay, poor maintainence and tiny tiny bathrooms even though room size is about 300 sq ft due to bad design. Service is friendly and helpful generally.","November 13, 2018","7    Galatia Villas

374,"Located only 10 mts from the beautiful city centre, we enjoyed our stay here. The disclaimer is that the rooms are of varying types and dimensions; so I cannot speak for other rooms. We stayed in a small studio apartment with a small lounge, kitchenette and a small balcony with beautiful view in addition to the bed room. The kitchenette had induction cooker, fridge, microwave oven and kettle. One of the three nights was quite warm and we had to switch on the aircon, which was a bit noisy. There is a really small swimming pool, which my son really enjoyed. The reception staff were helpful. They had arranged airport pick up and drop off for us.

381,"We recently stayed here for 2 weeks with our 11 year old son. We stayed in room 10 which was perfect as it was in direct view of the pool. We found most people stayed here for 1-2 nights, so pretty much had the pool to ourselves for most of the holiday which was great because it is small with only 4 beds. We found the room to be great, there was a small kitchenette with bowls, plates, glasses, mugs a toaster, coffee maker, kettle and a toaster maker. Anything else we needed (a bread knife) was just asked for from reception and was given right away. The cleaner is such a lovely hardworking lady, she keeps everything spotless and the bedding and towels were changed everyday. The room had air con, it did the trick for when we stayed, no issues with it being noisy. The bathroom was small, and the shower was small but it did what it needed to do, hot showers at all times of the day which is a bonus! There was a roof terrace with a small tub with more beds on the other part of the villas. There is a steep incline to get to the main road but there are steps to the side, or, you can walk under the bridge which rings you to the road and is less steep. Take a torch for if you walk back from town at night, the steetlighting isn’t the best and the road surface is quite uneven in places. There are 2 little supermarkets within a 10 minute walk, one is very close and sells fresh pastries, pies and bread. Very good prices and friendly staff. Anna’s supermarket was further away, but opened later and was also brilliantly stocked. The reception has a small fridge selling water, beer and soft drinks at a reasonable price, and the staff are brilliant and very friendly. I have a bad back and found the bed not to be comfortable, but my husband who has no issues found it to be fine. Our son had a sofa bed which was fine for him. Nice touch of shampoo, shower gel and soap left in the bathroom. The pool was small and quite nippy, think you would struggle to get more than 2 people in, but most people dont come to Santorini for a pool holiday I suppose. The location was good, in a nice quiet place away from the town, but not too far, very manageable to walk to and from town, it’s about 10-15 minuets away depending on your walking speed. The WiFi was brilliant, We had coverage everywhere we went in the villas. We would certainly return to this hotel if we were to go back to Santorini, it was very good value for money, clean and the staff were very friendly!

382,"A great family ran hotel on the outskirts of town. The rooms are basic but thoroughly cleaned and have bedding and towel changes every day. The kitchenette has a kettle, toaster or sandwich maker and a good sized fridge and the showers are hot all the time with great pressure at all times of day. The pool area is quite small as the photos suggest, with a few good quality sun loungers to use. We stopped here with our 11 year old son for 2 weeks, which seems to go against the norm as most guests were travellers, and we were completely happy with the hotel. The lad loved the pool but if you are after a poolside holiday then please look at the pictures provided by the hotel for some overviews. There is also a sun terrace with a small jakuzi style pool, and more loungers. The staff were very helpful to us and arranged our transfers from and to the airport with ease, and the maid is fantastic working hard 7 days a week to keep the place clean and tidy. On the whole I would say it was great value for money and is in a good location to town, being only 10 mins walk away. There is a bit of hill to the main road which is 20m long with steps to one side, you can also walk under the road to access the street which is less steep. If you are just an average Joe normal bodied person it isn't even worth mentioning. The wifi is great and free, and has good range and there is a mini bar in reception for cold beverages. Overall a great little hotel.","May 26, 2018","7    Galatia Villas

384,"Just got back having stayed here for 4 nights for my first wedding anniversary, and i must say what you pay for, is what you get..Hotel is situated in a decent location, roughly a 10 minute walk from the main Fira town strip. Not too close or far. It is however located down a steep hill and can be a bit of a climb on your way out. Even if you are going down, be careful. However i hired a scooter so this wasn’t an issue during my stay. Scooter was parked for free just by the main entrance of the hotel. Upon arrival we were welcomed by a friendly receptionist, who took us up to our room which was room 6. Room was clean to a decent standard and was cleaned daily. The sheets were also changed daily. The bathroom however had a horrible smell which I couldn’t get rid of. There was no fan or window that could open in there and I dreaded going in there whenever i had to. Maybe a window that actually opens would help? Also you could hear water running through the pipes in the middle of the night which was very annoying. The wifi was really good on the other hand. Checkout was at midday and we weren’t being picked up until 9pm later that evening. We asked for late checkout prior to arrival but this was declined unfortunately. However staff were nice enough for us to leave our bags in the reception until 7pm when the reception shuts. We waited a further 2 hours before our pickup at the top of the hill (near main road) as our transfer bus wasn’t able to go down close to the entrance when we were dropped off due to how steep the hill was. After we could no longer leave our bags in reception after 7pm we simply walked to the main strip to kill 2 hours with dinner before heading back and waiting for our transfer by the steep hill. All in all a decent stay, Probably wont stay here again if i go back. Santorini however is a beautiful island! ","April 16, 2018","7    Galatia Villas

385,"* Firstly, apologies for lateness in posting review! *For our arrival, we pre-booked with the hotel a 'private' pick-up transfer (€10 per person) from Athinios Port. I'd read lots of stories about the long slow trip from the Port to Fira. The trip is approximately 10km, but the first 4km is a very steep climb up a narrow single lane road, with 7 or more tight hairpin bends. There is no opportunity to pass, so after a ferry has arrived, the traffic is like a long slow procession of ants crawling up the sheer cliff-face. To get a jump on the traffic, we made sure we were among the first passengers off the ferry. We found our driver holding a sign with our name, and thought we would be on our way. No - that's when we discovered our 'private' transfer wasn't private at all. We waited for 5 more passengers off the same ferry, and then 2 more passengers off the next ferry. After 45 minutes (or more) we were finally on our way. By now the traffic was horrendous! Each passenger paid €10 per person - so €90 for the mini-van to travel a 10km trip - an absolute rip-off and misrepresentation of the service we were sold! In addition to this, we were not dropped at the door of the hotel. Instead we were dropped off roadside at the top of a steep hill and left to navigate the decline with our luggage. The hotel was nearby (down the hill and around the corner), but no staff member came to meet us and assist with our luggage. Not exactly a warm welcome!At check-out we experienced more transfer problems - this time going to the Airport (€10 per person - distance 5.5km). We had a 6:40 am flight (to Athens), so had to be at the Airport at 5:40 am. When we pre-booked the transfer with the Hotel, we were told we'd be picked up out the front of the Hotel at 5:00 am. By the time we got our luggage to the front gate it was 5:03 am. We waited 5 minutes or so and nobody arrived. The Hotel reception opens at 8:00 am so there were no staff available. We wondered if there had been a mix-up with instructions, so decided to head to the roadside (where we had been dropped off when we arrived). I waited roadside with the luggage, while my husband went back to the Hotel to see if he could locate a member of staff. The streets were deserted and I was beginning to think we were stranded and had no way of getting to the Airport. After some 10 minutes my husband came back - he was unable to find any Hotel staff. Finally I saw a minivan driving towards us. I flagged it down and amazingly it was our pre-booked transfer - running 30 minutes late! We caught our flight in time, but it was a very stressful experience - particularly at that time of morning where there are no alternative options available.As for the Hotel itself, we enjoyed our stay (4 nights). The room was comfortable (apart from getting access to the bathroom - you had to side-step past the bed, and even then it was a tight squeeze!) and very clean. My goodness, the housekeeping lady works tirelessly! Single-handedly she cleans all 10 rooms daily, as well as ironing (as I noticed on the surveillance monitor in reception). She literally runs from room to room, carrying heavy bags of dirty laundry, and buckets with cleaning products, mops and brooms. By the end of the day the poor woman must be exhausted - particularly in the summer heat! The pool is very small, but inviting - it's both enjoyable and refreshing to take a quick plunge at the end of a long hot day of exploring the island. The pool closes quite early, and whilst this seem a little odd, I guess given guest rooms are immediately beside the pool, it's to ensure guests have maximum quite and privacy. The garden area (surrounding the pool) has a nice ambiance. Our room had a kitchenette, although cooking hot food is not permitted. A few pieces of crockery and some utensils are provided - suffice for preparing breakfasts (cereal, toast and tea & coffee - but no bacon & eggs; hard-boiled, scrambled, poached or fried), and cold meats and salads for lunch or dinner. The was a small fridge with freezer - perfect for cold drinks (you can't drink Santorini's tap water!) and keeping supplies from the supermarket fresh. The Hotel's location is great - just 500 metres or so to the vibrant heart of Fira. Everywhere you go in Santorini, its steps, steps and more steps. Whilst the hotels that cascade down the caldera's edge appear very romantic, and they offer magnificent views - can you imagine having to carry your luggage in and out! Considering this, the hill you have to navigate to reach the Hotel is a breeze, in comparison! The Hotel recommended us some inexpensive restaurants (Taverna style) serving hearty Greek food. Getting around the island by local bus in easy (regular services to the most popular destinations) and cheap. Think twice about hiring a scooter - no rental company will offer you comprehensive insurance. Yes, you get third party insurance, so if you crash into somebody else that cost will be covered, however crash the bike with nobody else involved and you're paying the repair costs yourself! A good way to destroy a fun holiday, unless you're carefree and don't care about such things! Yes, we enjoyed our stay, despite the problems with both transfers. Considering the price of other Hotels in Santorini, this was definitely value for money.","November 5, 2017","7    Galatia Villas

388,"My friend and I stayed for 4 nights, very happily. The pictures on booking.com made the pool look MUCH bigger than it is, but we really weren't fussed by it and didn't even use the pool much in the end. The location is great, 10 minute walk into town and then an even shorter one back from town because it's all down hill! There is a steep hill just as you exit/enter the street for the villa. Be careful, there are stairs to the side that are less slippery. The studio room was lovely, with an incredible bed and lots of space. Everything was very clean. I found it strange that even though a coffee maker was on the bench of the kitchenette, there was no coffee provided. The staff were lovely, helping us with our large suitcases up and down the flight of stairs to our room, even putting the bags in our room whilst we checked in. They often sat outside reception drinking coffee and always said hello as we passed. We had a very pleasant stay, but were woken a few mornings by a rooster. Frustrating at the time, but funny to look back on. We were quite happy here and would definitely recommend it ","September 4, 2017","7    Galatia Villas

389,"We paid for a transfer from the port to the hotel offered to us by staff. The transfer left us at the top of a steep incline to walk approximately 500 metres to the hotel. Since we are travelling for 3 months and have heavy suitcases this was less than ideal, my friend fell over wheeling her suitcase down the hill. It would have been nice if the transfer had dropped us out front or alternately for someone to meet and help us with luggage, and also to help us take it back up the stairs of the hotel when departing!Upon arrival we were met by a young man who was friendly and showed us to our room. We asked him a few questions about the town and where to go for dinner and he said he didn't know and didn't really want to book a table for us when we chose somewhere to go. On departure we asked another staff member to book a taxi for us and he made it seem like it was big inconvenience to do so. Additionally, we were not informed the tap water is not drinkable in Santorini which resulted in a funny tummy after a few glasses of water until we were informed elsewhere. We only stayed for one night (pre-arranged) and were glad it worked out this way. Despite the service, the rooms were adequate and clean.

392,"My mum and I have just spent a week at Galatia Villas and we had an amazing time. This is a very small hotel (15 rooms) and it is very similar to a boutique hotel. The grounds are lovely with beautiful colorful flowers and plants.We had a studio which consisited of a double bed and a sofa/ bed and a little kitchenette that had a kettle/ toaster/ fridge. You couldn't cook hot meals but it was just big enough to make a cold breakfast/ lunch and obviously to store cold beers/ wine!The room was kept spotless and I have to praise Mimosa, the cleaner, for being so hard working especially in the 44 degree heat! She doesn't speak a lot of english but she was always polite and try and have a chat with us. The owners of the hotel couldn't do enough for you. The wi-fi worked brilliantly and was free of charge. The hotel arranged for the airport transfers which cost 10 euros/ pp. There is a small pool and 4 sunbeds and we found that they were always free because a lot of the tourists were out and about visiting the island during the day. There is also a hot tub and some more sunbeds upstairs next to a couple of the rooms. The location of the hotel is brilliant as it is a 10 minute walk to the centre of Fira where there are plenty of bars/ restaurants and clubs. The bus station is also within 10/15 minutes walk which is easy to use to be able to explore the rest of the island. There is a small shop that is a 2 minute walk from the hotel which was very convenient to stock up on things and it was open till very late. We throughly enjoyed our stay in Fira and Galatia Villas.

394,"Stayed in the studio for 3 persons. The hotel helped arrange an airport shuttle for us for 10eur per person. The driver had to wait for all passengers which was a bit of a downer because there were flights that was delayed. When we reached the hotel, there was someone to greet us even though is was already past midnight.The room was decently sized but the shower was tiny. There was air con which is defitnitely good. The hotel is 15 mins walk to town which is okay and not too bad.Overall, this was a great value for money no-frills kind of hotel. I would recommend it to anyone else travelling on a budget!","May 30, 2017","7    Galatia Villas

396,"Although Galatia is close to the center of town, it is mostly uphill getting there. Make sure to bring a small flashlight if you are planning to walk back to the hotel at night. Our apartment unit was in a different building from the hotel. For the excellent pricing, we had a comfortable one bedroom apartment. We would probably not stay here again because of the uphill walk into town. Instead, we might splurge for a caldera view hotel in another town on Santorini.","December 7, 2016","7    Galatia Villas

Old towels.If you have an opportunity try not to stay in Fira, as the city is dirty, chaotic and nothing to do. The hotel doesn't offer breakfast saying that there are a lot of places outside, but the food in Fira is mostly bad or average, so it is difficult to find really good food for breakfast.","October 2, 2016","7    Galatia Villas

399,"I have just spent one week at Galatia Villas with my daughter. The owner and his two sons take great pride in their hotel and so they should. It was impeccably clean (the sheets and towels are changed every day)and not even a speck of dust under the bed!! The bedroom was standard size for a three star hotel, the bathroom a little small but everything worked well, especially the shower. The owner and his sons were very helpful, the hotel is very conveniently situated (quiet). There is a walk up the hill to the town but I am in my late sixties and it was absolutely no problem to me - and it is downhill all the way back!

400,"We were lucky enough to find out we had been given a free upgrade on arrival. The room was massive, we were very comfortable in our stay. Clean room, Comfortable beds, great water pressure in the shower, spacious room and a kitchenette to prepare small stuff if wanted. The reception staff were more than helpful in assisting us with everything - bags, maps, things to do, port transfers, bike hire. The only thing we found difficult was the location, as one of our family members had bad knees and there was a large hill to get down to get to the room, and then several steps up. Pool was shaded and a lovely afternoon swim. Would definitely recommend staying here. Thank you.","September 18, 2016","7    Galatia Villas

401,"I have been in Santorini many times and stayed in several places. This time we only stayed one night on our way to another island. Galatias is fairly well located on the outskirts of Fira and it's a good alternative if you absolutely want to stay in the capital and you are on a budget. The room was small and very warm, but the house in itself is quite cosy. The beds were rock hard and the shower small. It's a steep walk up to the centre of Fira, but, on the other hand, you'll get home in no time. Galatias is good value for money and the personnel very helpful.

402,"We stayed here in August for 4 nights. Our travel agent had chosen this place for us, and we did check reviews on trip advisor also which were mixed but mostly good. Next time I'd personally stay in Oia. Upon our arrival, we were very happy. Young man at front desk was very friendly and helpful. Our room was the smallest I'd ever seen but to be honest I wasn't too concerned about this as we don't really stay in the room much when on holidays but it was small! The bed was rock hard- very uncomfortable. Pillows also very uncomfortable. Our toilet didn't flush well, and our sink leaked for a day all over our bathroom floor. We told the man at the front who came and fixed it, very helpful! There was a TV in the room with one English Chanel, air con worked well. Galatia Is about 25 ish minutes away by car from Oia and about a 5 minute drive away from the main town in Thira. We hired an ATV and got around the entire island with this. Highly recommended. We parked it right outside our room. Average stay overall. ","September 4, 2016","7    Galatia Villas

404,"Based on the nice reviews and photos my friend and I saw on trip advisor we made a booking. On arrival, after managing to navigate the slippery and dangerous downhill slope with heavy cases in the heat we were very happy to find that our hotel looked just as good as the photos we had seen, so made up for the very early ferry ride, the horrendous hill and being over heated from exerting ourselves on said hill with heavy cases. We were greeted on arrival by what appeared to be very friendly helpful staff. We were a little early for our 1pm checkin, so we were told to go for a walk and lunch and to come back after 2.15pm, which being in holiday mode we were both ok with that. On our return we were escorted half way back up horrendous hill to a very boxy unattractive building that was our accommodation! We were told that we were right next to the jacuzzi, then our 'friendly hotelier' raced away quickly. We were still in shock at where we had ended up with, so we didn't unpack and decided to check out the jacuzzi. Then finding that it was not much bigger than a spa bath and overcrowded and literally no room for us, we high tailed back up to reception where we were told that unfortunately they could not do anything that afternoon but would move us the next morning at 10am. The next morning it was a different story with another staff member refusing to move us, telling us the hotel is exactly as the photos and that trip advisor had been there recently and taken more photos, he was getting rather aggressive and it was most unpleasant. After long 'heated discussion' we were moved to a studio next to the pool. It was very nice and more in line with what we were originally lead to believe we were getting. None of the photos we had seen on the Internet showed photos of the building where we had to stay on the first night, and with only 2 precious nights and 2 years in the planning it is very very disappointing. If we had of known what kind of room we were going to be allocated we would never have booked this hotel. It looks lovely in the photos ....but beware also have a look on wotif at the reviews as well and you will see reviews like mine...not getting what you were lead to believe you had booked based on the website.","August 13, 2016","7    Galatia Villas

The location was down a steep hill, and it was difficult to get up and down with luggage from the shuttle (but once you are on the main road, the walk to town isn't terribly offensive).

408,"We arrived about one in the morning and although in theory the reception was closed the owner was there to welcome us and direct us to the car park (since we had informed them of our late arrival). This was a nice touch and he provided us with a map of the island and a calendar as a gift when we left. Staff were friendly.The outside of the villas is beautifully whitewashed and fresh. We had room 10 near the tiny pool. It was clean but rather dated. It was supposed to be a studio and I had booked it so we had a kitchen. However, there was no means to cook anything as there was no hob, microwave or cooker. This was a disappointment, as was the bathroom - it was so small you could not even turn around in it. Also, the shower had no wall attachment so you had to hold it all the time - not ideal. The TV had limited channels and did not include the BBC - normally this would not concern me but with the wifi really slow it meant keeping up with the UK post referendum news was rather a challenge. The hotel location was ok, no view and its about 10-15mins uphill walk into Fira town. It's best to walk rather than take the car as you have to drive up a very steep single track road (praying nothing is coming the other way) to join the main road and then around a long one way system to get to the town centre, then it is almost impossible to park. Galatia Villas was OK but I wouldn't stay there again.","July 11, 2016","7    Galatia Villas

409,"Lovely quiet complex. Staff very helpful and rooms very clean, sheets changed every day. 10 minute walk to Fira town centre, which was ideal for us. Although a lot of traffic, but keep to the sides. Our room was very nice. Bathroom was a tad small for 3 people and more storage space for 3 people would have been nice. If you get the mini bus, be prepared to walk down a steep hill. It was ok for us as we welcomed the exercise but can be quite hard going in the hot climate. Again if you don't mind the walking in to Fira, this is a lovely complex. Air conditioning superb and you have a fridge, kettle and toaster for your use and complimentary water on arrival. Fira itself has loads to offer as the main town. Best beach to visit is in Perissa which you can get the bus to at 2.40 euros each way. Bus station can be a bit manic, but hey your on holiday. I could go on but know others have covered the main things. Lovely island. If you love wine do, do the wine tasting at Pelican Kipos Cafe Wine Restuarant. Maria is your host and is lovely and passionate about the wines and the island. The food here is also amazing, you may wait a while but note, everything is made from scratch. I could go on but other visitors to the island will share their experience and you need to discover some for yourselves.

Light airy room (3) with single beds and small bathroom with shower, fridge, kettle and tv (no English channels). Although small - we never really crossed path with other guests which was nice. The pool is lovely and gets enough sun and shade to sit by all day on quieter days. The roof top jacuzzi is away from the hotel overlooking the neighbouring hotel but also lovely and has gorgeous views to the beach side of the island. Air con and safe in room were free!!Lovely approachable staff!The villas are just the right distance from Fira centre - an easy 10 min walk into the lively town - yes the road is busy but the hotel is set away from it - only the donkeys come by in a morning and evening!","June 25, 2016","7    Galatia Villas

411,"If you are looking for an affordable holiday to Santorini then this place is perfect for you. Although the villas are a 10 min walk away from main Fira this is not an issue at all. It is very easy to navigate. The room was lovely, not very big but was modern and extremely clean. We were however self catered and there was only a kettle and fridge provided which was fine for us as we love dining out on holiday but I don't think the villas provide any type of restaurant. If you want a place with a decent pool then look elsewhere as both pools/sun-lounging areas have around 3-4 loungers and 2 very small pools with not much sun (1 is a hot tub) but to be honest Santorini would be wasted on you if you were to just sit by the pool all day!!

We also used the rooftop area which had sunloungers and a ""hot"" tub (it wasn't hot!)The only negative if I had to say one would be the location as it is at the bottom of a steep hill and to get to the centre of Fira, you either have to walk along the main road with no footpaths or through the back streets, which aren't great at night! But then if the hotel wasn't in this location then it wouldn't be at the amazing value for money that it is.I definitely recommend this hotel if you are looking to stay somewhere that won't put you out of pocket but is still close enough to everything!","May 16, 2016","7    Galatia Villas

For starters, the airport transfer is cheap and convenient, right on time there and back, which is big considering taxis are super expensive in Santorini. Once we got to the hotel, we were greeted by Elias who was extremely nice and helpful. The whole hotel is family-run and they really show pride in their work. Our bags were taken care of and we were shown around the property after being served a complimentary homemade drink which was delicious.The hotel itself is very nice and quaint. We asked for a crib and was taken care of no problem. Room was clean, showers are nice and the hotel is very quiet. Kitchen area is small, but functional. The pool is great but not heated, which I don't think is a problem later in the season, but was a bit chilly at times at the beginning of June. Breakfast was great and very convenient also. The location of the hotel is very central, close to walk to Fira and the bus station, but not so crazy busy if you were actually staying in Oia or Fira. But the best part of the entire hotel is the balcony with an amazing view of the Caldera.

425,"I have been to Santorini 3 times, each time I have picked hotels with killer views(that I didn’t really use) and killer price tags. This time my knees could not cope which is why I picked this place. The entrance is on the road below which is just 2 flights of stairs, the back entrance is on the walking track, perfect. It is a family run business by a lovely family, the daughter runs the front desk and she will go out of her way to assist. The nephew, Ilias went out of his way to assist, as we were traveling with mother who just had a knee replacement, he could not find a taxi to take us 1 km, they were asking for big bux, he found a way. It has a great pool, very clean and you are in the heart of Firostefani. ","July 7, 2019","8    Reverie Santorini Hotel

426,"My 5 night stay at the Hotel Reverie was amazing! Nikolina and family/staff were friendly, wonderful and very helpful with planning my stay and organizing some tours. Rooms were very clean, breakfasts were great. Everyone was very accomodating and eager to help. Reverie is a perfect place to stay,excellent location and very close to Fira and yet a quiet retreat!

427,"We have just returned from an 8 night stay at the family run Reverie Hotel and we would rate it highly. The family were friendly, informative and really helpful. They will answer every query you can think of! Room was spacious and cleaned every day. Beach towels are free to use. Any request we had was fulfilled! Pool is small but very refreshing! We used the roof terrace was every eve, fantastic views and great for a beer and a chat whilst waiting for the sunset. Nice restaurants along the front (various price ranges) and Two Brothers bar was our favourite by far! We booked the Boat trip through the Hotel which was good value and fun! (although be prepared for walk to top of volcano!) The main bus station is a 20 min walk, just before the large supermarket. Bus station on left / Supermarket on the right. There is also a great small shop as you come out the front of the Hotel (First one as you walk to the right) really friendly!! The buses are pretty easy to navigate. We went to Kamari and Perissi beach. Kamari was our favourite and it is nearer (Try the King's restaurant at the end of the promanard. Great food and service) the sunbeds are free when you have a drink or food. We walked to Oia (Be prepared for a hike!) 2.5 hrs long, but worth it (get the bus back) Fira is only 10 mins walk. Which has lots of lanes with lovely shops. You can also get the cable car down to the port or walk down the many steps! The Hotel is in a great position for everything we needed and was good value for money. Can't recommend the Hotel or the staff enough. Santorini overall is beautiful, but be prepared for some high costs in some restaurants/ bars!","June 25, 2019","8    Reverie Santorini Hotel

430,"When searching for a hotel in Santorini it was a bit difficult to choose since there are no ""name brands"" and I wasn't sure which part of the island to choose. However, I'm so pleased I ended up at the Reverie based both on TripAdvisor reviews and one in a guide book. First of all the location is excellent - while it is on a foot path that leads to Fira in 10 minutes and Oia in 3 hours (a long but fun hike!), it is a little out of the crowded centre so was a bit quieter. However, we were still steps away from great restaurants (in fact we made one reservation by shouting from our balcony). Based on other reviews we chose the suite which meant we had a balcony that overlooked the sunset as well as a second level window which gave us an even better view. I also can't say enough about the service - from the minute we were picked up at the airport until the minute we were dropped off, the owners were attentive and friendly. Nikolina checked us in, Elias gave us the tour and helped us find activities. I believe it was the dad who picked us up at the airport and a sister who prepared an excellent breakfast. I would recommend paying the extra for the breakfast - it was home made and deliciousand I doubt you could do much better for the same price elsewhere. Only two small comments on the suite - one is that the bed is on the second level while the bathroom is on the first. It was a bit inconvenient if you needed the bathroom in the night, but not terrible. Also the ceiling on the second floor is quite low - we're not tall but still found ourselves banging our heads occasionally. It would be problematic for really tall people.That aside, I highly recommend this hotel.","June 11, 2019","8    Reverie Santorini Hotel

432,"I cannot commend this hotel enough - outstanding hospitality, spotless rooms, wonderful facilities, and a wonderful location. I'd choose to stay here vs in Fira or Oia towns - it's quiet and everything is conveniently near i.e. minimart, reasonably priced restaurants, bus stop, and Fira town is a good 10-15 min walk away.

433,"The Reverie was truly a pleasure to stay at! Upon check in the host Elias gave us a rundown and map of where we were and some tips on the area including excursions and where to eat. He wasn’t pushy and explained the different options for where to eat and what the area offers. He gave us a tour of the property including the rooftop terrace (which is a must for watching the beautiful sunsets!). We were very happy with the excellent, attentive customer service. The area is much better and more quiet than the capital of Thira/Fira. I wouldn’t recommend staying in Fira or Oia as the streets are packed with tourists from the cruise ships and the prices are a lot higher. This hotel has access to both the main road and the walking street facing the caldera with restaurants and shops etc. We were picked up for our tours directly from the hotel which other hotels aren’t able to offer as they don’t have access to the main road. The hotel also arranged a rental Atv for us which was very helpful as we read some bad reviews about some places being unreliable or scamming you. We were able to park directly outside the hotel which was great! The rooms were spacious and clean with kitchenettes that included basic utensils etc. Beds were comfortable and each room has a free safe. Pool area was small but welcoming. ***Long story short: amazing, quiet location, with exceptional service and excellent accommodations. ","May 21, 2019","8    Reverie Santorini Hotel

441,What a lovely experience you gave us two Australian couples who stayed for four nights late September 2018. Thanks to you all for your amazing local Greek hospitality - just what we were after and you all delivered in spades. We will definitely be recommending your place to others - the best we have come across in the Greek Islands. Also especially want to thank George for the fun transfer to the ferry when leaving - what an experience which we can laugh about now. Local ferries had been cancelled for the two days prior due to a Medicane near Athens - a three-hour traffic jam winding down to the ferry - a trip that usually takes 15 minutes ! Made it by the skin of our teeth - great memories. So highly recommend this place - two minutes walk to the lovely picturesque Caldera view,"November 3, 2018","8    Reverie Santorini Hotel

Location is excellent for walking into Fira and easy parking opposite front entrance if you hire a car. When you’ve spent a few days in Santorini, you’ll realise that it’s a very expensive place compared to most other mediterranean countries/islands.

444,"We were attending a wedding on Santorini and one of the recommended hotels by the bride and groom was the Reverie. It was my first choice and now I have no doubt I made the BEST CHOICE. The location is outstanding. And, while it is not directly hanging off the cliff, the hotel has a rooftop patio for guests to have a fantastic cliffside view, and, by the way, the other side of the island, too! It is a great place to enjoy an early morning cup of coffee, a late afternoon beer or a sunset glass of wine! The accommodations are an excellent value for the money with updated rooms and baths. The hotel has a small bar and the breakfast is the best value on the island and a great way to start your day. Having said all this what really makes the Reverie special is the staff. In all my travels, and I have traveled a good bit, I have never experienced a more professional or kind staff. They go out of their way, to the person, to make you feel welcome, to orient you to the island, to help you plan activities, to assist in anyway possible to make your stay comfortable, relaxing and memorable. I think they actually become friends! From the time a very friendly gentlemen picked us up at the airport until the time he took us back to the airport, the Reverie was a home away from home...and, in some ways better! What an incredibly beautiful island and what an excellent choice of a base from which to enjoy it. If you're staying in Fira, then, you will have chosen wisely if the Reverie is where you plan to stay.","October 15, 2018","8    Reverie Santorini Hotel

He was exceptionally helpful and informative with booking excursions, general information about the island, and helping to clean up a broken glass that went all over our room.

446,"We were welcomed to the hotel with a drink and an excellent explanation of where we were, how to get to town (not far to walk), the local restaurants (expensive and bargain) the best place to take photos and finally we were led past the pool to the rooftop seating area where you can sip a drink, watch the sunset and catch up with fellow travellers. The breakfast was big and filling with 3 choices from 3 segments eg toast/cereal/eggs from the menu. Our room was well set up with a balcony fronting on to the road and a comfy bed. The balcony was perfect to catch the sunrise and a great place to eat breakfast. Traffic noise is not a problem because of the double glazed doors. We cooked some nights on the hotplate because we had meat and salad but we also tried the local recommended restaurants and they were all good. The hotel backs on to the lane that takes you along the crater ridge line past restaurants, mini marts and tourist outlets. We also booked a tour through the front desk and if you hire a car there is parking across the road. The only drawback was that the pool looked so inviting but the water was a bit chilly - just like the Mediterranean so probably not an issue for others.","September 25, 2018","8    Reverie Santorini Hotel

457,"We stayed at Reverie in Firostefani for five days as a surprise birthday for the mrs and she (we) did enjoy the surprise and the location of this beautiful family run hotel who are brilliant at what they do for their guests. Our flight arrived very early in the morning but our request for airport pick up was accommodated and were picked up by George, the dad who was very welcoming and upon arrival at the hotel he gave us a welcoming drink of their homemade liquor made by the mom mrs Vana (who also makes fabulous chocolate treats which you can have at breakfast). When we were shown to our room there was a bottle of wine and birthday greetings from the family and staff for the mrs ❤️ ( a lovely touch, THANK YOU) The studio room was big and lovely and beautifully done up with the pool just across. The bed was very comfortable and also has a day bed/sofa in the room. The room had a hot plate cooker, kettle, pots/pans, crockery and most importantly for us a fridge to keep beverages chilled to enjoy later watching the sunset from their rooftop sitting area (the views are fantastic of the sunset and the caldera!!! ) Bathroom done to a high standard with toiletries provided. Room cleaned daily to high standard. Front entrance to the hotel is on the main road and the back entrance to the property leads right onto the Fira/Oia walkway with so many restaurants and cafes and a mini mart and the most spectacular caldera view that every visitor to Santorini would love to see to one side and the other side leading to Oia which is around two and a half hours walk but is also such a fabulous place with restaurants, bars and shops of all sorts. Nikolina and Kelly were so helpful with information and tips about the best places to visit and helping us book a sunset catamaran cruise, a whole day bus tour covering nearly everything to see along with wine tasting and a wonderfully relaxing and refreshing massage. Breakfast was another fabulous service which is very reasonably priced and cooked to perfection. I wanted to surprise my mrs with a beautiful location, fabulous accommodation and excellent service where you feel so at home, and what I got was exactly that and more. The satisfaction and happiness I saw in her was proof that Reverie as a family had provided everything and more that they could to make our stay as memorable as it was. Based on our experience with the satisfaction of overall service we would highly recommend Reverie to anyone who wants quality accommodation, quality service, excellent location and all at a great price. Thank you Reverie family and staff for the most memorable of all our holidays. Thank you, God bless.","June 22, 2018","8    Reverie Santorini Hotel

459,"Glad we decided to stay with Reverie. From the moment we were picked up at the airport to the time we left everything was smooth and easy. The room was spotless, comfortable and had everything we could want or need. Location was fantastic and worked as a great central base for exploring. Staff was very helpful, they helped us arrange the hire car to be delivered and also gave plenty tips on where to eat.

461,"We stayed 4 nights at this clean, centrally located hotel and enjoyed our time there. We booked late so we didn't have many good options. Thankfully, there was one room, I believe, available. And we took it.You can walk most everywhere from the hotel but that is also a negative. There is no intimacy. No place to sit and quietly take in the sites. The obstructed view at the top is noisy because of restaurants and activities below as well as the loud road that fronts the hotel. (the dbl glazed windows, however, do a wonderful job muting the loud road noise inside the room - sleeping was not a problem.)I wouldn't stay here again, though, and that's not the hotel's fault. Service and cleanliness met or exceeded our expectations. It's just that we want that view more than we thought and the privacy. The Manos Small World Hotel, a short walk south along the back path, looked very nice and was only marginally more expensive, It, however, was sold out, when we tried to book a few months back.Reverie is a fine hotel. If you're going to stay here, be prepared for its shortcomings and accept them, and you'll have no regrets.","May 23, 2018","8    Reverie Santorini Hotel

462,"I booked the Reverie based on reviews I read, location, photos on their website, and price point. The wonderful hotel did not disappoint! Excellent location both due to the Caldera Being right outside the back entrance and Fira (the bustling capital) being a ten minute walk. Very clean room and comfy bed. I had a single and though room and bathroom were small, there was not a thing I needed. It was perfect for one! I was greeted by Elias who gave me a wonderful rundown on local things to see and also poured me a shot of house made liquor. A warm welcome indeed and a nice way to begin my trip.I checked in with Nicolina every morning who helped me plan my day. She made what I wanted to see realistic sonthat I would not feel like I was running around too much. I followed her advice and each of my sightseeing days were wonderful. The Reverie has excellent booking for day trips such a a winery tour and sunset sail. I actually cancelled a catamaran tour I booked before I checked in and instead scheduled Nicolina’s suggested one. Half the price and absolutely wonderful. Excellent meal, lots of room on the boat, and a solo saxophonist who played right at sunset. The winery tour was also excellent.Great personalized service and lovely accommodations at a very reasonable price. Sunset views each night within a three minute walk.","May 20, 2018","8    Reverie Santorini Hotel

The lovely family who run it are extremely friendly and helpful - each and every site, mode of transportation and restaurant that they recommended turned out to be excellent. The room is spacious and spotless, and the roof terrace overlooking the Caldera is breathtaking. The breakfast is very good and a bargain at 8 Euro. We told the owners that we are celebrating our 30th anniversary and when we arrived, a bottle of wine and a note of congratulations were waiting for us as a gift!

There are lots of restaurants nearby to choose from, so you’ll never be short of options.Our room was spacious, well equipped, clean and comfortable. The pool – just what was needed after a busy day exploring the beautiful island. And the view from the rooftop was fantastic.But the real stars of the Reverie are the people (particularly Nikolina, Elias, Kelly and Mr George). They were brilliant! Extending the warmest of welcomes, as if we were old friends. They couldn’t have been more helpful, providing great information about what to see, restaurants, buses, car rental and more. We can’t say thank you enough to them for helping to make our holiday so memorable.We would highly recommend staying at the Reverie, and would definitely stay again if (when!) we return to Santorini.","May 17, 2018","8    Reverie Santorini Hotel

465,"There are three main areas of Santorini. Fira, the busiest place, Oia, the prettiest hill town, and Firastefani, which is so close to Fira it's almost an extension of it. Firastefani is the best place to stay because it is close to all, yet quieter than Fira.The Reverie is right on the caldera walk, but not on the ocean side. However, our room was very large and had its own large patio, and a clear view of the ocean on the other side of Santorini. Our room was on the road side, but with the door to the patio closed, it was very quiet.The front desk staff are extremely helpful. They arranged for a rental car from a trustworthy company, who met us at the hotel and brought the car to us, parked directly across the street.You could stay on Santorini and spend hundreds of dollars a night, and if it's your honeymoon then do so.

The hotel itself is absolutely lovely, and so is the family who runs it!! It was a perfect location and infact alot of my guests even thanked me for booking here instead of one of the hotels down the cliff, as The Reverie is very convenient for parking (right across the road from it) and right on the walkways going through Santorini, with Steps literally less then a minute away taking you down the cliffside if you should you desire. We also got the shuttle service they offered which was perfect and so stress free! I cannot thank Nikolina enough for all her help with everything, and when we return to Santorini we will definitely be going back to the Reverie, Truly a perfect hotel with greek charm that I would not hesitate to recommend to anyone.","January 9, 2018","8    Reverie Santorini Hotel

Close to a number of great restaurants. Public bus stop is maybe 200-300 meters away. - Staff were friendly and quite helpful.- Were able to provide a crib for our infant.- Room was a good size. - Rooftop Balcony was a great stop to watch the sunset or people watch in the evenings.

476,"This hotel is perfect if you are in santorini as a couple. The staff is top notch from check in to check out ensuring that you have a great time and all your needs are met. We even switched rooms halfway through our stay for an upgrade, and when we got back to our hotel everything was moved into our new room without us having to deal with any of it. The pool area is beautiful and comfortable. One of the best spots away from the crowds to watch a sunset. We made some great friends there as well! The location is quiet and the little village Megalochori is a short walk away, perfect for a nice romantic dinner that is much more reasonably priced then Oia or Fira. The drinks and food at the hotel are also delicious if you are looking to stay in.If you de use to stay here and would like to check out the rest of the island I highly would recommend renting an atv. You can park at the the hotel and easily get anywhere on island without having to deal with the ridiculously priced cabs or less than reliable buses.

479,"If you're travelling to Santorini and want to get away from the crowds, do yourself a favour and stay at the Grand View. The hotel sits on the edge of the caldera and has the same awesome sunset view you'll find at Oia - without the crowds, and you can see it very night without travelling. The view also comes with cocktails if you wish. The staff are incredibly friendly, and we cannot tell hotel management how lucky they are to have the wonderful Nickki as their ambassador. Nickki made our group of 6 very welcome and was a credit to the hotel in terms of service and friendliness. Cudos also to Chef who went out of his way to make me a wonderful soup to counteract my seasickness - I can't thank you enough! The rooms are spacious, well maintained and very clean. If I had one suggestion, it would be that the beds could be a tad softer. Also, Megalochori is a wonderful little township and well worth the walk up the road to have a look and perhaps dinner. That said, the food at the Grand View is very good and well worth trying. Getting to Fira or Oia from the hotel is also incredibly easy via the local bus - the bus stop is a short walk up the road.

The view is amazing and the 4 days we stayed at hotel, we never stopped pinching ourselves how lucky we were. If you want to stay away from hussle and bustle of the main towns Fira and Oia then this hotel is for you. The hotel is private, out of the way and not on top of other hotels with no privacy. Which my husband and I enjoyed. To get around though, you do need transport unless you want to catch bus and risk walking around the roads. Food and drinks are reasonably priced for a hotel. There are some quaint restaurants within walking distance in the old town. Rooms are clean, good size and very quaint. We had a pool room with pool and ocean views. Room was amazing. Breakfast was standard. Staff are very helpful and welcoming. We didn't have kettle in room for making tea ( which I like to have when I wake up) and next day cups and kettle put in our rooms.

The standard double was awesome.. everything new and the bathrooms  elegantly styled.  However- next time I will book the superior double to get a private balcony.The buffet breakfast was full of Greek delicacies and homemade jams, cake, delicious yogurt and honey from Olympia.. plus  local products. The pool has new sunbeds- comfortable and big- stay there to enjoy the sunset!! Having drinks &  cocktails..!. The food from the new kitchen is very tasty and  cheaper than the nearby restaurants. I enjoyed pasta, salads and  original Greek souvlaki... The shrimp pasta is a must. I got very good advice from the reception about how to go around. I rented a car and drove all over the island. I also enjoyed the catamaran volcano sail and got a better price from the hotel for this- this sail is also a must (a bit expensive ..but worth it) The hotel has a large parking place. .and almost no steps.. which is not easy to  find  in Santorini.

489,"All the good things you’ve read about this place are true: the position, the view, the poolside food, the people, the service. Also the location in Megalochori is perfect if you don’t want to stay in the hotspots around Fira. You really are a few minutes’ walk from the centre of this lovely village, with three inexpensive tavernas. The buses are cheap and fairly reliable. You are also around an hour’s walk from Pyrgos, Emporio and Akrotiri. That said, in the autumn at least the scenery is a bit drab away from the caldera edge. Beware: the position 600 feet up the caldera does leave the hotel fairly exposed to the winds. In the summer that is probably a bonus; in October it is fine when the sun shines but it can be chilly in the shade. We splashed out on a jacuzzi suite. For October, when the main pool is only for the hardy, the warm jacuzzi water is a great advantage. We had Room 2, which is on the top level and must have the best view (see the terrace image on the hotel’s TripAdvisor page). It has a generous barrel vaulted ceiling and lots of space. It also overlooks the jacuzzi in the room below, which is probably not such a good bet. That said, you pay a lot for a jacuzzi suite but this is still definitely a three star hotel. The room is large but fairly empty, with a smallish wardrobe and no drawers. The polished concrete shower room is basic and cramped. The comments in other reviews about “tired” decor are probably right (take a look at the Athermi Suites next door to see what can be done). The jets in our jacuzzi worked only intermittently (but we didn’t bother to report them during our stay; I told Andreas about them when we left and I have no doubt that he will have sorted it straight away). One other thing: watch out for the online reservation system. It will take a couple of days to confirm your booking - this left us rather in limbo with our flights. And the charge to my credit card was a lot more than the sterling price on the website. It seems this was because the system charged me in euros not pounds. The hotel was very understanding (as with everything else) and reimbursed me the difference. All told: a great hotel, and it gets five stars from me because of all the positives. But if you pay for a top room then you are paying a five star price for what is still a three star hotel. ","October 21, 2018","9    Grand View Hotel

490,"The good stuff:Great views, superior location away from the craziness of Fira, just outside the charming village of Megalochori with is charming little shops, restaurants,wineries and the wonderful Santorini Horse Riding stable in the town.The breakfasts were absolutely the best we had in Greece, thanks to the lovely lady who does the cooking, clean up and keeps all the patters well stocked and attractive. The maids were discrete and accommodating.The buses to Fira, Akrotiri and the rest of theisland were handy, inexpensive and frequent.The stuff you should know:The winds are strong at times due to the cliff-top location and windows ad doors slam all the time and very loudly. The pool is lovely but unheated and hence in October unusable. The sheets are so starched they are like plastic and spoiler alert, you don't flush the toilet paper (actually any paper) but put it in a sealed can. Delicate sewage systems exist on several of the Greek islands.The things to avoid:Apparently rooms 13 and 14 are the ""loss leaders"" with the lowest rates. Do not stay in room 13, which is next to the very active laundry room and in the pathway to the pool and the pool bar, i.e., lots of noise. Room 14 was probably the better of the two. We got moved to another room with persistence (and without paying the requested ""up charge"")and they were fine.Please note, we are really not very hard to please and overall the hotel was very enjoyable, especially the sunsets and the breakfasts.","October 14, 2018","9    Grand View Hotel

The location is great - away from the worst of the crowds but still easy to get anywhere on the island. The pool area is a great place to relax and unwind (and enjoy a drink). The food at the restaurant was tasty. And the staff were amazing. Andreas is a wonderful host - friendly, helpful and incredibly thoughtful. It was my partner's birthday while we were there and not only did he help us choose a fabulous restaurant, he surprised us by not only ordering a birthday cake, but picking it up from the bakery and delivering it to the restaurant himself.

493,What a great place to stay we only 3 nights here but loved our room with the balcony with views of the Caldera...nice and modern great style very relaxing. I picked this location away from Fira and Oia as I wanted something quieter and this is it with great views. They have a chef who does the BEST souvlaki...the chicken skewers with the pita bread and dips that go with it are yummmmo...my favourite. The village of Megalochori is a 5 minute walk from hotel it has a roof top bar and restaurant and small shops around. Location wise to Fira and Oia is about 20 mins...bus or hire a car. Staff here are all fantastic and I thank them for making it a memorable stay on the Island of Santorini...highly recommend. ,"October 1, 2018","9    Grand View Hotel

494,If you are looking for quiet and away from the noisy night life this is your place. It has also scenic view that facing some of its island. No need to go to Oia to have a sunset photo. The place is clean and I enjoy sitting on the porch where I had my beer and the awe inspiring view of the pool and the ocean as well as islands. Most especially the sunset..We also enjoy the excellent breakfast they serve. But there is the cons on it for those people who loves to walk leisurely and take local bus like me this is not a place for you. But if you have a rental vehicle it will be perfect. The bus stop is half a kilometer away bringing your luggage with you is a discomfort not only the distance but also the chances that you will be hit by a running vehicle while walking along the 2 way narrow main road and that is without a walkway going to the hotel is very hazardous and unsafe especially at night. I had to take my chances because I love to explore the local community where I want to try also the local taverna and to visit the nearby mini mart which is a kilometer away from the hotel. We need to change our plan of using local bus going back to the airport and ended up hiring there car services instead.,"September 23, 2018","9    Grand View Hotel

495,"Grand View is quite simply one of the most amazing hotels I have ever stayed in! Two couples stayed in the Private Pool Villa which I couldn't recommend more! You have all the perks of a hotel, plus the privacy & luxury of your own space. The food is AMAZING and the chef Vaggelis will step to any challenge...even a simple dish like salad he transforms into something so delicious! Vassiliki is a great bartender & waitress and all her service is given with a smile, she is such a friendly lady! Thanks to Alex, our stay was a smooth process. He arranged all our transfers, spoke to us in detail about the island and no query was too much for him. Overall, the staff, view and high standard of the accommodation make Grand View a really special place to stay. My only negative was that the breakfast is very basic, a bit more choice and more of a cooked option would be great!

499,"Having been home for a few weeks now, we can look back at an amazing trip to Santorini and especially our stay at Grand View Hotel.We had the pleasure of staying there for 10 days and enjoying their great hospitality and service. Even before we arrived to the hotel, the staff was very informative and helped us making reservations at various restaurants across the Island. Upon arrivel we had a transfer to the hotel, securing a smooth 10 minute drive from the airport. Arriving 11.30 pm we didn't have to check in immediately, but had our luggage brought our room and after a good night sleep and an good local breakfast, served ind the hotel restaurant, we checked in. We had the pleasure of staying in room no. 15 - a superior double room with balcony. The room was situated on the ground level of the hotel just next to pool and with and breath taking view over the caldera ocean with an amazing sunset every night. Even though the room/balcony was next to the pool, we never felt that our privacy was invated in any way. The hotel is fairly small (16 rooms) and intimate and very well kept. The pool area holds place to 16 sunbeds and a few dining tables. We had plenty of relaxing time by the pool and was only interrupted a few times by a some noisy kids having a blast in the pool :) The staff is amazing and outmost friendly, helping us with all of our enquiries, questions and requests. No request was never too big! Due to the small number of staff, you get to know the quite easily and that makes it very homely to stay there. In terms of food and drinks, the hotel has a good breakfast restaurant with everyhing you need. The buffet is kept clean and organized and was never overcrowded in its opening time from 8.30-10.30. Snacks, lunch and drinks was served by the pool side by the relatively small kitchen and bar. That being said, all things served was fresh, yummy and delicious by an truely friendly and funny poolboy/bartender/cook and a likely friendly waitress. Housekeeping was an uncomplicated affair and the room was very clean and inviting after every cleaning. I can highly reccomend this hotel. It is not inexpensive, but if you want to give yourself a treat, go to this place and have a great experience. If we're going back to Santorini, we're staying at Grand View Hotel again.

500,"Perfect. We're a family of 4 - (2 adults, 2 kids aged 10 & 14 yrs). Our stay in Santorini would not have been anywhere near as enjoyable had we stayed elsewhere. We travelled in peak season and Santorini was complete madness! This hotel was an oasis of calm and tranquility in the storm of tourist frenzy. It's a small hotel so is never crowded. The pool area is just magnificent and so comfortable. Views from the pool area are to-die-for. Breakfasts were scrumptious and the dinner we had here by the pool, overlooking the amazing view was delicious, generous servings and very reasonably priced considering it has one of the best views on the island - certainly WAY cheaper and more enjoyable than fighting for a spot in Oia. Fagellis (I'm sorry if the name is wrong!!) - the pool bar manager & chef was hilarious, super friendly and really lovely to all guests - he also took the best family photos of us we've ever had! All the staff were brilliant. I was a bit disappointed in Santorini itself - especially Oia which really felt like a fake tourist town - like a Hollywood set of how we perceive a greek island should look. BUT it was worth going - just to stay at this amazing hotel / resort. Don't miss the sunsets from the hotel - why jostle for a space in Oia when you could stay here in the calm of your own resort sipping on a wine / cocktail / beer looking at the same spectacular sunset?! The nearby little villages (walking distance) are also really cute and a more authentic greek island experience. Highly recommend this hotel. Would love to go back again & again & again.","August 10, 2018","9    Grand View Hotel

This was our third visit to Santorini and Grand View Hotel and every time we go back it is special. The island itself is getting busier with tourists, but due to the location and size of the hotel it has not been affected. If you don’t feel like leaving the hotel then the pool bar food and drinks are amazing and reasonably priced. There are several tavernas within walking distance of the hotel if you fancy venturing out and lots of things on offer to do if you speak to the hotel manager who was very helpful.

Makes you feel like a friend, very knowledgable about the island and fantastic his job!!! Bar staff made us a complimentary anniversary drink which was nice, He was very helpful when I fell in the hotel (as I’m clumsy) and cut my leg, and made sure I was ok the following day, then another member of staff asked if I was ok and needed medical attention.

509,"My girlfriend and I were planning a trip to Santorini and I knew I wanted to propose on the trip. I was looking for a place where I could do the proposal at our hotel but it still allow us enough space and plenty of privacy. That is when I came across the Grand View Hotel. From pictures online, I could tell it offered the breathtaking views I was looking for to do a proposal. The hotel offers the best location to take in the sunset. Before my arrival, I had reached out to the Grand View hotel, informing them I was going to be proposing. They were absolutely wonderful to work with and went along with our ""act"" to keep my now fiance from suspecting a proposal was coming. I worked with ""Santorini My Tour"" to help prepare the private villa for the proposal. Grand View was extremely accommodating and worked very well to help them set up the villa while we went to the local winery for a drink to kill time. When we came back everything was set up perfectly for an amazing night. The Grand View team even allowed the company to set off fireworks.After the night of the proposal we had 3 more days of staying at the Grand View. Every morning started with quick breakfast where the cook is one of the nicest and most charismatic individuals you will meet. He also is the one who cooks the food by the pool or for your room service. This was some of the best food we had in Greece. I liked one of the dishes so much I ordered it for lunch and dinner on our final night. In addition, we were looking to do some day activities that the hotel staff (Andreas and Alex) generously set up for us. We ended up renting an ATV for 24 hours and doing a sunset trip on a catamaran, both which I would highly recommend. The ATV allowed us to ride around the island and see all of the different areas. Andreas and Alex took any of the stress of booking those excursion away by calling and setting everything up to exactly when we wanted. The hotel is located in Megalochori part of Santorini. Not having any experience in Santorini, this was a great location for us. It was much less busy and more relaxed than you would get in Oia. This allowed us to truly enjoy ourselves and our privacy. We were able to venture over to Oia on the ATV and it is a great place to check out but extremely busy with buses full of people constantly being shuttled in and out for the day. Our stay at Grand View was truly an amazing time. By the time we were leaving it felt as if Andreas, Alex and the rest of the staff were friends with how nice they were and how much they went above and beyond for us. Anyone I know that will be going to Santorini, I will be recommending them to stay at the Grand View because I enjoyed it so much. They even emailed us to make sure we made it back home safely. I just hope that one day we will be able to come back to the Grand View and see our friends again.","May 20, 2018","9    Grand View Hotel

516,"I'm Santorini dreaming on a snowy day, and finally getting around to writing a review of our stay at the Grand View last July. We stayed in the private Pool Villa for 3 nights. The view from the villa is absolutely stunning. In fact, I loved everything about the villa, the decor, the layout, the infinity pool, etc. I would have been very happy to spend the entire 3 days in that gorgeous spot, just relaxing, dipping in the pool, and enjoying the most magnificent sunset views (without any crowds!). But that would have been a shame, because Thanos is a wonderful host, and full of great suggestions on what to visit and where to eat on the island. It was like having a good friend on the island who was going to make sure wherever we went was memorable. Having spent the first part of our trip fighting the crowds in Oia, I also really enjoyed being on the quieter side of Santorini. Megalochori is a picturesque village where you can wander and even find some solitude in the winding lanes -- and dinner under the stars at one of the tavernas in the village square is a charming experience.Rarely have I felt so welcome at a hotel, and the view is one you will never forget, so I highly recommend a stay at the Grand View.","December 9, 2017","9    Grand View Hotel

We enjoyed the food very much, very simple but delicious. We toured Fira and Oia but glad to come back to our Suite to rest and enjoy the breath taking view.

519,"I stayed 2 nights here in room 15 and could not have been happier! Thanos and his team were super friendly and accommodating. As this was on very tail end of a 4 week trip, I had not planned it very well. I emailed at 7pm about 2 hours before my arrival to ask about an airport shuttle and received a prompt email within about 10 minutes from Evangelos to confirm my pickup. He then greeted me upon arrival at the facilities and gave me a brief tour and led me to my room. I had room 15 which overlooked the volcano and was clean, tasteful, and beautiful. The food there was amazing too! I ordered the chicken skewers one night and finished everything on my plate. Thanos was also very helpful in providing tips on navigating the bus system and finding my way around Megalocholori and let me stay and use the facilities after the 12pm check out since my flight was later in the evening. It's not centrally located to Fira or Oia, but bus stops aren't very far away and the ride to Fira was about 25 min. I would definitely return here and recommend this place to anybody!","October 19, 2017","9    Grand View Hotel

520,"Where do we begin?!? Upon arrival we were greeted by the hotel manager. His energy was infectious. He was so warm and welcoming. He was very informative about the island and its many excursions. We also had the pleasure of dining at the hotel (multiple times). This is because the chef is literally world class. Every dish (and we tried many) felt personalized and was so delicious. I can't say enough about this hotel. My husband would is a photographer raved over the views and the sunset (hence the title). When we visit Santorini again, there's no question where we will stay. The Grand view where the view is GRAND owes us nothing!","October 7, 2017","9    Grand View Hotel

522,"Grand View is the perfect place to stay on Santorini! Everything from the views, to the location, to the rooms, the pool, the staff, the food... truly outstanding. Santorini is a small island and the entire island is easily accessible by car, ATV, scooter, etc. My daughter and I stayed at the Grand View for 4 nights, and during our stay we saw the ENTIRE island by ATV and on foot. After experiencing the other areas of the island, and after enjoying the EXCELLENT customer service we experienced with Thanos and his team, we will only stay at the Grand View when we return. Location: Grand View is near the small town of Megalochori, which is a beautiful, quiet, authentic town near the south end of the island. It is near 2 wineries (winery tours are a MUST DO here -- so interesting to learn how they grow grapes in the volcanic soil.) The hotel sits right on the edge of the Caldera with AMAZING sunset views. (The sunrise is amazing as well.) It is the perfect oasis away from the touristy, crowded towns, but close enough that you can easily and quickly reach any destination on the island.Our room: We stayed in room 15 -- the perfect room for 2 in our opinion. Just off the pool area with a small private patio and uninterrupted views of the sea, volcano and sunset. The hotel: Beautifully maintained rooms and grounds. Pristine. The pool area is outstanding. Because of the small size of the hotel (I would consider this a boutique hotel), even when fully booked, the pool area does not feel crowded. The views are incredible from every location on the property. Thanos and his staff: 1 word -- EXCELLENT. Even before our arrival, we were contacted via email to arrange a shuttle to pick us up at the port (WORTH IT!) I highly recommend you take Thanos up on his offer to discuss activity options on the island during your stay (and listen to what he tells you!) Based on your interests, he recommends places to go, things to do on the island, and how to get there. Truly invaluable information. Plus, he will book anything for you that you need. He had an ATV delivered to the hotel for us, then picked up when we were finished -- TWICE because we didn't need it one day in between (Thanos's suggestion, saving us money). We had booked a sailing tour on our own before our arrival to take place on arrival day (Tip: I HIGHLY recommend Caldera Yachting). The day we arrived it was VERY windy. Thanos called the yacht company and re scheduled for us. Just ask and he will take care of anything you need.The entire staff was friendly and hospitality is outstanding. The food: Wow. The breakfast (included with your stay) far exceeded our expectations. So many options to choose from and all fresh and tasty. Not your typical hotel breakfast by any means. The pool bar café is open every afternoon/evening. We ate there every night of our stay for 2 reasons -- 1: we LOVED the food -- Chef Evangelos is not only a great chef, he is also fun and funny. 2. we had front row sunset views from the pool area for dinner every night without having to fight any crowds. Tip: try the fava!!Overall, we could not have asked for a more perfect stay. We felt pampered and so well taken care of. We can't wait to return!Must do winery: Estate Argyros near Kamari. Beautiful grounds and facility. The tour is so informative -- you actually step in the vineyard to see the vines and baskets, then tour their new state-of-the art facility. Wine is excellent, and cost is reasonable. Not crowded or touristy. Perfect.Sailing: We chose Caldera Yachting for a sunset catamaran cruise. it was FABULOUS. We chose the Gold cruise (max of 16 people, but there were only 10 on our boat and there was PLENTY of room). The crew was outstanding and we had so much fun.Hiking: If you like to hike like we do, we highly recommend the hike from Fira to Oia. Beautiful. We also hiked from Pyrgos to the monastery at the highest point in Santorini. Amazing views.","October 1, 2017","9    Grand View Hotel

523,"The Grandview has Amazing caldera views. This is a perfect location for an relaxing authentic mediterranean experience away from the tourist crowd but only ten minute drive from Fira. Thanos and his team go out of their way to make every guest feel at home. I can't recommend this hotel enough. Room: We stayed in room 7. It had a private balcony overlooking the pool and caldera. The room was beautifully and tranquilly decorated. The room had a bar fridge. Breakfast: Was generous and delicious! A selection of cereals, fruit, Greek specialities (olives/cheese/meat/ yoghurt, pastries and cakes), breads and eggs. The home made jams were delicious! There is plenty of parking.The Grandview is central located within a few minutes of Fira and many attractions. Thanos generously gave of his time by providing us an orientation of the island, maps and restaurant recommendations. Everyone of his recommendations was outstanding and definitely added to our experience. Some general recommendations:Rent a car. I used Romani Rent A CarVisit the Megalochori cave house. Our favourite winery was Santos. Visit in the morning before the tour busses arrive. Make reservations at least three days in advance for restaurants. Favourite restaurants: everything on Thanos's list in particular a little place called Brusca for their Greek platter and Metaxi mas for their amazing views.

Thannos the manager greeted us like old friends, he is such a lovely person as can be said for all the staff. We were delighted to be upgraded to the most beautifully decorated room with an amazing sea view. They have a small pool side bar which does the most lovely food and cocktails, served again from the most friendly staff. The sun set from the hotel is stunning and certainly is a Grand view. The breakfast is delicious and has a wide variety of dishes again served with a smile. We can not recommend this small hotel highly enough.

526,"After amazing recommendations from our friends who stayed here a year prior, we booked this hotel a year in advance (very keen!).When we arrived in June this year, we were told we were the very first booking for the year having booked so early in advance. We were able to stay in the recommended room 12 suite, which has its own spa on the balcony and the perfect view out to the ocean / sunset! The room was VERY spacious, clean and had everything we needed. The hotel food was great, my husband won't stop going on about the 'burgers' we had there. The location of the hotel is great, as it's not in the busy area and has such a cute little town near by for dinner. Which, I'm very happy to say we dined at a restaurant one night and I had the best dinner of our whole honeymoon there!! Which is quite a statement as we had just come from Paris and Naples! I can find out the name again if you are interested just ask :)I think what made our stay was the lovely owner and staff of the hotel. Thanos was a legend, who not only made us feel welcome straight away but sat down and planned out time in Santorini perfectly as we only had a few days. Definitely listen to his advice!! Also, he was able to talk basketball with my husband Josh which I think after 4 weeks with me he was dying to talk to someone else! Honestly, we couldn't thank him enough for a perfect end to our honeymoon!And we will be back very soon :)","September 20, 2017","9    Grand View Hotel

They have the best sunset view with relaxing music. Couldn't be more perfect! I've spent here a wonderful week with my husband. As we also work in hospitality, we know the best what it really means a good customer service and to work months long without any days off. We really appreciate all their help and effort. Many thanks to Thanos, the manager, who is helping to plan your vacation by your taste. Many thanks to Evangelos ,who organized a very late dinner booking on the day we arrived 23:30 .

529,"We stayed here 2nights to celebrate my hubby's birthday and our anniversary. Room type was standard balcony -room no.7. We requested for higher floor and Thanos the hotel manager kindly arranged for us. We really appreciate it and the room is just above the pool and had an awesome view of the sunset. This hotel though located away for Oia and Fira, we actually prefer this area as it's less crowded. In fact we spent both evenings back in our hotel balcony to watch the sunset, away from the crowd. Oia was really busy! We were at Oia on the second day and people started to stream in to secure a good spot for the sunset as early as 5pm( sunset was about 745pm!!!)Room is very modern in fact I think it's newly renovated. Clean sheets which is very important for me. And absolutely comfy bed and duvet. The shampoo and body foam provided is very nice smelling too. Food served at the bar was very delicious (I did not expect it to be so yummy) that we kept ordering. The chicken salad and pesto pasta and the must order octopus was really good !Service wise I have to thank Thanos for giving us a wonderful experience in Santorini. We travelled to Athens and Santorini this trip and Thanos is the only nice person we met. He gave us early check in as the room is already available. And on the last day as we wanted to visit Fira, we requested for late check out and Thanos gave us an extra 2hr which we were grateful for. We asked Thanos to arrange transport for us to Thira port for €20. Everything about the stay was good. I highly recommend this place. ","September 4, 2017","9    Grand View Hotel

547,"We stayed in Roula Villa for 7 nights in June 2017 and enjoyed every minute of it. Nothing was a problem for them. We had a hydromassage pool in our room which overlooked the pool, well worth the extra money. Our room was cleaned every day and we were given fresh towels. The water from the taps is very salty but it wasn't a problem for us. The kitchen was equipped with everything required for making small meals. It is very close to the hike to Ancient Thiera and a 5 minute walk from the beach where there are numerous restaurants and pubs. Most places offered free sun loungers along the beach so long as you bought something in their restaurant and you can stay for the day. We would highly recommend Roula Villa for couples, families or friends. The rest of the island is also very accessible from Perissa. We visited Oia which is the place with the lovely sunset, it is a bit more expensive but worth a visit. We also did the day tour which takes you by bus to the islands, hot springs, volcano and on to Oia for the sunset, we got the tour nearby the hotel for €25 each!","June 16, 2017","10    Roula Villa

549,"This was a beautiful little villa from the outside & courtyard. I don't think it would take much for it to be a boutique hotel but it's not there yet. Our room was on the back side so quiet but kind of dark & dingy. The toilet slowly leaked all over the bathroom floor. It was clean tank water but still gross. The towels were stiff until the last day. I guess they got some new ones. I joked they could go up a star for that. No little soaps, shampoo or anything. Maybe I'm shallow but you need that level of service to get higher reviews. Better linens, & toiletries & this hotel could bring it up a notch. The little kitchenette was good for us to make breakfast & lunch. The walk to the beach is not far but not super close either. The pool was very nice & clear but after the first day we spent most of our time @ the beach. By the way, there are nicer beaches in Greece but you really must see the sunsets in Santorini. Find the 24h bakery. It has good sandwiches and pita. Pack it to go if you visit the red beach. Staff was nice & they booked us a good Shuttle back to the airport. They could probably arrange that to pick you up if you called. The bus system on the island is quite good but it did require one transfer. Would I return? I think I would try another place first but there were no major issues here. ","July 20, 2016","10    Roula Villa

A wonderful clean pool surrounded by the buildings, and in one end a nice poolbar serving all you need and want, all day. Cleaningstaff excellent and smiling. Roula Villa is owned by a sweet family and their son Angelo is the best. No problem too big to fix, everything done for the guests. Katarina so smiling and serviceminded, not to forget the new girl this season, so sweet:)Located near the black beach, bus stop, senter of Perissa and all shops and tavernas you need to have the most splendid holiday.

The rooms are convenient and spacious with a small stove top to prepare practical meals and a kettle. The bathroom however is not exactly what I've wished for in terms of cleanliness. I mean it sure is old with some grime I had to clean it thoroughly before I felt comfortable using it especially that I had my 5 year old with me. It is not that dirty it's just old, but you could manage with. The rooms are right on the pool and it is very kid friendly so is the staff. Perissa black sand beach is just a short walk away.

552,"My partner and I spent 10 nights at this apartment hotel in June 2016. It is in a quiet area of the village away from the main road with free parking but only a few minutes walk to a 24 hour bakery, the shops, restaurants and the beach. The rooms although basic are what we were expecting and kept very clean, with towels being changed daily (although a little hard - good for exfoliating). The air conditioning works well, the water was always hot for the shower both morning and evening. The kitchenette was basic and consisted of a kettle, a two ring hob which worked well, a sink with cupboards underneath and above and a fridge with a small freezer section. The crockery consisted of two plates, four bowls, two cups and four glasses. The cutlery was two of each knives, forks, dessert spoons and tea spoons. There was not a sharp knife, a bread knife or a bottle opener which would have been useful. There was also one small non stick saucepan, a large casserole dish, a colander and a grater.The pool has a small Jacuzzi in the corner and the pool itself and the area around it was kept very clean with a bar serving drinks all day. Angelo and Katerina were very friendly and helpful and gave us some goods tips for places to go whilst touring the island. All in all we had a very enjoyable time at this hotel and hopefully will visit again.","June 14, 2016","10    Roula Villa

560,"Roula Villa Apartments were everything we were expecting after reading recent reviews.Our room was ""typically Greek"" self catering with just about adequate cutlery and crockery etc.You wouldn't want to try and cook a meal, but then we never even contemplate eating anything other than breakfast in our apartment.A toaster would have been nice but hardly a deal breaker! The small pool was lovely, although you might need to get up early to get a lounger.The poolside bar is open all day;normally until midnight and the prices are surpringly reasonable. Although there seemed to be quite a high turnover of guests (there seemed to be a lot of island hoppers) there was never any late night noise-it really was very peaceful. Our room was cleaned daily and all the staff were really friendly. Tip:Before we left the UK we contacted the owners to arrange for a taxi to pick us up from the airport.This worked out cheaper and more convenient than just hailing a cab when we arrived.","July 16, 2015","10    Roula Villa

565,"We were greeted not with even a smile or a welcome. Taken straight to our room and a query about the closest food shop forced a response of 'down the road'. The bathroom revealed a stained shower curtain and a rubber hose and plastic shower head attached to a mixer tap with no way of attaching it to the wall. The stench from the drains didn't help! Day by day a little bit more of the villa fell apart, a slat from one of the beds, a handle and shelf from the bathroom cupboard. The very loud air conditioning unit was effective upstairs in one bedroom but did nothing for the room below and the fridge hummed continuously.We paid for a jacouzzi. Don't bother, complete waste of money . Water heated by daytime sunshine, so not a hot tub as such, I did not see anyone clean it for us during the ten days we were there and would question whether the filters were working, the frames were already broken and fragments left on one of the ledges. Every 30 seconds or so it would switch off and have to be restarted. Any idea of enjoying a relaxing experience with a glass of wine - absolutely not. We didn't feel confident to use it after the first couple of days for reasons of cleanliness.Positives- nicely positioned room, hot water and quiet.We had a fabulous holiday, despite our stay at this villa, the beach was fantastic but please if you are booking a beach holiday here remember there is 7+ kms of sand and a lot of villas to choose from.","September 16, 2014","10    Roula Villa

566,"First of all - Lady Voula is super nice and friendly lady. The family was always around and having nice words or something complementary for our little one. Villa is very clean, the cleaning lady is doing her best and you can feel it! Location is good, 5 min.walking from the beach. There is lot of nice villas and hotels closer to the beach or right on the beach, but this makes from villa Voula quiet place to stay. Rooms are super spacious and nice. If you are searching for studio to cook, be aware, there is not much kitchen equipment. Glasses and cups seems to be every single one from a different opera, so better not count with that kitchen that much. Pool is nice, clean, but you rather not stay there in a hot daily time as it`s incredibly hot. Of course, you are in sunny Greece! You can use umbrellas, but something ""green"", some nature, would make the pool more stayable place during the steaming hot day.If you need wireless, don`t count on it. In the lobby area it`s working good, but not in rooms. You`ll have to find wifi in the bar nearby. I`ll recommend for families, couples searching for quiet place and for everyone who is searching a reasonable price. Voula made our holidays pleasure!","September 6, 2014","10    Roula Villa

568,OK this is a very small hotel and some of the 12 rooms are very small. We had room 5 which is very small as we booked late and no availability however we did get upgraded to a bigger room at no extra cost for last 2 days....was very much better. Greek plumbing is never great so don't expect a power shower far from it...These were our only negatives. We were given free transfers both to and from the port...The property is kept exceptionally clean and Mrs Voula is a lovely host and very welcoming. Santorini is a chill holiday and this place is a perfect base.I wouldn't change a thing Villa Voula is what it is and we loved it....sorry just one other thing worth mentioning the pool is quite small and the shallow end is very limited and still about a metre deep....would be a bit of a problem with small kids....more a romantic couples place. Easy walk to beach...great bakery on doorstep and be sure to try Bob's Bar cheapest cocktails around and good staff. Need to get around the island a quad is great but get one with a decent size engine....We went 80 cc and struggled.

569,"Wow. I am not sure who is writing these reviews, but they might want to see what else Santorini has to offer. My friends and I stayed in this hotel after being evicted from vacation rental in Oia after it was repossessed by bank (seriously). We were in a pinch and booked online after seeing the photos (mostly of pool area) and reading the glowing reviews. We payed 500€ per night, which was non-refundable upon booking, and were sorely disappointed upon arrival. The room, which advertised as a four person villa, was two tiny rooms stacked on top of each other connected by a rickety staircase. The even tinier bathroom had a clogged sink and stunk to high heavens. To top it off, the air conditioner was busted, and the wifi wasn't working unless you were sitting at the pool bar...practically on the bartenders lap. The price on the door listed 120€ for peak season...so make sure you dont pay a penny more. Needless to say, we didnt stay a second night and found other, beautiful accomodations at a resort in Kamari for a fifth of the price. Shop around, folks!","July 29, 2014","10    Roula Villa

Just two of us but we booked an apartment that had 2 rooms and could sleep 4 as the prices were so good. The reviews were good so we were expecting it to be nice, but it's surpassed that. Great location, and great accommodation, with a warm, friendly and lovely owner. Immaculately clean, simple but more than adequate. Pool lovely, spent many a lazy day beside the pool on a lounger. Never a problem getting our fav ones. Saw many guests coming and going but never felt busy, in fact at time was like out own private villa and pool. Voula comes out with little treats and drinks but never overbearing. Breakfast and snacks if you want or use of your own fridge and cooking facilities.

On the second floor we had a private balcony overlooking the ocean, it also came with a private jacuzzi, bonus!! This made all the difference. The room was large and clean. The staff was helpful. The hotel was 200 meters from the beach which was really long and wide. Water was clear and clean. There was many markets and Restos all over Perissa. Good prices and large portions.The hotel had a nice size pool that we used daily. It was cleaned daily and was large enough to cool off after a hot day at the beach. Compared to other places on the island, Perissa is less expensive and quiet,suited for families.","July 16, 2013","10    Roula Villa

583,"My partner and I stayed here for 1 week 17-24th June. We booked after reading the good reviews on TripAdvisor and we were not disappointed. Our transport from the airport was arranged via the hotel. Nikos was our driver who was fabulous, spoke perfect English and was lovely and chatty and very knowledgeable about Santorini. When we arrived at Villa Voula we were greeted by Voula, she is a lovely Greek lady who owns the hotel, very friendly and warm, she lives there during the summer months so is always on hand if you need her. Her English is not great, but it’s enough for you to get by. Voula showed us to our room. We were on the ground floor so had a lovely terrace with table/chairs and a washing line. The room was great, basic, but all that we needed, hairdryer, fridge, shower, towels were provided, TV (didn’t use it), and most importantly air conditioning! Voula will make you breakfast for 5 euro if you let her know the day before, we didn’t use this so I can’t comment. The rooms were cleaned every day, we didn’t have any reason to complain, we were well looked after. Fresh towels daily and the bedding was changed twice while we were staying (1 week).The small pool is lovely, nice peaceful alternative to a day at the beach. We used this one day, the beds around it are comfy, there is also a small pool bar serving cold drinks and snacks. The views of the walk up to ancient Thira are great, and you can clearly see the cute little church ½ way up the rock that is lit up at night. The location of Villa Voula couldn’t be better!!! You are around 2mins walk (if that) from the beach front, which is full of lovely restaurants. There is a mini market around the corner and a 24hr bakery around the other corner!! PERFECT LOCATION! One day we hired a car from a place around the corner called Dimitris, recommend using this as great service and value compared to some of the others around (there are LOTS to choose from). Worth hiring a car, visit Firs and Oia for the day! They are both lovely places, but we preferred the charm and chilled out atmosphere of Perissa!!June is also the PERFECT time to visit Santorini, the weather is boiling, however it is not as busy as July/Aug (every local we chatted to told us how ‘mad’ it is then), and the prices are a lot cheaper during June! We had an absolutely amazing holiday staying at Villa Voula, would recommend a visit and would return ourselves if every back in Santorini!","June 25, 2013","10    Roula Villa

584,"Checked in late, the lady looked tired bit was friendly. The room was excellent and with a fantastic view of Kamari, perfect at Sunrise! The breakfast was fantastic, apologies for all the superlatives, but its deserved. The cleaning team were very friendly as was the barman and breakfast guy. All the staff were friendly and were happy to offer recommendations for food etc. The pools were clean and sparkling, the hotel was continually cleaned throughout the day. There is a little steep hill but its no bother, it has a playroom and a spacious reception with lots to do. WIFI in rooms and reception is good, not that you would want it often in one of the most beautiful and picturesque places I have ever seen. Enjoy the island and don't get caught up in pettiness. My tip, go down the side streets and back streets for food as well as the front! ","July 5, 2019","11    Epavlis Hotel

586,"We arrived at the Epavlis hotel at 2300 on a Saturday evening to be greeted by a very unfriendly lady. There was no greeting or any conversation what so ever. We got our room key and got told breakfast time and where the lift was. We were thirsty so asked if we could buy water, we got a abruptly told the pool bar was open until 11. We quickly put our bags in the room and rushed to the pool bar as we had been told it shut at 2300 and it was now 2305. As we expected the bar was shut. My husband and I went back to the lady at reception, we felt that we were a huge inconvenience. Throughout our holiday the lady and younger guy with long hair were just so rude and just made us feel so uncomfortable. To the point their unfriendly attitude was actually scary. It got to the stage that we would make jokes about whether they would actually say hello or thank you to them as we had to hand in our key to reception. It says that there is a 24 hour reception. As the hotel does not provide an evening restaurant we went out for food and drinks every night. Some nights we were late in returning to the hotel. Some nights we returned to the hotel to wait a while to get our key and on one of the last nights were told to take our key with us in future (when it clearly states in the hotel to not take any hotel property out-with the hotel). We were in Santorini for a wedding so we really needed an iron. Again it’s advertise on the Epavlis website under room services and hotel services that they can provide an iron. We asked the long haired guy at reception for the iron and he told us they didn’t have one. I challenge the fact that it was advertised that the hotel could provide an iron, he reluctantly said he would check. We did, in the end, come back that day to find an iron on the room!!! The advertised WiFi does not work in the rooms. The taps in the room are so tight and difficult to use and at times we had to run the taps for about 20 minutes to get hot water to come through. The hotel location is great. As it’s on the hill it gives a great view. The pool area is very nice and peaceful. Dimitri in the pool bar was the nicest person we met. There is a simple pool menu and he works hard to serve customers and provide what we asked for. He also made conversation and didn’t make us feel that we were an inconvenience.We had breakfast once. There is a nice range to choose from.The hotel is very clean and could have been such a great place to stay for the week if the staff were friendly and inviting. ","May 26, 2019","11    Epavlis Hotel

587,"Prior to our arrival in Santorini, I had booked a private transfer with the hotel from the ferry port to the hotel. On arrival there was no sign of a driver from the hotel or a sign with my name. After 20 minutes I rang the hotel. I was told to “look for a black van with a young man driving it”. (To give context tens of vehicles pass through the port, it’s very busy and a large majority are black vans). This made it impossible to find the driver. After another 40 minutes I rang the hotel again. This time the staff member said “I don’t know what else to tell you”. I asked the staff member to please ring the driver and get him to meet us outside one of the ferry offices. After another 10-15 minutes the driver found us...we received no apology for the mistake and were informed we would receive €5 off our transfer. On arrival to the hotel, the staff member that I dealt with over the phone was at reception. He didn’t apologise for the hour long wait in mid day heat either. We received absolutely no information on the hotel facilities, breakfast times etc. When we checked into our room we realised that there was no phone service or WiFi in the room which meant we had to sit out at the pool day or night if we wished to use our phones at all. There was no batteries in our safe or in the air conditioning remote so we had to request these the next day.The pool facilities are nice and the breakfast was plentiful and had a wide choice which was good. There is a bar at the hotel which serves a small selection of food which we didn’t try. In terms of location it’s situated very near Kamari beach which was very nice, especially at night for going out to eat at the beach restaurants. The customer service leaves a lot to be desired. We found the staff generally uninterested, unhelpful and unfriendly. When we were checking out, the hotel tried to charge us €200 more than the agreed price and I had to show my confirmation email to prove the agreed price- which again we received no apology for. Overall, the facilities are good except for the lack of WiFi and phone reception in the room, great location in Kamari. However, given the bad service we won’t be staying again.","May 25, 2019","11    Epavlis Hotel

588,"Absolutely smashing place. Mrs C and I felt really well looked after. I’ve no idea where some of the people are coming from with the negative reviews. Exaggerating at best. Seriously. How unkind! The staff are really helpful, polite and there if needed. They give you space but you know they’ll be there at the drop of a hat. I love the comments about one lady being grumpy. I think it’s fair to say she is a morning person but wow does she keep a tight ship. Responsible for pretty much all the housekeeping and catering, she and her team work tirelessly to keep the place clean, tidy and welcoming. The facilities are excellent and the location is spot on. Near enough and far enough. And forget about the Sunset of the North, the Sun rise in the south here is gorgeous. Lastly, a shout for Dimitri. Thoroughly attentive, helpful and hardworking, this charming chap could not do any more to make you stay a special one. An absolute legend!Been here nearly two weeks and already planning our return.

589,"The hotel could be OK but the photos on the internet will not show the surroundings: there is construction work going on all around the place; dirt roads around and huge piles of garbage just about 50 meters under the hotel. Located at the very end of the village up a dark road not sure if its very safe at night walking all by yourself.Hot water will only come once you let the water run for at least 20-30 minutes.The password for the wifi did not seem to work but the owner did not seem to care. The kitchen did not look and smell very clean. Owner is an old woman, rude and low class with no communication skills at all. One of those locals who managed to rake in money to burn due to endless tourism in Santorini but no manners at all and she thinks she can treat people like crap.All in all there are countless much nicer hotels at far better locations along the beach. If I were you I would not stay in Kamari at all because it's a low level tourist trap compared to other parts of the island and it also lacks character; the beaches and the atmosphere are much nicer in Perivolos and Perissa as well as the beach bars and restaurants / food is in a much bigger variation and more authentic elsewhere. But if you have to stay in Kamari then go down the beach and choose one of those nice hotels just 5-10 meters from the beach.","April 5, 2019","11    Epavlis Hotel

590,"Did not find the people in the hotel as friendly as other creek hotels we've stayed in, yes it was very clean and housekeeping visited daily but found the other staff to be less welcoming. It is a steep hill to the hotel and yes there are a lot of steps once in there a life that will take you to the first floor, we ended up in a room that of course the lift didn't reach, despite us being twice as old as the others that were checking in at the same time. The rooms are adequate in size, you need to request a kettle from reception and there is an extra 3 euro tourist tax a day to pay. Breakfast is a miss mash of things, fried eggs, cooked meats, pizza, pastries and fruit. We received a call on the last night asking what time we was leaving as check out was 11.30, then on the day were were leaving the others waiting for the bus said they had not had a call and reception had told them they could have stayed in room till bus came. Whilst we were there we also watched the staff start to put thins away for the end of season even though there were people still arriving. Also be careful when sing hot tub, my 2 silver necklaces and when oxidised ( really black), the lady in next apartment advised me her bracelet was ruined by the minerals etc in the hot tub,","October 27, 2018","11    Epavlis Hotel

591,"Just got back from a week staying at Epavlis Hotel. Lovely, clean room with daily housekeeping. Beautiful pool and sea views from the balcony. Great variety of choice for the breakfast buffet. The hotel is at the top of quite a big hill & our room was right at the top of a few flights of stairs but the views when you get to the top make it worth it. The pool bar was good - we had lunch there a couple of times and drinks. The barman (not sure of his name) was fab! Would definately recommend.","September 30, 2018","11    Epavlis Hotel

592,"We loved this hotel. There were glitches. For example,when we arrived, the hotel had no room for us for our first night. However the receptionist was fantastic (really friendly, cooperative and funny) - as she was all week - and we were accommodated for the night in a new apartment block 200 yards down the road. Really, really comfortable so no problem - and had the side benefit of getting our cases transported to our room on the top floor for us, so - happy days!!Room was superb. Spotlessly clean, well furnished, very comfortable The daily climb up the steps was well worth the facilities and the view from the balcony.Breakfast offered an unusual selection but there was always something for us and it was delicious. Staff were excellent.We are not pool people but had lunch there twice. Dimitri was superb - he prepared the best Greek salad of several we had during the week. A genuinely good guy.As a pair of normal 60 year olds, we were not disadvantaged in the slightest by the walk up the hill and cannot speak highly enough of our week.So, overall, can't relate to some of the moans about the receptionist, no lift, steep hill etc. Just enjoy a great experience with lovely hosts.. Thank you all. Get a car to explore the island.Definitely eat at Navy's - the best of its type we have ever used on any Greek island","September 19, 2018","11    Epavlis Hotel

595,"My wife, 15 year old son and I stayed here at the end of July and into August. When we arrived we were warmly welcomed by reception staff and taken to our room on the second floor. Our room was spacious, clean and the furniture seemed relatively new. From the balcony we had a fantastic view of the sea (see photo), the air con worked well it was good that the room had both a small fridge and safe.There was a very relaxed atmosphere at the hotel and whilst I have noted some of the other experiences we found the staff on reception to be very polite and helpful. When we were looking at visiting other parts of the island they would advise us on the best places to visit and how to get there, they couldn't have been more helpful. The cleaning staff were always polite and did a great job of keeping our room and parts of the hotel spotless.Dimitri the barman runs the bar and pool area in a professional manner and works very hard. We didn't spend every day by the pool but when there he got very busy with orders at Lunch and probably could have done with some help. Wherever we go we always try a Mojito cocktail and we have to say that Dimitri's are the best we have ever had! The breakfast was generally very good, we didn't see any chips but there was pizza on a couple of occasions. There is however a wide range of choice and we never had what I'd describe as a bad breakfast. The lady organising the food at breakfast also worked very hard.The hotel is on a hill and whilst it can feel like a bit of a drag walking back when it's hot you soon get used to it, on the flip side once at the hotel the views are great.Overall we had a great stay here and would go back again, it was a bit too quiet for my 15 year old son but the 'banter' with Dimitri kept him entertained when we were at the pool!","August 16, 2018","11    Epavlis Hotel

598,"This hotel is in a wonderful location, being away from the main shopping/eating areas of Kamari, therefore quiet. It's only a few minutes walk to the beach and all the restaurants. Yes there is a hill, which did get tiring by the end of the holiday, and inside the hotel there are a lot of steps, but the views more than make up for this slight inconvenience. The hotel is spotlessly clean, lovely toiletries in the room and clean towels are provided every day. Breakfast was full of choices, some a little weird to the UK palate, but always something nice to eat. A special mention must go to Dimitri the pool barman who works tirelessly on his long shift to make sure everyone is happy and served promptly. As another reviewer commented, he must be exhausted at the end of his day! The pool is very nice with extremely comfortable sunbeds and a profusion of towels. There is also a gym, sauna and jacuzzi which doesn't seem to be very well advertised. The staff in this hotel are super helpful and unfailingly polite.

599,"Our first impression of the hotel was that it’s a pleasant, traditional looking Greek family run hotel. Yes there’s a steep incline up to the entrance from the beachfront, however being 30 and relatively fit this didn’t bother us. However definitely something to consider if you’re elderly, disabled or unfit. There was confusion on check in as we were told our room wasn’t available. This did annoy me, however we were given a temporary room for the first night and then upgraded to a very nice superior sea view room for the remainder of our holiday. This room was fantastic, however we did have to carry our own luggage up 3 flights of stairs as there is no elevator and/or assistance from staff.Despite other reviews, I found the ladies on the front desk to be pleasant and very helpful. They answered our questions daily and even helped sort out transportation to and from a restaurant we wanted to visit. Whenever I’ve visited Greece I’ve always found the people to be friendly and this was no different.The pool area is really good and adequate. It’s very small but there are enough sun beds to go around and even at full capacity there is enough room in the pool. This area gets sun all throughout the day so perfect if you’re a serial sunbather.There is a pool bar that offers drinks and food, however this is staffed by one man who does all the cooking, cleaning and serving. He did a fantastic job but he must be shattered by the end of the day!Breakfast was typical continental style with the addition of daily Greek delicacies. I really enjoyed it, however after a week it did get slightly repetitive and samey.The location was perfect as it’s just off the main drag but close enough to walk to. I was very surprised at how nice and modern Kamari was and the beachfront restaurants and bars really do stand out from most other resorts i’ve been to.","July 10, 2018","11    Epavlis Hotel

602,"I have nothing negative to say about this hotel. Yes the hotel sits on a hill as stated when we booked. You get use to it. Wouldn't be ideal for pushchairs or people who struggle to walk but I managed to do it with a broken foot.We stayed in room 103. Amazing view across kamari. Room was cleaned daily with fresh towels provided. Free air conditioning and free safety deposit box. Bed was comfortable. All in all the room was fit for purpose. Only had breakfast once. It's continental style with the usual eggs, cheese, fruit, bread etc. Can sit inside or on a little terrace overlooking the sea. Nice way to start your day.Pool - on not one occasion did we ever find we couldn't get a sun lounger. No getting up at 6am to put towels down. Many days we would go out in the morning and come in around lunch and still get a bed. The barman around the pool works his little socks off. Cooking, serving and cleaning. All food near the pool was of an excellent standard.All other staff we encountered were very pleasant and polite. We found the lady on reception very helpful, sorted us taxis to get us to fira and oia. Nothing was too much trouble. A very lovely lady.

603,"The Epavlis Hotel is a beautiful resort with views of the ocean from many of the rooms and the pool. The breakfast is good. The pool area is nice and the bartender/waiter is outstanding. But the bartender is the only member of the hotel staff who is customer friendly. The ladies running the front desk are not warm and welcoming. It feels like you are imposing on them if you ask a question. This is my biggest complaint. This hotel would be a challenge for anyone who has difficulty climbing steps or walking on an incline. The hotel is on multiple levels with an elevator that only goes up one floor so be prepared to haul your luggage if you have a room upstairs. If you book on the lobby level or one floor up you should be fine. You do have to climb a flight of stairs to get to the lobby area. The Epavlis sits on a hill, giving you that great view. In order to get to the beach or into the town you will need to walk down the hill. The return walk up the hill is tough if you are not in shape or if it is very hot outside. It was also about a 10-15 minute walk to get into the center of town. We were fine with this in early June, but it might be tough in July or August!","June 5, 2018","11    Epavlis Hotel

I've seen others complain about the walk up the hill to the hotel but it's really not all that bad and a small price to pay to be off the strip but within striking distance of everything you might need.

Having booked a sea view room with outdoor hot tub imagine our disappointment arriving back to open the door and find out that we were opposite a construction site. A sister Hotel is being built opposite the rooms at the right hand side of the Hotel (as you walk up to it). Rooms 109 & 111 are affected by this as are others. Obviously this was unsatisfactory and we were not happy requesting a change of room in the morning alongside others. The staff did their very best in difficult circumstances and later that day we were relocated into a much better room. As it is a sister Hotel being built the owners have full knowledge of possible distress and discomfort that could be caused by this development. When it is near full capacity in July and August there will be little or no capacity to change rooms therefore it may be advisable to check which room you are being allocated before you arrive.Our second room was very spacious, sea view, good outdoor jacuzzi , clean and comfortable. There are good facilities at the Hotel decent pool, good bar, games room and library. The staff were helpful, friendly and courteous throughout breakfast was okay.It is well located at the edge of Kamari although on a hill not suitable if you have difficulty walking . Kamari has a good vibrant feel about it good choice of bars and eateries with a regular bus service to Fira (Thira). Bus stop a couple of minutes down the hill also the best part of the beach is below the Hotel. There is good walking to be had up the ancient Thera descending to Perissa. You can either walk back from Perissa, catch the water taxi or donkeys. Whilst the rest of our stay was good it was unfortunately blighted by the loss of a day if we had been advised in advance we could have made different arrangements.Note the construction work is due to finish September.","May 30, 2018","11    Epavlis Hotel

Halfway into our stay we heard of a family tragedy and they went out of their way to help us try and arrange flights home with local services.The walk to and from the hotel into Kamari was short and after a few days you get used to the return walkGood library and games room plus an indoor poolLooking forward to next year","November 27, 2017","11    Epavlis Hotel

608,"Myself and my wife spent the last week of the season at the hotel so it was quiet with probably not more than 7 or 8 rooms occupied out of 45. We had delux room 126 which was great - nice very comfortable 4 poster bed, fridge and safe(no charge). Clean towels every day. Very large terrace with 2 sun beds and a hot tub jacuzzi (yes, it was hot!) with a superb sea view. As it was the last week of the season in Kamari, a lot of bars and restaurant were closing but there were still some very good restaurants nearby. The walk back to the hotel is up a bit of an incline but you get used to it over the week! Overall, a very enjoyable stay and we would recommend this lovely hotel.","October 30, 2017","11    Epavlis Hotel

609,"We spent 5 days in Epavlis Hotel. We choose a room with sea view and private jacuzzi on the terrasse. ROOM : beautiful room, very clean, we had a very good bed. JACUZZI: be very careful !!! It's not hot tube !!! The water was so cold we didn't even spend 5 min in it. We complain at the reception but it didn't change anything... this was so disappointing. FOOD : Hôtel breakfast is good with a lot of choices. Restaurants around are very touristic so not very good except for one : Pinakio restaurant 5/10 mn by food). You really should reserved a table because it's full every evening and it's the best ratio price/quality we found. CRUISE : we did a very good trip on a beautiful boat (replica from pirate boat of XIX century). We booked it with the hotel and it was perfect (volcano hiking + swim in hot springs + dinner with white wine + Oia sunset with sax player. ACTIViTIES : everything in the hotel is for money, even the billard... too bad !! You pay a cold jacuzzi on ur terrasse and u have to pay again if u want the warn one inside.... it's a shame ! TRANSPORT : we rent a quad for 2 days to visit Pyrgos and to go on red beach, black beach... it really worth it. But be careful, at the Harbor some taxi companies try to make u pay 15€/person, u can find 10€/person. We took a transport by the hotel to the harbor when we left and the charge is 12,5€/person. I was surprised and disappointed, I thought hotel transport will be the same price but it's more expensive so... don't trust so much the hotel even if the staff was nice... at the beginning I wanted to put 5* but with the jacuzzi and transport problem I put only 3*... too bad !

610,"Hotel was clean and room comfortable but the manager is vile. We arrived to be told our room wasn't ready and that we would have to stay in another hotel and that they would pick us up first thing in the morning to bring us back. We had to get in the managers husbands very beat up filthy old car to be taken to a grim hotel. We were up first thing to be collected but unfortunately no show from anyone. We had to get the hotel to keep phoning to get us picked up. Eventually we were picked up just after lunch. As we were there for only 5 days this really ate into our time there. Breakfast was not nice and very basic. Apart from this we had an amazing time in Santorini. Hotel is ok location, yes a 10 min walk from restaurants, beach etc but to be honest all the other hotels are right on the strip. Easy to hire a quad bike and ride up to Oia and Fira.

611,"This is an attractive, clean, stylish hotel with great sea views. It's at one end on the town and is quiet and convenient. Breakfast is good, and the coffee was excellent. They serve lunches at the bar but we didn't partake. Pool area is small - ish but there always seemed to be sunbeds (comfortable by the way) available. Water was cold.There are lots of steps and the hotel is on a slight hill so not comfortable in the heat or if you have any difficulties (or aversion to) walking.The room maids and breakfast staff were friendly and unobtrusive.However, the main issue we had with this hotel was that we never really felt welcome from the moment we were checked in by an unsmiling staff member. We don't expect hotel staff to be our new best friends but there was a lack of warmth in the welcome and in the attitude of some of the staff which was distinctly off - putting.

WiFi is spotty downstairs but good in the lobby & pool area. We love the pool and the beach accessibility.

Not many people have mentioned this, but the hotel is self catering, however, if are not allowed to take and if you're own food or drink around the pool area, they demand you to buy their over priced drinks and poor quality food from their bar everyday.

615,"Stayed here as a group of 4 in June 2017. Hotel was clean, staff were friendly and check-in was a breeze.Epavlis is quite a quiet hotel, the location is good, with a short walk to most of Kamari!Rooms - fairly standard, beds comfy although a little noisy. Air con works well and the bathroom has everything you need, although some rooms may have an awkwardly placed showerhead holder (stayed in 2 different rooms there). Sea view is a must, balcony makes a difference!Food/drink - bar is well stocked, barman friendly and happy to help. Had food from there which was average, salad was good, burger ok, and sandwich not great. Breakfast is also just ok, lots of selection but not sure all the cooked items were fresh.Amenities - 2 pools to the hotel, one small indoor pool which is great for cooling off in the quiet away from the sun, outdoor pool is also good, very clean and a good size. Small games room at the hotel, table tennis is free but the pool table is charged for. Conclusion - nice hotel tucked away from the main crowd of Kamari, fairly priced and with everything required.","July 8, 2017","11    Epavlis Hotel

616,"Myself and my new husband have just returned from our honeymoon where we spent an amazing 2 weeks in Santorini and stayed at The Epavlis.The nit picking in the earlier reviews is really unfair so if you want a true to form review continue reading.Yes the hotel is on a slight hill, if your an elderly old lady then this hotel isn't for you but it really isn't a massive problem it's not like it's Mt Everest. We liked it being away from the hustle and bustle of the main strip where a lot of the other hotels are situated. The walk down to the bars, restaurants is just a few minutes away. On arrival we were greeted by Cristina whom by the end of the 2 weeks we had struck up a lovely friendship with. We would go and see her most mornings and she would advise on how to get to the places we wanted to visit, bus routes etc.She even jumped on the back of a scooter and came down to the bus stop we were waiting at for a boat trip, which turned out to be the wrong one! She didn't have to do it but she did and booked us a taxi to enable us to still make it to the port in time.The rest of the staff work like trojans. The cleaning maid is always smiling and says hello, rooms were always spotlessly clean and fresh towels everyday. The breakfasts were lovely and typically Greek with yoghurt, fresh fruits, pastries, eggs but no English breakfast which was fine by us, your in Greece, embrace the food! The barman was always fun, joking around and served us lovely pizzas and sandwiches at lunch time.All in all this hotel works amazingly well for a small team of about 6 people that keep it running from day to day. To top it off we were upgraded on our last night to a seaview room with a jacuzzi, something we never expected but were very happy to accept.Oh and Maria whom people refer to as miserable is a very lovely lady if you take the time to speak to her and not moan about petty little things! Her English is not the greatest so I think she's just very misunderstood.We will definitely return here again for many anniversaries to come!!!!","June 30, 2017","11    Epavlis Hotel

623,"We had a lovely ten night stay at this hotel. The positives far outweigh the negatives to the point that we are looking to book and stay again! It has a lovely sea view from the pool and most of the rooms. Unfortunately, as I was travelling in a three, we had a larger room, situated at the back of the building. This resulted in no view and the room smelt slightly foisty after a few days as we had no real chance to let fresh air in unless we left our balcony door open. This didn't put us off at all though as we were hardly in it. The staff were lovely, particularly the bar man, Mado, who is a credit to the hotel. He was very helpful and was able to recommend the best places to eat and things to see. He also makes a wonderful cup of tea! :)The beach, shops and restaurants are all very close to the hotel, all that stands between you is a slight hill. Being rather unfit this was a killer to start with, but as the holiday went by I started to power up it.Overall a fantastic holiday and hotel, but one to definitely do in flat shoes!

Meadow (apologies if I've spelt that wrong) welcomed us back too and was on hand to help with our luggage. The pool area is charming with plenty of beds and umbrellas as well as a bar which Meadow runs making all manner of delicious drinks including the best Pina Colada I've had in a long time!Walking to the beachfront is a short 5 minute stroll and then there is a whole host of bars and restaurants to choose from.Breakfast each morning is a variety of pastries, cold meats, cheeses, eggs, toast etc which can be enjoyed either inside or outside on the terrace.If walking up & down the hill to the beachfront isn't quite enough exercise, Epavlis also has an indoor gym offering a treadmill, bike, stepper and a selection of weight machines.

631,"Our Situation We wanted a few days in warm Santorini in October for our Anniversary. We booked this holiday months in advance and paid next to nothing for flights and accommodation, 2nd week of October is the end of the high season – many establishments were closing for the end of season and this is likely to have contributed to the low cost of this trip. We travel quite often and generally stay in 4 Star plus hotels, this hotel is definitely not one! I am glad that we had booked a second hotel in Oia for our actual Anniversary celebration. Pros Very Close to Kamari beach Lots of ATV/Car hire options nearby You can book excursions via the Reception Desk Rooms were clean (bathrooms – see cons) Pool/sunbed area is nice enough Great coffee made by Mado at the bar We visited in low season so it was all quite slow and relaxed – could be both a pro and a con There is so much to see and do in Santorini, that we literally used the hotel to sleep and showerCons Rooms are old fashioned Pillows are cheap and not fluffy, 2 per person are definitely required Bathrooms – the seal around the tub is old and permanently stained, I have to be honest I hated using the bathroom, it was clean but it was so dark and dingy with permanent stains, not at all modern, the shower is a stand in the bath shower The hotel manager has RBF (resting b face) so don’t expect any smiles are gratitude at your choice to stay at Hotel Epavlis from her. She does not smile, I even smiled at her but still no smiles although she did get me two glasses one day when I asked her for some late at night. Regarding her attitude, I am not sure if this is just the Greek way though, I noticed this attitude with many people across Santorini, they don’t smile for the sake of smiling – perhaps I am just to accustomed to Western Customer Service. Breakfast leaves much to be desired, there are stray cats hanging about the place as you eatGeneral RecommendationsDo the Volcano excursion, it is truly remarkableGo to Ancient Thira, it is incredibleDefinitely do the sunset trip to Oia Hire a car or an ATV as the views while driving around are something else If you visit in October, be sure to take sweaters and long pants for the evening because the wind is no joke!

634,"Like Charlotte E, I was also asked on arrival if I would be willing to go and stay at another hotel, for reasons that the lady on reception couldn't give me. (Later I was told there was a problem with the plumbing in my room). I was moved just down the road to the Crown Suites, which was lovely, although more of an upmarket slightly characterless boutique hotel, whereas what I wanted was something that felt a bit more Greek, which the Epavlis is. I stayed at the Crown Suites for three nights before moving back to the Epvalis, and then wished I'd dug my heels in on arrival, as the view from my room was gorgeous, and that, I realised too late, was the thing that I'd really paid for when I booked weeks earlier. The hotel gave me a complimentary bottle of wine to say thanks. I'd definitely rather have just stayed at the Epvalis throughout, had that view, and not had the inconvenience of having to pack and move hotels mid-holiday.I am surprised to read the comments about grumpy staff on here, that was not my experience at all. I found the staff really helpful whenever I needed info on local sights or taxis ordering. The rooms are fairly basic but spacious and well serviced. It's well worth paying the little bit extra for the sea view. Breakfast is decent, better than I've found in many Greek hotels.The hotel is slightly set back from the promenade of shops and restaurants along the front, but I liked that, it felt a little quieter, and it was only a 5 minute walk to shops, restaurants and the beach. There are lots of ok, fairly indistinguishable Greek tavernas near the hotel. I didn't have a bad meal all week. The best meals I had were at Meli & Thymari, Almira and Black Stone (which looks like a pub but the food was a really pleasant surprise).Kamari is a very sweet little seaside town. It's very easy to get a bus to Fira, from where you can connect to other parts of the island. The best activity I did was walk from Fira up to Oia. Quite long (12km I think), hilly and gravelly in parts, so don't attempt it in sandals. But spectacular views along the way. The Ancient Thira site, on the hill directly behind the Epavlis, is also very worth a visit.","October 3, 2016","11    Epavlis Hotel

635,"This is by far the worst hotel we have ever been to , we were put in a triple room not the deluxe room we paid £1800 for yes it had a outdoor jacuzzi but it wasn't private it was on a stairwell that anyone could come up to so far from private as for the other balcony being a seaview you could see tiny bits of sea,the room stank of smoke but apparently Maria thinks this is down to preference, our bath leaked and apparently we didn't know how to use it, no baths in the uk? It's a absolute joke, if you want a nice holiday santorini is lovely but stay away from this hotel it's like fawlty towers, and if you don't know what that is Maria have a look on you tube you may just laugh.By the way I've tapped 1 circle to rate shame there's no minus !!","September 30, 2016","11    Epavlis Hotel

The location was perfect a short walk down to the Kamari strip with loads of lovely restaurants and bars. Mado at the bar was extremely friendly and was able to recommend many places to go and see!

637,"We booked a half board package at this hotel from the 20/9 for 7 nights. At our check in when we asked what time dinner was served we were told to come down later and the system would be explained. The system for anyone on a half board package is that you are given a voucher to go to one of two local tavernas every evening for your meal. The receptionist told us that we could have anything at all at the restaurants and would only need to pay for our drinks. In fact it turned out that at both of the restaurants you were given a separate menu to choose from. One of th e restaurants we found very poor with a limited choice but the other one is excellent with a good choice of both starters and mains. At no time when we booked had we been told that our evening meals would be away from the hotel. As seen in other reviews the hotel is at the top of a fairly steep hill which for us even being 60 somethings was o.k. but then once you get to the hotel there are 20 steps to get into the reception. We had booked a superior room which was on the top floor so altogether to get to the room we had to climb 80 steps the last 30 of which are extremely steep. The room had a beautiful view of the bay and the sunrise and being at the top was very quiet but we would recommend that anyone with mobility problems should avoid this hotel even if you are in a low level room as there are lots of small flights of stairs all over the hotel. The hotel is exceptionally clean but breakfast was very mediocre and hot things weren't hot . We went to the bar one evening, and asked for coffee and the barman was very off hand and said the coffee machine had been closed down for the day so we would have to wait for him to boil a kettle. Very few people used the bar in the evenings it seemed to us and with this attitude you can understand why. We had a leak from under the bath everytime we used the shower and although we reported it it wasn't repaired for the whole week so we insisted that towels were put down as the amount of water leaking made it dangerous and I must say that the cleaners did do this daily. The manager did offer us another room but we declined as we thought it would get repaired and we liked being in the room where we were. Santorini is beautiful and we would go again but think twice about this hotel if you do have any mobility problems and I agree with other reviewers that it is probably more a 3 star than a 4.","September 28, 2016","11    Epavlis Hotel

Fira is within a ten minute walk where you will find lots of restaurants, bars and supermarkets. We hired a car and the owners arranged everything for us.

Above all the staff at this hotel went over & beyond! They set up a winery tour for us & also set up an ATV that we used to explore the island. Our flight was early in the morning & the taxi was set up for us with no issues. Since we left so early they even made sure to return the ATV keys to the company. I've never had such great service & they do it with a genuine smile. I can definitely tell they truly love making sure their guests have a great stay!

647,"I stayed at Villa Rose as part of a wedding party. Villa Rose is run by mother and daughter Maria and Kiki. Before arriving I had several email exchanges with them asking various questions which were always answered very promptly. Transfers were arranged for us to and from the airport. In addition a lift was also arranged for me and some of the other guests on the day of the wedding to the wedding meeting point. The accommodation was fairly basic but extremely adequate and comfortable. It was cleaned meticulously every day as were all of the outdoor areas. Slippers were provided as were large towels that were changed every day. The toiletries provided are olive oil based and very nice. The room was well stocked with cutlery, pans, plates, glasses etc. The fridge was stocked with basic provisions such as croissants, butter, orange juice, milk, water, crackers, a small carafe of wine. There was a coffee machine and coffee pods provided. All of theses provisions were replenished on a daily basis,The outdoor area although quite small was quite sufficient. There is a small pool and a Jacuzzi pool. There are several extremely comfortable sun loungers, a comfortable cushioned seating area as well as stand alone seats around tables in a shaded area. Towels are provided for use outdoors and there is a basket of sun creams.Villa Rose is situated about 10 minutes walk out of town, about 5 minutes walk from the supermarket and about 3 minutes walk from the most fantastic 24 hour bakery. The bus station is a few minutes walk away. There is ""The Coffee Lab"" close by which was frequented by some of our party and received the accolade of being one of the best coffee shops visited. If you turn right out of Villa Rose, heading away from town, there are several eateries. On the opposite side of the road a few minute away are a couple of tavernas which serve delicious Greek food and are very reasonable compared to in the town. In the town there are two very nice places to eat. One called Da Costa which overlooks the sea and is a great place to watch the beautiful sunset from. The other is an Italian restaurant in the heart of town called Convivium where the food is delicious. Villa Rose does not have a view but that is made up 100 fold by Maria, Kiki and the staff. I can honestly say that I have never, in my many years of travel, felt so well looked after as I was at Villa Rose. Nothing was ever too much trouble. An example is when I asked if there was another hair dryer I could use as the one in the room was not very powerful. The next day I was provided with a brand new hair dryer. One of our group had a baby and the staff washed and dried some of her bibs and clothes. Maps and bus timetables were provided and verbal recommendations and directions given and always with a smile. I could not have felt more welcome. If you are looking for somewhere out of town I would 100% recommend Villa Rose.","August 22, 2018","12    Villa Rose

The pool area was lovely, always clean and enough beds for us, the staff were so accommodating and pleasant at all times, the cleaners did an amazing job every morning and worked so hard, fresh towels and bedding regularly throughout the week and always pleasant with a smile on their face. Free transfers to and from the airport (which was super handy as cabs can be expensive). Fridge was restocked every morning with yoghurt, croissants, crackers, juice and wine and staff were always on hand to provide any extras we asked for.

The staff, the friendliness and the value for money more than make up for any view and it’s good to be out of the hectic centre too.

They clean everywhere to the highest of standards, not just individual apartments but the communal areas too. Maria leaves little thoughtful touches all over the Villa - suncream for everyone to use, a little caraf of wine in your room. The staff not only cleaned our room but would artistically fold our pyjamas. It is just the sweetest place! I would not hesitate to book it again. We found Santorini to be a very buy place and much of the accommodation extremely expensive. When we booked Villa Rose we were worried because it seemed so reasonable - we thought it might not be very good. How wrong we were. It's within walking distance of the main town but yet far enough away to escape from the crowds. It's full off character and charm and feels like a much loved and cared for business.

654,"I planned my Santorini trip so that I have 1 hotel night in Fira and 2 hotel nights in Oia. I pack light so I do not mind switching hotels. I'm glad I chose Villa Rose for my first night. The free pick-up from airport to hotel was quick - 15 minutes. Pick-up at airport is up to 8:30 PM. So best to arrange your flight to arrive before that time. Prior to arrival, the hotel sent me instructions as to how to get to the hotel on my own in case my flight is delayed. It would have been easy for taxis to find the hotel as it is along a road and near a gas station. My room was on the ground floor at the rearside of the property. This was good because as mentioned, Villa Rose is along a road and I imagine one can hear traffic noise if the room is not at the rear. I imagine my room to be ideal for people who have difficulty ascending and descending stairs. The bathroom is small though and not wheelchair-accessible.The hosts are a mother and daughter team, Maria and Kiki. I cannot say enough good things about them. They are so sweet and helpful. It's very reassuring for a first-time solo visitor to Santorini to have such welcoming hosts. Maria gave me tips on where to eat. how to walk to the main hub of Fira. There is no view of the caldera here. Following her suggestion, I had breakfast at Mylonas, a patisserie 5 mins from the hotel before walking up to the center of Fira. It only took me less than 15 minutes to reach the pedestrian walkway where you can start seeing views of the caldera. Along the way, I passed by a bus station. The hotel would be convenient for people who prefer to take buses in Santorini. My room was spotless and comfortable. There's enough outlets to plug my devices. Wifi was a bit slow. The ref was stock with yogurt, water and cake. Villa Rose is a good option for people on a light budget, do not mind the absence of caldera views, want A/C and willing to walk 15 minutes to reach the main drag of Fira. This can be also good for families with little children - they can gather around the hotel yard with a small pool after a long day of exploring Santorini.","November 2, 2017","12    Villa Rose

It is around 5-7mins walk there which was fine for us. They have plenty of parking in front of the property. They do provide basic breakfast items.

661,"I had the most amazing 4 nights at Villa Rose.I was greeted by the wonderful Lady on reception who immediately gave me a run down of the island, ideas on whether to eat and to see the best sunset. She gave me so many options! She appears to a very genuine and helpful friendly lady.I was shown my room which was very cute. Nice double bed and very modern and warm. I loved it! The bathroom was compact yet absolutely sufficient. I was advised that there are complimentary items in the fridge which will be replaced daily. There was the following:Wine, croissants, water, fruit juice, tea and coffee, cream and pots and pans in the cupboard. I was seriously amazed as Villa Rose is so affordable. One day I was talking to the lady on reception and there was a big bowl of sweets, I asked if I could take one and she obliged. When I came back that evening, there was a personalised note thanking me for my custom along with a bowl of these sweets! Such a nice personal touch. It's a great location, walking distance to Fira, however, I hire a quad bike. So much easier to get around and park. Stay here! You won't be disappointed :) Thank you for such a lovely stay.

Picked us up from the port, had a welcome drink and snacks ready, our room was lovely and tidy and air conditioning was a plus as it was 35deg most days! An outdoor pool with sun soaking area as well as an area to sit and relax undercover. We stayed in the 2 bedroom apartment, the fridge was stocked with goodies which was so lovely. They allowed us to leave our luggage there as our boat wasn't leaving until later and even dropped us off at port when we were ready. Very kind. Very close to town centre to get food, or do a bit of shopping. Hire a 4 wheeler and hit the road to some of the gorgeous beach settings they have around! MUST DO - Boat trip, Villa rose can organize day boat trips, i HIGHLY recommend this, we went on a boat trip the food and alcohol was all included in the cost and it was the highlight of our trip, amazing scenery, delicious food and GREAT service.

This comprised a good sized bedroom and bathroom with a well equiped kitchenette. There is a small balcony on one side and outside a shared patio. The room is quiet, clean and comfortable. Downstairs there is a very nice pool with table and chairs and lounges. It is a great area to relax in. Wifi is also provided.What puts this place above others is the extras provided free. The small carafe of wine, water, juice, apples and other food for breakfast. Muffins with the coffee, peanuts and soft drinks around the pool.Another bonus is the free airport shuttle. Maria could not be more generous in making the stay memorable.Villa Rose is located on the main road. There are plenty of cafes and restaraunts in easy walking distance.

That is only the locational advantage of Villa Rose.The personal touches are the key contributors to our most pleasant of stays in any holiday rental. We were picked up at the airport. We were very throughly checked-in, ie provided with all the necessary information that will make our stay the best we could expect. From being picked up at the ferry terminal, to car-rentals, to dinner-reservations, we felt llike we had our personal conceirge. No need to worry about anything at all.The studio we had was most comfortable and well-provisioned. From toiletries to a very well-stocked refrigerator. We had juices, breakfast, fruits, mineral water and even a daily half-carafe of white Grecian wine. While we had to cook/prepare our breakfasts, it was easy-peasy, as all the necessary provisions are there. Everything!Each day, the studio was turned-over, Fresh towels, fresh stocks in the fridge and the half-carafe of wine. Even your stuff that has been thrown around would have been properly tidied. It's like having your invisible butler.We had a car arranged and we take short trips around the island.

686,"My boyfriend and I have just enjoyed what can only be described as a truly magical, exceptional holiday at the beautiful Villa Rose. My mum found this hotel online for us and I am so glad she did as Maria and her family are the most kind, welcoming, genuine hosts we have ever encountered. From the moment we arrived we knew this was a special place. Maria's husband was waiting for us at the airport and when we arrived at Villa Rose Maria gave us lots of invaluable information about Santorini, the local area and hotel facilities. Our room was beautifully decorated -bright & airy with a little kitchenette and very modern bathroom. We loved the power shower! One of the nicest touches and unexpected surprises was lots of goodies in the fridge everyday including orange juice, croissants, Greek yogurts and tea/coffee etc. We couldn't believe it when we came back each evening to find a basket of treats waiting for us ranging from delicious chocolate muffins to sweets and fresh fruit. I haven't experienced this kind of thing even in 5* hotels. It was so lovely and made you feel really special. Villa rose is in a perfect location - 10 minutes walk to central Fira with plenty of shops, restaurants and a fantastic bakery very close by. The pool area looks lovely although we never used it because we were out exploring most days and the hotel features all mod cons such as air conditioning, wifi and television. I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough - if you want to experience authentic Greek hospitality, enjoy bright & beautifully decorated rooms in an excellent location do not hesitate to book Villa Rose - you will not regret it. We cannot wait to return! Thank you to Maria, her husband and daughter for making our stay so very special. A beautiful gem in the heart of Santorini! ","May 19, 2016","12    Villa Rose

687,"Shah challenges anyone to find a friendlier family than Nikos, Maria, and their ever-smiling daughter, Kiki. They will take you in like family and make sure you have the best time possible in Santorini.This is a modest family-run inn with apartments and suites located about a ten-minute walk to the start of the Thira plaza and town centre. Nikos will pick you up and drop you to the airport at any time of day and night (Shah has no idea how he does it). Just make sure you give your arrival details when making the booking. For people on a budget, this is the perfect choice to have a very clean (actually, immaculate) room with all the conveniences of truly personalized service.So why did Shah not give it his coveted five-star rating? A couple of reasons. Shah booked two rooms and although the place was relatively empty, he did not get the quality of rooms promised on the phone when the booking was made for the special occasion of his visit. One of the rooms was at the front where it gets quite noisy because of the road nearby. But that's ok because Shah can sleep through anything.It was the other room that was a problem where the shower just didn't work. Shah believes it's important to wash oneself daily, especially while working up a sweat walking around the hilly streets of this unbelievably beautiful island. Even though the plumbing could not be fixed, given the relative vacancy of the place in early May, a room change should have been offered.Having said all that, it is certainly true that this is a very warm, friendly, and well-run place. Shah would come here again for sure, and his many fans should consider this when visiting Santorini. You won't get a view, but you also won't empty your wallet.Shah says: Rent a car from any of the places nearby (or ask Kiki) and go around the island on your own. If you get lost, then get a brain scan after your return. Rentals are quite inexpensive. Visit Red Beach (for sure), the lighthouse (for sure), Akrotiri (if you have time to visit the castle there), and do not miss Oia. Thira (Fira) is very nice, but Oia (Ia) is spectacular. Walk to the Oia castle to take that iconic picture.Shah's tip: When making a reservation, ask for a room toward the back of the hotel and away from the road. Unless you like the noise of traffic. Young men on their motorcycles like to make their Greek masculinity known quite early in the morning.Complementary extra tip: Although you will find some edible things in the fridge for the morning, just walk up the road (toward the city centre) and you will find a nice little bakery on the left, just past the gas station. It's about 200 m from the hotel. It opens early. You will get great coffee and a wide assortment of thingies to cause instant hyperglycemia.","May 9, 2016","12    Villa Rose

693,"We had a lovely warm welcome from Stelios when we arrived at Mandilaria Studios. The apartment was a great value place to stay when we spent a week in Santorini. The beaches and cafes of Perissa are a few minutes away by car, and Fira and other villages easily accessible from this location. Stelios gave us some good advice and information about the island without pushing trips or selling which we really appreciated. The room was a ground floor budget studio, and, to this end was basic but provided all we needed for our week. The main thing is, it was fresh and clean, with a good sized hot shower, fridge to keep the drinks chilled, ample parking and good WiFi connection too. A supermarket, with keen prices, is a two minute walk from the studios. Good for cheese and all the basics - though we did tend to eat out with so many restaurants and cafes over the island. Based on the ground floor, we could sit on the verandah facing the front garden, see a little sea and the mountain. One of the best things is the pool, which by Santorini standards, is a good size and private to the studios. We had the pool to ourselves nearly every time we swam and could dry off under the parasols and sun loungers. We would definitely recommend as a good value base for a holiday on this beautiful island.","December 7, 2017","13    Mandilaria Studios

AC was good. small refrigerator,TV w/a dozen channels(2 with english programming). Cleaned daily. Cooking utensils ,Hot plate & electric kettle provided. You WILL need a transformer(we found a great one on Amazon -small&inexpensive)Hotel Amenities: smaller size pool (maybe 10'x20') w/outdoor shower, WC & Bar & 14 lounge chairs(perfect for relaxing after day of sight seeing).Pool doesn't close if you keep the roar/volume down.You can rent ATVs and book some excursions here(DEFINITELY plan ahead)Location: Emporior(Car to get around would be ideal) since there are literally less that 40 taxis for an Island of 25K people(w/influx of people from 1-4 cruse ships almost daily).

695,"We stayed here for a week during a recent trip to Santorini. About 2km from the sea front (15-20 mins walk) and about 500 meters from the Emporio to Perissa main road with the supermarket on the corner. Agreed not in the busiest place, but certainly a lot lower priced than many, well located and quiet. Like a good number of guests in Santorini, we hired a quad making everywhere accessible in a few minutes. The studios are very clean and equipped with fridge, kettle and two ring hob, ample crockery etc. Nice balcony to the rooms with moderate sea views. Fair sized pool which is discreet and secluded (unlike many that we saw) Hotel staff are exceptionally helpful, happy to arrange transfers (cheaper than elsewhere), trips, car hire and anything else you want. Highly recommended","September 17, 2017","13    Mandilaria Studios

696,"I spent a week at Mandilaria Studios with my girlfriend this summer.Everything from arranging a taxi to pick us up at the airport at 4 in the morning, to greeting us as we arrived 20-30 minutes later, and preparing us a fine breakfast, very early in the morning.As we had a small fridge and some pots and pans in our room, we used the supermarket, that was right around the corner (2 minute walk), to have some breakfast ready and a few bottles of wine.We borrowed a few wine glasses and an icetray from the owner, who was also happy to help us with anything we needed.The helped us rent a quadbike to ride around on, and took their time to explain us the good places to go and how to best navigate around the island.Overall exceptional service and a great experience to stay here.Though I usually would not want to live in the same place twice, if I travel to the same country, I would definetely choose to live at Mandilaria Studios again, next time I go to Santorini - Which I definetely will, because the experience was amazing and I could easily spend another week of my life on this island.","July 7, 2017","13    Mandilaria Studios

698,"Recently stayed here while visiting Santorini, very happy with our stay! The service was great, we were provided with pocket maps of the island and local area, and given suggestions on tourist attraction etc. when we arrived. Our split-level apartment was self-catered with a small, equipped kitchen (pots, pans, cutlery, dishes, hob, fridge), spacious with the bedroom upstairs and the living area opening onto a small but lovely balcony with a table and two chairs and a sea view. The apartment is cleaned daily with fresh linen and towels provided. It's about a 15-20 minute walk to Perivolos & Perissa beaches where there's loads of restaurants, little shops and pubs to choose from. There is a local supermarket about a 2 minute walk away which was great for us, as we prepared some meals ourselves. Opposite this supermarket, you'll find the bus stop which goes to Thira (the main city of the island) where you can get links to Oia, Akrotiri/Red Beach and the Airport/Port for about 2.30 euros pp each way. It has a relatively quiet swimming pool at the back with deck chairs, umbrellas and tables, meaning you actually have a chance of getting in some sun bathing and swimming! I would definitely recommend this accommodation to anyone thinking of visiting the island and could see myself checking in again!","June 15, 2016","13    Mandilaria Studios

In the backyard there're two pools, one for swimming, sunbathing and one for kids. The backyard is great for relaxation. The beach is cca. 20 minutes walk from the apartment, the nearest supermarket is 100 m far. You can easily rent a quad, that's used for short rides around the island.

The room was pretty airy, with a fully-equipped kitchenette, quiet air-conditioner. Linen and towels changed daily. The owners (all members of family running this studios) were very friendly, helpful and extremely supportive. They work tirelessly to make sure their guests are happy and nothing is too much trouble for this charming people. We arrived early in the morning (about 7 AM) and they were waiting for us! The room was completely ready! We were also given a bottle of wine, fresh home pastries. And during our holidays sometimes we received fruits, vegetables from their garden. For us location of Mandilaria studios was perfect: it’s not near cafes, restaurants, discotheques, next to Carrefur shop where we could buy fresh food for our breakfasts, lunches and dinners. We hired a car for 2 weeks and explored beautiful Santorini. Every day we visited different places of this unforgettable island. I and my husband would like to thank the owners of the Mandilaria Studios for our perfect holydays. We hope that they make a success of the studios, because they are working hard at it, and wish them luck and prosperity!","June 22, 2015","13    Mandilaria Studios

The wifi and air conditioning both worked well. Though I didn't use the balcony, it had a cute little table and chair set, and a clothesline to hang wet swimming gear.

The pool is a great size and in a great spot so we got the sun all day! The owners are really nice and friendly and took us to and from the port for a small charge.HOWEVER (and this isn't really a 'but' because of the hotel) but it isn't in the best location if you wanted to be close to the main towns of Oía and Thira...which were quite a bus ride away (there wasn't much around the hotel but we were only in Santorini for 4 nights so we didn't actually venture to the main part of Perivolos)","February 26, 2014","13    Mandilaria Studios

It is a couple of km from the beach but if you have a car or bike its all good. Facilities on site are excellent, much superior to most places I have stayed on the island. The fact that you have a top supermarket a hundred metres away means that you can choose to eat in whenever you wish.

I had the pool to myself and Stelios opened the bar just for me and let me put my music on the pool sound system. They couldn't do enough for you-but this seems to be a Santorini trait- He even took me in his car to my next port of call in Perissa. so if you're on a strict budget this place is just what you need,"October 8, 2013","13    Mandilaria Studios

709,"The proprietor is a very nice woman, though she speaks no English (but I spoke enough Greek to communicate with her fluently). But her husband speaks very basic English, and they collaborate with an Athens-based agent who speaks multiple languages.The rooms and pool are nice. Note that the adjacent small pool by the big pool is a kiddie pool, not a hot tub.The garden in the front is tended by the proprietors and has some local vegetables when in season. It's quite lovely. The hotel is a bit hard to find, as most hotels on the islands (due to GPS not working right, streets missing name plates, etc.). It's near a main road (hence a little noisy), but not on the main road, and there is a large sign on the hotel with its name facing that road -- be on the lookout, and you will find it... eventually.When I was there, some neighborhood kids had street races going on with their vespas/scooters/motorbikes in the afternoon, and that was very noisy, but this was probably a one-off event and only lasted a couple of hours.In general, our stay was very pleasant... high overall value, nice people, and we didn't want to be near the beach and the associated all-day-long-noise from people, bars, etc.","October 8, 2012","13    Mandilaria Studios

711,"My boyfriend and me stayed in September 2011 in Mandilaria studios on Santorini and we had a great experience! The studio was nice and comfortable, with balcony and see view. When you book a studio you should specify whether you want a double or tween bad, because we first got a twin bed and then we had to change the room. Actually we changed for the better room at the same price, but in hot season it can be a problem. The family which owns tha place is very nice. The minus is that the road to the beach is not so nice, if you have a transport it is not a problem, but if you have to walk on the side of the street with the cars - this is not so great.In general, we enjoyned our staying and can recommend this place.","October 6, 2011","13    Mandilaria Studios

We were never made aware that the room was not accessible to those with walking difficulties..However, we did stay there but access to our room was very difficulty as I do have walking difficulties. Mathias, the owner, offered to give us our money back, but as it was peak season, and mid afternoon the chances of finding alternative rooms was low. We felt we had to stay.. In our opinion this is not a ""true"" hotel. There were no phones in the rooms, the bar closed at 9.00pm, there was no option to eat there except for bar snacks (which close at 9.00pm)..It would be better to describe it as a B & B .. with a snack bar. However, the rooms are lovely, the bathrooms are great, and the views are nothing less than stupendous...Mathias described the hotel to us as a quite place, but children were running around and quite noisy..

714,The hotel is by the beach and 5-10 mins walk to popular red beach. Thing i like about this hotel is the bus stop is just right in front of the hotel but it is not make crowded to the hotel. If you dont plan to rent a vehicle you would be grateful for the bus stop. The room is clean and nicely decorated. Breakfast are good. The owner (I presumed he is) is very kind and helpful. He helped explain about the island and overall question we may have. He even allowed us to check out late when there is no guests waiting for check in after us. The terrace they provide are great place to sit and read your book or even check your phone or laptop where its required internet. For me in my room has a very weak internet signal but it wont bother much as i can catch it on the terrace of my room. Overall this hotel is very nice and just for information if you take a taxi from the airport it cost us 35 euros. If not i think you can take a bus to Fira and then from Fira ask for the bus that goes to Akrotiri and it should cost you around 4 euro/ person. I m not sure about the price of the bus from airport to Fira but normal bus price is 2 euro / trip.

716,"This is the dream Greek island hotel, a haven of peace in an island that can be too popular for its own good. The Akrotiri hotel is in the south, a family run small hotel in the Cycladic style, simple and beautiful, with a lovely view of the Aegean. Sunbeds, shaded terraces, thoughtful touches like a clothes airer on the terrace, all lift it into a much higher class than the price suggests. The location is right on the sea, with lapping waves on a tiny beach below the terraces. It's in the south of the island, which is quiet - even the small southern beaches aren't crazy. The hotel is right by a run of great tavernas on the seafront, and the taxi boats to the beaches stop right there. It is also by the bus stop that will take you to anywhere else you want to go for a few euros - and on Santorini a bus is almost a luxury coach with air-con.

Would definitely stay here again..If you visit ask the owner to blow out of his conk shell!!!! hahaha","October 2, 2016","14    Akrotiri Hotel

725,"It is a gem of a place. Absolutely beautiful location with a small beach attached. The snack bar is a nice place to hang for some basic refreshments and the wifi reached as far as our room (#2). The breakfast was good, with the thickest and yummiest Greek yogurt we had on our trip.We stayed in Akrotiri to be close to the archaeological site and its a great choice. There are buses every 20 mins to Fira which takes 20 mins so a great base to see the whole Island if you are without a car. From the pier 2 mins from the hotel you can take a boat for just 5 euros.

727,It's nice hotel. Had sea view room. Best option to reach is using shuttle/taxi as Bus will take 1.5hrs from airport. Approx cost of shuttle 30 Euro for 2. Only problem with this location is it's exactly on opposite side of Oia(23km to be precise). Also hotel doesn't get you any special rate on rentals. Breakfast was OK.

Little beach at bottom - but v few people - with sunbeds / brollies, lovely clear water. Rocky / pebbly so beach shoes useful. Not posh or luxurious but clean and decent sized rooms, fab aircon. Lovely quiet little bay with several tavernas at water's edge. Good bus service to Akrotiri and Fera. Helpful friendly owner - son of man who started it.

Mathias and family were very obliging. Location was the best thing - next to Akrotiri excavation (well worth a visit) - but peaceful at night. A row of tavernas to choose from. Beaches are a good walk away - Red, White one way, Vlychada the other - the latter a longer walk + paddle along the beach but stunning scenery and a lovely (if a bit expensive and trendy) beach bar. Much nicer than staying in the hurly-burly of Oia and much better value. We would stay here again.","January 5, 2014","14    Akrotiri Hotel

733,"One of the first hotels bult on Santorini. It has great charm and interesting multi-layered architecture. We (family of 3) enjoyed very much the huge terraces which you find different places at the hotel, all with sea view, tables and sun chairs. Rooms are not huge, but adequate, well-furnished and clean.Not all of the hotel is brand new, but you feel well and welcome here. It's family-owned and people here are very friendly and helful.It has a stony beach with free sun chairs. Close to the hotel there are ferries to the wellknown red, white and black beaches. Nice, but with lots of people as everwhere on Santorini. Also close are some very good restarants with sea view. The best is Nimeli where we ate like we were in heaven.If you go to Fira (recommended for one evening to see the specatular sunset) you have to take a cab back (approx 25 Euro) since there are no buses back in the evening.PS the adjacent archeological escavations are very interesting too","December 25, 2013","14    Akrotiri Hotel

736,"The only hotel in this quiet location. The hotel owner (whose father built it) showed his consideration from the start by offering me the choice of a room with a view or easy access. He was pleasant, helpful and polite throughout, offering to let me use the room later than the standard check-out time on my last day even without being asked - a very rare courtesy from hoteliers.The room was well equipped and everything worked. The fridge was particularly handy.Nothing disturbed my night's sleep other than the unaccustomed sound of waves on the rocky beach - not ideal for a pre-breakfast swim but serviceable, and in any case several sandier beaches are within a short walk. The breakfast buffet was good and on time, not always the case in Greece.The café has only a limited range, but there are several restaurants along the shore by the hotel and more options in Akrotiri village, a pleasant stroll away. I found the café handy for a beer at sunset by the sea.The Minoan ruins are close by, so it's easy to make an early start before the tourist buses pour in. I shared the ruined town with only three or four other visitors.","October 19, 2012","14    Akrotiri Hotel

The owners of the hotel are really nice guys, always polite, happy and ready to help you in any case. They are the nicest people I've ever seen. All the rooms are very clean and pretty, there is an air conditioner and a TV set in each room. The area where the hotel is situated are not crowded with tourists and that fact is really great. There are a lot of greek taverns on the beach near the hotel, where you can eat the freashest fish and the traditional greek cousine, one of these taverns, ""The caves of Nicolaos"" was awarded like the best tavern on Santorini. From the beach near the hotel you can go to Red Beach ( wich is very nice), White Beach and Black Beach ( with the beautiful black voulcanic sand) by boat for 5 euros. Near this hotel is situated ""The Prehistoric town of Akrotiri"", the museum, the ancient city.

741,"Strongly recommend this hotel which we chose with great care, even checking on google earth. Directly off the beach, lovely pool, spotless room and public areas, very full breakfast options included all at a very good rate - any number of hot and cold quality items. We were spoiled for choice around the hotel as Kamari is a very upmarket resort with plenty of dining options and a great base to do Fira and Oia for the sensational caldera views and sunset but also great to visit Perissa, Ancient Thera, Akrotiri and more. We hired a car, absolutely hassle-free, and easily drove everywhere and parked, using our own sat nav. I think bus tours would also be easy. Arion Bay is at the quieter end of the beach, and they offer free sunbeds and towels inside or across on their beach - but be aware the island airport is nearby. This really did not bother us at all. I think Kamari is the best beach area on Santorini.","May 15, 2019","15    Arion Bay

743,"We so enjoyed our week at Arion bay. We had a superior sea view room. The room was a good size and had everything we needed. Simply decorated and spotlessly clean. Our door opened on to a small area to sit outside with table and chairs then the pool. Pool, loungers, bar area, breakfast room were all spotlessly clean. Cocktail prices were really reasonable 6.50 Euro. I would also recommend lunch here if you are staying. Fairly basic offering, sandwiches, salads, pizzas etc but reasonable prices and saves having a heavy meal elsewhere. The girls who clean and make breakfasts and lunches are lovely people and really friendly. Elias and Marius on the bar are lovely too. Everybody here was so friendly and helpful. Breakfast was good. Continental selection as well as eggs bacon and sausage. Help yourself service in a relaxed space. Location is fantastic at the quieter end of the prom. Lots of good restaurants and shops in walking distance. Our favourite restaurant was Alismira a 5 minute walk for dinner. We took a taxi to Imerovigli and walked up Fira which made for a great day. We also had a day out on an island tour with nostos travel. We would recommend the tour as very good value for money (approximately 40 Euro booked through trip advisor). The group was large and there were some issues with seating on the coach but so much cheaper than other tours available and we would not have been able to pack so much in to one day ourselves. One comment, it may be worth having an information card in each room with the WiFi password and a copy of the lunch menu as we did not realise food was available other than breakfast until day 6 and had not seen anybody else eating either. All in all Arion Bay offered amazing value for money. We would definitely like to come back to stay again. ","May 16, 2018","15    Arion Bay

This hotel was a ""dark horse"" for us, it was an additional option provided by our touristic agency because we weren't received the reservation approval from another hotel. And the Arion Bay was a correct choice - located on the Black beach in Kamari, customer-friendly stuff, clean room, Wi-Fi which working not only in the hotel, but on the beach too.

746,"My friends and I visited this hotel again in May 17, we had also been in May 15 and thought it was brilliant. Our second visit was as good as the first time. We were all in the annexe part of the hotel at the Side of Kings Restaurant, it has a small pool at the front, where we had 2 rooms and it also has a jacuzzi pool at the back and further sunbeds and chairs etc and its very quiet. The rooms are specious, exceptionally clean and modern, they have a fridge, air con and a large mirror and well lit (essential for mature ladies getting ready at night!). The beds are comfortable with nice bedding. Everyone who stays there are friendly and of course Elias talks to all of his guest, he is genuinely concerned that his guests enjoy their holiday and always happy to help. We were planning a small surprise party for one of our group and he organised a local bakery to bake and deliver a cake for us, whch was absolutely delicious. There are a number of great restaurants near the hotel if you go left out of the entrance, there are many more if you go right but we found the ones to the left of a better quality for the same prices. The beach is directly in front of the hotel so you can hear the waves lapping as you sit on your balcony (if you have a sea view room). The breakfast is simple but tasty and ranges from Cereals, Fruit, Yoghurts to eggs and bacon etc.The only downside is that The Kings Restaurant next door play their music quite loud during the day (ear plugs!) but you can use their comfortable sunbeds on the beach if you buy a drink from them.I have recommended this hotel to family who are going later this year, I'm sure they will love it.Elias was waiting for some sunbeds to arrive to have on the beach but they had not turned up before we left, will just have to go back and try them out!","July 11, 2017","15    Arion Bay

749,"As a last minute booking this was the only available hotel (5/7 – 12/7) and we were absolutely delighted with the result. The Manager, Elia, is an excellent host and is a font of information with regards to restaurants, bars etc – he will also organise booking restaurant tables and taxis too. The hotel is as good as on the beach and breakfast is taken by the pool in view of the breaking waves. Our room was basic (sea view with balcony) but kept spotlessly clean and the air conditioning was quietly efficient. The majority of guests seemed to be returnees, some for as many as the past 15 years, which speaks volumes for Elia and his team. Of an evening, the pool bar has quite a buzz about it and cocktails and shots are distributed with ease and charm.

Two of the rooms were unrefurbished and basic but they were fine and of a standard we expected in Greece. The other 3 rooms were refurbished, very modern, brilliant showers and bathrooms but could do with a bit more bedside storage. The hotel is in a brilliant spot on the sea front with lots of nice restaurants nearby. The thing that makes this hotel stand out from the crowd are the staff, they are all fabulous and will go beyond the extra mile to ensure you have a wonderful holiday. The owner, Elias speaks to all of the guests to make sure they are happy and one night when one of our party had a bad back rang his cousin and he gave her a lift to the restarant even though it wasn't very far away. We never usually go back to the same place twice but we are going to go back the Arion Bay next year. Kamari is near the airport so you do get planes flying overhead but not too many and we didn't hear any during the night. Next year we will pay extra for the refurbished rooms for all of us as they are much nicer and seem to have better sound proofing, the walls were paper thin in the basic rooms, thankfully our neighbours were mature with no children!! I would recommend ear plugs to anyone in the basic rooms. Breakfast was more than adequate with cereals, bread , jam meat, cheese, sausage slices, bacon eggs etc and a choice of teas, coffee and fruit juices. Possibly the only thing missing was a toaster! Otherwise it was perfect.","May 25, 2015","15    Arion Bay

760,"Our travel agent booked this hotel and was not one her usual choices. She wanted to find something in Fira but every property she generally used was booked. We visited Fira (very convenient by public bus), and were very happy that we were at Arion Bay on the beach! The weather was very warm and so after sight seeing, it was perfect to be able to float in the beautiful blue water and take a dip in the hotel pool. Because the hotel is located near public transportation, we were able to see Fira and IA easily. We walked to the Koutsoyanopoulos Winery and took the nearby ""fun train"" to Ancient Thira. Also, as everyone mentions, Elias was a wonderful host. He is a very friendly, helpful manager. And although he is very busy at the bar, he always takes the time to answer any and all questions and chat ( he speaks several languages fluently).The room was small but spotlessly clean. There was a folding dryer on the patio so we were able to wash and dry our clothes conveniently. And the buffet breakfast was always fresh and delicious. We feel lucky that we ended up at Arion Bay!","September 14, 2014","15    Arion Bay

The hotel team inc Nicos were fantastic and brought me an iron from home on my wedding day. If you want to chill out during the day with fantastic beach views or by the pool then this is a great place. Great Value. Breakfast is fresh, Many of the rooms have been refurbished or new and a new outdoor whirl pool was opened in the week we stayed. Top Tip if you do book here ask Elias to advise you on the best way to explore Santorini. We hired a car for 3 days and toured with his map.

Ellias, a really kind person, tried to make up my discontentment offering me what I think is one of the best rooms in hotel, in the old building. All white, recently renewed, with funny furniture built in concrete (I think) and painted in white, large, with sea view, a nice balcony with bougainvillea flowers, it was absolutely adorable. The bathroom was correct, plenty of hot water, very comfortable.

Our room was nice with a great view of the beautiful garden. The only thing we didn't like about the room was the bathroom. It was OK, but the shower was really small, and the mugs you use to put to toothbrush in was quite dirty. The breakfast was really good! It was a big breakfast with eggs, fruits, greek yoghurt, cheese, salami and much more!The cleaning ladies at the hotel were very nice as well.

Nothing was of any trouble for him. Such a nice guy and outspoken. Every evening we made it a point to be at the bar, and thats were we met so many nice people. Shots were Elias specialities, and made it a point that for every drink we offered him, as well as with the bill, he offered different shooters. The rooms have no tv, but that is a good thing, coz likethat, we had the opportunity to socialize more with everyone. Wifi is free and reachable from everywhere.

We have been told that Arion bay was the luxurious 3 star hotel in Kamari and It turned out to be quite true. It´s right on a beach, very nicely situated. With large pool, sunbeds, pool bar of course and wifi all over the area. The rooms aren´t perfect but they are more than satisfying for the time of your stay. The housekeeping was also decent, new towels every day, cleaning, moping the floor, anything you need and you dont have to ask for it. The owner - Elijah - is very nice, friendly and helpful, he speaks fluent English and German. What we really loved was breakfast. Anything you can think of. Bacon, eggs, sausages, cereals, fruit and vegetable salads, sweets etc. The hotel is for everyone. We were just two but there were also families with little kids (cca from 6 months and older) and it is very comfortable for older people as well.

It's like when you leave part of you stays. The staff, Elias is the best bartender on the island, really makes this place much more then a place to eat and sleep. BTW, there buffet is really great as are the rooms and the location. As one person commented of hanging at Elias's bar, ""He Could Make A Party Out Of A Empty Room"". Not to say it's a wild place, old and young blend in nicely, it's just a pleasent group that enjoys meeting and having a good time.

Stay at Stelios Place if these things are important to you:- Excellent price (50 Eur per night for our ""honeymoon suite"" room - newly updated, A/C, comfortable bed and pillows, safe, refrigerator, clothesline, patio with bistro set)- A place with a pool (gorgeous pool & chairs/umbrellas/poolside patio cafe)- Amazing hospitality (Stelios, his wife, and his two daughters, plus Milo the dog, make your stay feel like it's with family)- Location (A 2 minute walk from Perissa beach & the Perissa-Perivolos beach road)- Food available at the hotel (breakfast, drinks including small bar, and light lunch fare available for purchase)- Nearby conveniences (ATMs, bus stop to Fira and other villages/sights, smoothie shop - Tutti Frutti, vehicle rentals, small market shop around the corner with water, sunscreen, some food items, etc)- Free pickup & drop-off at airport/port by Stelios himself, even at 11pm..If you want something ""luxury,"" this is not the place for you (though I daresay in terms of comfort, cleanliness, and design of the updated rooms, it should have more stars). There is no spa, no big hotel restaurant, no gym. But, you will feel like you are part of the culture of the island - not at another Hilton plopped in the middle of anywhere. If you want to save the bulk of your traveling money for seeing the sights, taking wine tours, spending half a day sailing around the island on a catamaran, enjoying local fare, and perhaps island hopping a day or two - this IS the place to stay. (We spent more at our hotel in Crete for one night than we did for EIGHT days at Stelios!! And guess what - I enjoyed Stelios more!)If you need further convincing, read the other reviews.

Stelios welcomed us at the airport and also took us back for our return flight. Rooms are modern, comfortable and cleaned each day. We had a lovely balcony from which you could see the sea.The pool is a beautiful area with sunloungers, comfy seats or tables and chairs to choose from depending what you prefer.The communal kitchen was very handy for us to help cater for our daughter plus each room has a fridge.The travel cot provided was spotless and felt like our own. It was a joy to see everyone each morning. Stelios and his family made us feel so welcome, were happy to offer advise and helped with anything needed. The location was perfect for us... one street back from the beach front with all the restaurants etc or turn the opposite direction out of the accommodation and you quickly reach the main road where there are more restaurants, shops and the bus stops. Very easy for walks with the pram.We hope to return to Santorini and would not look to stay anywhere else but here.","June 5, 2019","16    Stelios Place

The rooms were lovely....as new in fact.. and everything was beautifully clean. Stelios, his wife and his daughter are really lovely, friendly people and made us feel so welcome. The pool is also fantastic. The hotel is literally 60 metres from the beach and could not be in a better location !......All in all we thoroughly enjoyed our stay here and I highly recommend this hotel .","May 29, 2019","16    Stelios Place

Not only was Stelios place a great place to stay but Stelios himself was just a super star helping us arrange all sorts of things from suggesting a florist and some musicians to sorting a coach to take the guests to the wedding. Being a real local he knew everyone even a contact to help a mate who drunkenly fell off a balcony and broke his ankle.Basically love him and his place.

798,"Nothing less than 5 stars is deserved for the quality of service I recieved here. On check-in I met Katalina she is very sweet and welcoming. She, her mother and father runs the hotel. The room was nice, pleasant and clean, with a quaint patio. The location is a short 2min walk from the beach, but removed enough to feel very peaceful and relaxing. Though I didn't spend much time at the pool, the pool area is very cute and nicely done. I initially only planned to stay one night but felt so relaxed and at home here that I extended my stay for a second night.I ate breakfast here each morning of bacon eggs toasts and juice made well and tasted good and afterwards her father serves a slice a yummy breakfast cake that is made by her mother.But the highlight for me was when her father offered me a ride to the port to catch the ferry. That goes above and beyond the expectations for service!! I enjoyed my stay here would reccomend this place to anyone! And if I ever return to Perissa I would choose to stay here again.Thank you all so much for a wonderful stay.","October 13, 2018","16    Stelios Place

Our room overlooked the pool which had wonderful padded sunbeds and beanbags-luxury! The staff are friendly and helpful. Breakfast was delicious served in the restaurant by the pool. Our room was comfortable and clean. It's a 2 minute walk to the beach which is pretty. The sea was warm in August and lovely and clear. There are lots of nice restaurants along the seafront.Oia was about an hours drive to see the sunset which was incredible, or get a bus from the main street.

Immediate good start as we arrived fairly late at night and we got picked up from the airport which was easy and only 20 mins to the hotel. Hotel is in a brilliant location literally 2 minutes walk to the beach and main Street with tons of restaurants, bars and shops. Even though you are so close to this, the hotel was so peaceful and quiet as it’s slightly tucked away you can relax and sleep well at night. The room was fantastic, lovely balcony, plenty of space and storage, everything you need/want. Pool is lovely, plenty of comfy Sunloungers with umbrellas. Breakfast was always lovely, my favourite was Greek yoghurt, honey, muesli & fresh fruit! Everyone at the hotel was so friendly and so helpful which was lovely, also recommend and booked us onto an amazing sunset boat trip which was incredible and well worth it, Katerina also booked us a fantastic table in Thira with stunning views & great food. They were all so helpful with recommendations of places to eat and visit which is great as it was our first time in Santorini. Couldn’t have asked for a better week.

A 3-minute walk from the beach and the waterfront restaurants, snack bars and shops; a 3-minute walk to the bus stop that takes you to several interesting towns in Santorini (Fira, Ia, just to name a few); a short distance from grocery and convenience stores; a 10-minute walk to an interesting hiking trail up a hill where the archeological site of the ancient city of Thira is located. Simply ideal for those who prefer not to rent a car. My only complaint is that my room was very close to the garage and reception; as a light sleeper, I often heard noise through the walls and floor.

821,"We (a couple) booked this place nearly blindly after seeing the fantastic reviews. It lived up to the expectations.The family who runs this place is really amazing. First, Stelios himself comes to pick you up from the airport (message them in advance so he knows your time). He told us he made up to six airport trips in one day while we were there! His daughter Katarina is the sweetest person. I had a really bad cold while there and she made sure I got the right medicine from the pharmacy and kept checking up on me. They also have a cute dog named Milo who hangs out by the pool.The hotel itself is only a 2 minute walk from the beach (it appears further on maps and is listed as a 15-minute walk on competitor websites, but this is false). There are plenty of great restaurants nearby and unlike the other side of the island, Perissa never feels swamped by tour groups and you really get the laidback beach experience. It is, in our opinion, a much better place to stay than Oia or Thira. There are easy buses that can take you over to that side for a day trip. The rooms are simple but very, very clean, and what else do you really need at the beach? Simply put, for the price you get a 5-star experience. We wish we lived in Europe so we could come back here every year. It was that great.","November 1, 2017","16    Stelios Place

No need to take beach towels as they are provided to. The Cleanliness was top class. Only one small thing the shower was very small and the plastic curtain easily touched your skin.

826,"Ok, so this was our 4th time in Perissa, 1st time staying at Stelios Place and I can honestly say I would not stay anywhere else. It's not that any of the previous hotels have been disappointing it's just the fact that as a family business, Stelios, Ava and Katerina go the extra mile. The hotel itself is fantastic with a stunning poolside area with more than enough tables, umbrellas and sun loungers. There are 22 rooms, we stayed in number 20 which was spacious, spotlessly clean with a lovely balcony overlooking the pool. Housekeeping visit daily to change towels, empty bins, clean floors etc. I know what you're thinking "" I wouldn't expect any less "" so on to the extra mile. . . . . . . Stelios personally collects you from the airport/port and also provides a return transfer on your departure date at not extra cost. Also included in the room rate is air conditioning and access to the safe located in the room. The bathroom is spacious, as is the shower which has a constant supply of hot water whatever the time of day. Katerina has a wealth of knowledge and is more than happy to recommend places to go and will also arrange excursions if required. Breakfast is optional and not included in the room rate but is well priced and cooked to order. It's worth noting that Ava cooks an excellent fried egg with a runny yoke. We booked a quad bike at Motomania and when asked where we were staying we got a €10 per day discount. They also have a stunning private villa available for rent with amazing views, please do check their website and book direct as the prices are very competitive, it's also worth paying cash in euros on arrival if you can . Finally I would like to thank everyone at Stelios place for a fantastic 7 night stay and John and I look forward to seeing you all again in 2018. Oh and give Milo (jack russel) a belly tickle from both of us. ","October 4, 2017","16    Stelios Place

827,"I've stayed in Perissa several times over the years, and I can honestly say that Stelios Place was the nicest hotel I've been to in the area. It's about a minutes walk to the beach, where you can find lots of restaurants and bars. Well-priced (especially compared to hotels on the other side of the island), immaculately cleaned with a great family atmosphere courtesy of Katerina, Stelios and family. We were greeted by Stelios at the airport and taken to Perissa free of charge. Our triple room was massive with a private balcony and air conditioning, with a large bathroom and wardrobe space. The room was cleaned every day and we were given fresh towels. They also have luggage storage for the day you leave and showers if you want to get cleaned up after checking out. We only stayed for a week, but wish it could have been longer!!","September 18, 2017","16    Stelios Place

830,Our room was spotless.We had a small balcony that even had a small clothesline!Small table and chairs- great to sit and very private.Beds ok not the most comfortable but it might be old age :)Everything looked new and bright. Nice room.Provided towels for the beach. I used one as a floor mat to soak up the water from the shower going everywhere. Worked a treat! Kept the floor clean and dry.And it dried super fast on the balcony.Beach is 10 steps away. Convenience shop with all you need is also 10 steps away on the main road.For the price we paid this place delivered big time!!Its basic but if you are on a budget i can highly recommend!,"September 14, 2017","16    Stelios Place

Stellios kindly collected us from the airport and pointed out various views and things to do along the way to the hotel- perhaps a 15 min drive.Upon arriving you're warmly greeted by Kat who was so lovely and eager to take us straight to our rooms - no need for a formal check in.

Stelios family is also very friendly : always a friendly word with a smile (nowadays it is not so common). And for sure the best money value for Santorini island.

Nothing is too much trouble from the second Stelios collected myself, my husband and our 5 children from the airport.The rooms are immaculate and cleaned from top to toe each day. The family serve wonderful meals throughout the day that are very well priced and extremely generous in size. Katerina can advise you on the best places to visit and can arrange everything for you, on Sunday we spent the most amazing day sailing around the island on a catamaran.Whilst on holiday our son had a slight ear infection, the family advised us on all local doctors available, booked us an appointment and then Stelios drove us there- this demonstrates just how special Stelios Place is.On Sunday our youngest son celebrated his birthday - he was overjoyed to receive a birthday cake from the hotel and be greeted by balloons at the breakfast table!The pool area is so relaxing with plenty of sun beds and parasols to enjoy . Stelios has a communal kitchen that is available to you if you want to prepare your own snacks and on the last day of your holiday you can store your luggage in large luggage lockers and shower in bathrooms provided before leaving.If you want to go somewhere truly special and meet the most wonderful family in the world then stay at Stelios Place and you will not be disappointed.","August 23, 2017","16    Stelios Place

The bed was very comfortable and air conditioning included without restrictions.❄The window shutters are perfect to black out light from the room to help baby sleep. There is even a bath tub which we have never seen in any self catering places in Greece. It is also unusual to have a daily housekeeping service in Greece. (Normally every other day ot less) The housekeeping staff were very flexible during baby nap times, thank you!

The hosts were very helpful, especially as I wanted to book a sunset caldera trip for my husband's birthday. They made it so easy - thank you. We only used the main bedroom and the bed was very comfy and the air con great. The swimming pool was lovely but we were busy on a short break so only got to use it once. The apartment is within walking distance to the beach and shops. Plenty of space to park a hire car and very close to the supermarket. We walked up to ancient thira twice, but a quick note, don't take the path signposted. Walk a little further and on the right hand side you will see another path that starts with a lot of loose pumice. If you follow that one, it leads to a much easier way up and cuts off about 20 mins of the journey. It took us 25 mins going up this way. Also, go early in the morning before the sun gets to that side.The only gripe we had was that when we left the apartment, the electric would go off so we could not charge any cameras/phones/etc during the day. The cooker rings were not very good and really hard to use and I ended up getting burned. A microwave and toaster would be better.Everything else was perfect!","September 22, 2016","17    Aretousa Villas

863,"Stayed for just under a week at Aretousa villas and really enjoyed our stay. We were picked up from the airport as we were staying over 3 nights (added bonus!) and taken straight to the villas. We had the apartment with the mountain view and couldn't fault it; it was clean, spacious and had plenty of room. There are plenty of restaurants around the corner, a mini market as well as a 24 hour bakery that is very handy. Perissa beach is only a few minutes walk away and there are plenty of moto rental places to choose from (if you don't want to take the bus you'll need some sort of transport to watch the sunset from the caldera). The family that run the villas are so friendly and accommodating, it almost felt like home! ","August 11, 2016","17    Aretousa Villas

864,"We booked our flight with Easyjet and Aretousa through Booking.com. Part of the booking involved free collection from the airport. Despite being almost 3 hours late in arriving Debbie's dad met us with a smile. He then apologised as he had to wait for the Athens flight to arrive in 20 mins as more guests were arriving and there was not enough time to take us to Perissa and come back. On the drive over to Aretousa he gave us information on the island and ideas of things to do and see. On arrival we were met by his wife who immediately showed us to our studio with the formal check in being left till the next day. They had also kindly put a large bottle of water in the fridge for our late arrival. There is a 24 hour bakery minutes away should you arrive late. The aircon and safety deposit is supplied free (for those who travel to the Greek Islands with package companies this is often a chargeable extra). Our studio was a good size and nicely furnished. The lighting was very good - with bedside lights, a strip of lights above the dressing table and good lighting in bathroom in additional to normal lighting. A recurring theme in all my reviews is I don't travel light and it would have been handy to have more drawers or shelves to put things away. As it was my shoes were just laid out in a row beside my bed. Also a shelf or counter top in bathroom would have been handy. As is typical in Greece the shower consisted of a shower tray and curtain. The shower curtain does try to cling to you a bit but the bathroom will get very wet if you don't use it. It was very clean and there was always hot water although the temperature fluctuated while you use it. Our window in the bathroom opened onto stairs so we could only open it when we weren't using it. The kitchenette is very small although there is a kettle - there was a reasonable collection of pans, chopping board, bowl, bread knife etc so although we only used it for a cold breakfast and keeping water cold you could prepare a meal. I would suggest using Carrefour, Big Coop or even Lidl out near Thira as most of the mini markets didn't really cater for cooking proper meals. I loved the blue shutters on the balcony doors which opened onto a good sized covered balcony which proved invaluable with the winds. We were in room 8 and overlooking the car park and other buildings so while not an amazing view we were not overlooked. There was sometimes a lot of noise from other guests moving furniture about, clattering up stairs and banging doors etc in the night. That said we loved staying there everyday when we saw the family they would greet you with a smile and a friendly greeting - greek if you were willing to try. Debbie organised the car hire at a very good price - no point in going for a big car roads are narrow and buses squeeze past regardless and she also organised our Caldera Boat Trip for us which again was good value. At various points we were given tomatoes and prickly pears from her dad's garden in passing and then on our last day we were given a glass of Vinsanto. Very good value for money and just thinking of the family whilst I write this review is making me smile. ","August 4, 2016","17    Aretousa Villas

The rooms are airy and spacious with fantastic balconies and the proprietors are welcoming, warm and really helpful.

Both rooms where very clean, actually cleaning was done on a daily basis. Despina gave us a lot of useful tips, tried to find an answer to all our questions.

This is a family run establishment which is close to a 24hr bakery, supermarket, restaurants and beach but in a quiet area.

868,"Me and my girlfriend had our last dinner in Greece at Tranquilo Bar in Perissa and was really pleased by the experience. The food was really good. We had the fried rice and the Caesar wrap and the service was also good. The best thing was the price and the seating area. The prices was the lowest in Perissa, a big meal for just 5€. The seating area was so cosy and really different to the other places at the beach. I would gladly recommend this place and come back.Me and my girlfriend stayed at Aretousa Villas in Perissa for five nights during our stay in July and have mostly positive feeling about the hotel. The price is really the best thing and you really need to have this in mind as the place was very cheap and much bang for the buck. When we arrived the host Debbie went through a too long check in process when she mostly talked about what we should or ""must"" do on Santorini and presented many boat tours and noted that we didn't call when our ferry was late which stressed us. She should have focused more on the room details. This also happened when we booked our sailing tour. She was very determined and wanted to really get involved in every part in the planning. We are quite young but would have appreciated more room for own thoughts. But this was also good sometimes during our stay when we felt taken care of. The dad that managed the free transfers was very cute and polite.We stayed in the budget room in the basement. The room was simple but very clean. On the booking it stood that the room had view which is really weird because it was the least of a view we had during our whole stay in Greece. The kitchen was equipped with a quite small amount of kitchenware. Just two of everything and not a big knife. The pool was very good and the location in Perissa excellent. The only thing that was far away was a real supermarket as the nearby market was very small.But for about 35€ per night this place is really good and I would really recommend it to budget travelers.

869,My partner and I stayed 3 nights in this family run hotel. Its location is not in the crowded and busy part of the island so we could enjoy of the quietness of a small town. Very close to Perissa beach (3 min walking) and to very nice restaurants (2 min walking).Despina welcomed us and helped us on planning our visit to the Island. She recommend us few restaurants and a gorgeous bakery as well. Renting a moppet we could visit most of the best parts of Santorini. Our en-suit room was in the first floor of the main building. It had a small balcony with views to the mountain and a small kitchen with all the essential. Very clean.We truly recommend this marvelous place for its quiet location and the friendly hospitality of all the family. We definitely would go back.,"July 2, 2016","17    Aretousa Villas

870,"This B&B was exactly as we expected.We have done all the large All Inclusive hotels and wanted to give something to smaller businesses and to the Greek economy, rather than be in a massive hotel fighting for sunbeds.This place was the opposite, we had the small pool to ourselves for most of the 14 days we stayed there.We hired quads for touring the island and it was lovely scenery and some interesting places to visit.Debbie is the owners daughter and does all the checking in and spends time telling you all about the island and what it has to offer.Debbie's mother even gave us homemade wine and savouries, on a few occasions, while we were by the pool. what a lovely gesture.Perissa itself is a small little place, with the main road housing bars and restaurants, but we preferred the beach front area, that has a better selection of bars & restaurants.The main road is also pretty narrow and it unnerved my wife every time we had to walk down, so beware if you go there with children.The island itself is gorgeous and Perissa is a great base in which to go and explore the rest of the island.We ate in a lot of different restaurants, that in the main were great, which we will cover in separate reviews and our favourite was Scirroco, great pasta dishes, steak and pizza.Aretousa Villas even supply free wi-fi, safety deposit box and air con, there are noy many hotels/B&B's who provide all that for free in Greece.The rooms are nice and bright and the apartment we had even had flat screen TV's in the living area and in the bedroom.There is a small supermarket within a minutes's walk and it is not much further to high street or the beach.The rooms were cleaned every day and the towlels changed every day.If it's a relaxing holiday you need, in a small family run B&B, close to all amenities, then give it a try.If you want an hotel with hundreds of people and loads of on site facilities, then this is not the place for you, but if you want warm friendly owners, peace & quiet and charm, then you will love this place.Thank you Debbie, George and your lovely wife, for a great holiday.","July 2, 2016","17    Aretousa Villas

891,"Just back from a wonderful week here and couldn't recommend it more highly. I looked at staying in Fira or Perissa and made the right choice for us. I looked at several places to stay but preferred to have a place with a pool and without a bar so it wasn't noisy at night. They only had a ground floor mountain view apartment available and we were hesitant as prefer to be high up. Anyway, needn't have worried, the apartment was newly refurbished, spacious, immaculately clean (clean towels every day and regular bedding changes) and although the shower room was small, it had an enclosed shower cubicle which prevented the whole bathroom being flooded as can often happen in Greece! The patio just outside the bedroom gave lovely views of the little church up the mountain and the area was very quiet but in a perfect position for all you needed. 1 minute walk to a mini market, 3-4 to a 24 hour bakery and 5 mins from the beach and all the best bars/restaurants. The family were lovely, local to Santorini and very friendly but left you in peace and the dad was waiting at the airport for us on arrival and took us back at a time to suit us. We were given a drink of their wine that they make and a bottle of Santo's wine was left in our room as a present when we returned after a day out. The pool is small but perfectly suitable for swimming and plenty of sunbeds. Wifi signal really strong from our room (not that it bothers me but I know it's important for some). we had a late flight but could leave our luggage and valuables could be left in their house. They also had a loo and shower room we could use and provided towels. I'd love to return to Perissa some day, we had an amazing holiday and would stay here again without a doubt.

893,"This place was wonderful. The owners are the salt of the earth. The mother, Areti, and father, Jiorgio, and daughter, Thespina, were the best. They bent over backwards to make my stay pleasant and my two days here were the most memorable of my 10 days in Greece. The rooms were clean, the location was perfect (away from all the tourists, yet 200 yards from the black sand beach) and the rooms rates were a bargain. I highly recommend this place.

We loved the relaxed feel about the place - nothing was a hassle. We would definitely recommend contacting Sammi directly to arrange your stay as he helped us to arrange travel arrangements for several of the days activities.

897,"I honestly can write more than 200 words here. My husband and I had a blast in Santorini staying at this villa hosted by Sammy&his wife and Safa. The location, hospitality, and service was great! Miss the place, people and their kindness. I will definitely reserve this place again when I go back to Santorini. Here is what you need to know;Location: is perfect bc it’s minutes away from Oia center by walk. I saw some people complained about the hassle finding this place or walking to it, but let me tell you, get ready to experience the same all over this city. You are going to an ancient/historical place, not walking in Paris, so plz don’t complain about the road. This is basically the structure of the entire Island. Service: This place is so cozy and clean. I work at a biotech company, and I have OCD more than I need to, but I was very comfortable sleeping here because it was very clean.Hospitality: Sammy is great. He is fluent in English, Arabic, French, Greek and god knows what else :) finding places is hard in Santorini. Sammy was very approachable and helpful to help us out to visit the greatest areas. What you need to take with you: Pay for internet to use GPS, international electric plugs, hat for summer, and of course a lot of euros Thank you so much Sammy.

899,"My trip to Greece was somewhat last minute since I was going in the high season. When I booked Ambelia, I was a little disappointed that I wouldn't be in the heart of Oia. However, after I arrived, I couldn't have been happier with the location. Santorini in general is a tourist island. It's beautiful, but in the high season, overrun with tourists. Finikia and Ambelia are blessfully positioned a little off the beaten path so it's quiet and peaceful. Finikia is the closest I came to seeing a traditional Grecian island village. It took me about 15 minutes to walk to Oia at a stroll. Several more minutes to walk to the end of Oia where people watch the sunset from. There is a sidewalk most of the way. The property is built into a hillside in the cave style. You cannot drive right up to the property so resort hounds that can't manage their own luggage should make other arrangements. In fact, you can't drive into the village at all. From the main parking lot, signs point you to the property if you're paying attention.The staff was fantastic and helpful without being pushy. Always said hello and goodbye. Asked if I needed anything, etc. The pool area was lovely and a good spot to watch the sunset (without 600 other people clambering over you like in Oia). The rooms were quite large and cool. You have your own terrace area (again, good for the sunset). I slept so well because if you close the shutters, no light gets in. A little too quiet for a New Yorker though so I had to turn on a fan for noise. These types of places can get a little musty when they are shut up so make sure to open the windows when you leave and it's fine. Wifi in the room was good. Cell service was not as it's basically a cave. Just have to step outside to make a call though.Ambelia is also right down the path from Krinaki Taverna which was my favorite dining experience in all of Greece. Overall, a really nice, relaxing stay in a real island village.","July 6, 2018","18    Ambelia Traditional Villas

901,We were recommended this place by someone. It turned out to be an excellent choice. For the sake of a 15 minute walk into the centre of Oia it represented great value for money. To stay in the Oia itself can cost a small fortune. The bed was very comfortable. The rooms were quite basic but in a funny kind of way we quite liked it. The WiFi signal is very weak or non existent. If you need WiFi you need to go to the reception area. Sami advertises satellite? I don't quite know what he means by this. There was no TV in the room and the radio didn't work. Anyway these were only minor irritations. The place was very spacious. Hot water etc was fine. Overall we liked this place. It's main draw for us was the position very close to Oia at an affordable cost. The owner Sami was very helpful and friendly. The breakfast was basic but OK. We would recommend this place. There is also a bar/restaurant close by for a last beer on the way back at night. Thanks again Sami and also to the fella who recommended this place. Very pleased overall.

902,"Great location – a 15-minute walk from Oia in a pedestrian-only part of town, with the ocean almost always in view. You really don’t feel like you’re staying as close to major tourist attractions as you are. The rooms are simple and clean; you really feel like you could be staying in one of the local homes. You have a view of the ocean; Oia is in walking-distance; and Fira is no more than a 20-minute drive. Sammy is a fun guy with a great sense of humor. He was always available for anything big or small, from making breakfast, to helping us arrange excursions, to simply getting us a taxi to the airport on our way home. If you stay here, you absolutely must go to the only restaurant in town, Krinaki, featured on Andrew Zimmern’s show. Anything with lamb in it is delicious, and the view is beautiful – day or night.","April 1, 2018","18    Ambelia Traditional Villas

903,Had a wonderful time at ambelia traditional villas in Finikia. Its just about a 10 or maximum 12 min walk to central Oia. The owner Sam was one of the friendliest people i met on my trip to greece. He helped us with everything we needed and also dropped us to the airport in his own car. The room was very nice and cozy and we loved the view. Complete unobstructed sea view. We just sat in the courtyard of the room with a bottle of wine on both the afternoons we stayed here. The place was so quiet and relaxing we dint wanna leave. The breakfast too was pretty good and the homemade strawberry jam was delicious. I have only dropped 1 star from an otherwise 5 star rating is because the day we reached here we had to walk with our heavy bags on quite a flight of stairs to get to this place which was the biggest drawback. But when we checked out sam made sure he had somebody to help with our luggage. I have absolutely no complaints at all and would recommend everyone to stay here with no worries at all.,"October 14, 2017","18    Ambelia Traditional Villas

I liked this hotel because it was away from the touristy Oia downtown so we would avoid the traffic but you could walk into Oia within 15 minutes. I would definitely recommend this hotel if you want to enjoy Oia but you want to stay away from the crowds, get more hotel space and be surrounded by locals. Sammy the manager and his family made us feel welcome and they were very helpful. There is a bit of a walk to get to the hotel from the road but we enjoyed the scenery and the quaint path.","July 29, 2017","18    Ambelia Traditional Villas

906,"Thoroughly enjoyed our 3 night stay in a 2 bedroomed apartment at Ambelia.Sammy arranged our pick up at the airport which meant we did not have to find our way through the narrow cobbled streets late at night. We loved everything about our stay. Location: in the small village of Finikia which has a few bars and restaurants yet only a 5-10 minute mostly flat walk into the centre of Oia. Quiet and outside the hustle, bustle and traffic of Oia. Position on the hillside overlooking the bay made for fabulous views. Taxi can only get as close as the car park then you have to walk down the narrow streets (traffic-free). We were helped with our luggage at arrival and departure so this was no problem.Apartment:Large, spacious, freshly decorated, well-equipped and with very comfortable beds. There is even a cafetiere for fresh coffee. Built into the hillside so the bedrooms and bathrooms are within the cave which was quite unique. Plenty of hot water and good shower power. Towels and sheets were clean, fresh and good quality. Big front terrace with table and chairs with fantastic views out to sea. Only issue was that bedrooms had interior windows without curtains so lacked a bit of privacy for 2 couples sharing. We hung towels over then which was fine. Facilities: Lovely pool, lots of space to lie around pool but also covered areas. Breakfast served in covered areas beside pool. Reasonable choice of breads , cereal and even a toaster! Delicious greek yogurt and home made jams. Omelettes available made to order for no extra charge.Would stay again without hesitation due to uniqueness of accommodation and hospitality of Sammy,","July 13, 2017","18    Ambelia Traditional Villas

Breakfast was decent too!Sami the manager was brilliant, very accommodating and would answer anything you needed, even found us a place to watch the United game in town!

If you want this then I can recommend Ambelia. First impressions was not overwhelming, but settle in and the quite tones of nothing hits you fast. In fact the birds become the noisiest thing there. It was so pleasant and ideal to chill. Local restaurants are great and costs less than those in commercial / tourist locations. Your well earned Buck goes further here.This is a traditional village, do not expect all the trappings you get from a large tourist location, I hope this place stays like it is, by being traditional it works.Rooms basic but very clean, in fact spotless. Breakfast all home made produce. A sun trap and sunsets are wonderful.If you want quite and solitude for a couple of days to chill, perfect. ","May 22, 2016","18    Ambelia Traditional Villas

Nothing seemed too much trouble for anyone, a smile and an awesome omlette every morning from the team greated us at the pool for breakfast. We had unit 2, a split level sea view villa and it was perfect....clean, spacious and had everything we needed for a total relax. The beds were the most comfortable Ive slept in in paid accommodation. Also, we liked the location which was a 15 minute walk to downtown Oia, close enough for everything including restaurants and shopping of any sort but far enough away to be out of the mayhem of Central Oia. There is a local bus stop just 10 mins walk from the villas which will take you over the whole island.

Although decoration of the room is very simple, that made me feel more authentic local style and reminded me of my grandma's house in a island in my country. Another plus. As it is bit away from Oia, you don't bump with crowds.Downs: Well, for me it was ups but the property is bit far away from Oia centre so if you don't have transportation it can be tough to walk under strong sunlight in summer.","September 11, 2015","18    Ambelia Traditional Villas

918,"Our time at Ambelia Villas was nothing more than average. Staying in a cave villa is really nice and the villa we had at Ambelia was very spacious. However the total experience was nothing to write home about and when taking the cost into account (we booked through hotels.com and paid EUR2,399.00 for 3 days) it was actually below average. Our hosts were helpful and gracious and made a good breakfast each morning. However, this breakfast was no different to what one gets at any other B&B/hotel and actually lacked fresh fruit. On arrival in our room I immediately noticed that the towels were just stacked on a window sill, the baby cot was full of pillows and blankets and not ready to receive a guest, there was grit in the toilet basin from the cracking plaster on the ceiling and when I opened the kitchen cupboard a door knob came off. The following day our bed was pulled straight but the second bed was untouched/not made and the dishes were not washed (there wasn't much even). We asked for it to be taken care of and the next day the beds were made, towels were neatly rolled on the beds and dishes were washed. Finally, I had a crawling baby and the rough cement floors were very hard and sore on his knees. On this trip we stayed in 4 places on different islands and had no problems anywhere else. Also, we stayed in a cave villa in Oia and that place was cheaper, more modern and had a private jacuzzi. There are much better options.","September 3, 2015","18    Ambelia Traditional Villas

920,"Me, the missis and our 15 year old sleeping machine stayed here for two nights last weekend. We arrived on the Blue Star and we jumped on the small bus which the accommodation arranged for 25 Euro (good value for 3 people as taxi was considerably more). Arrived at the villas about 45 minutes later with a bunch of Kiwis who managed to get their bags carried down to their rooms by the staff!We had villa no.5 which had 2 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms and was situated about 20 metres from the bar/pool area. The villa was enormous! You walk in to a lounge area which is about 14ft x 26ft, and there is a small kitchen to one side. We had a super king size bed in our bedroom and our son had a small double. Both bathrooms were spacious and the showers were fantastic for Greece as there was a boiler rather than the usual sun powered bucket of water usually found on the top of Greek apartments!The breakfast was served up in the bar which is next to the pool and there was enough food and variety to keep me going for most of the day (even enough for our 15 year old as he needs to eat at least 5 times per day).I have to mention the people who run the place. Sammy (please excuse the spelling) was the guy running the villas with his wife (apologies for not remembering your name). They couldn't do enough for you, whether it was sorting out a taxi, doing your laundry (bloody Kiwis again!), directions, advice or fixing the bathroom shower-head. I also think the twin boys crawling around without a care in the world really adds to the atmosphere! To walk to the centre of Oia takes 15 minutes. It takes 10 minutes to the start of the pedestrianised area.

921,"Ambelia far exceeded our expectations.The facilities and rooms are modern with fresh decor, the rooms are spacious and each comes with a private patio which is great for sitting out of an evening.Plenty of variety at breakfast and the food is good. The couple who run this place (Sami & his wife) are what really sets it apart though. They remember each guest by name and instantly makes one feel at home. Well done Ambelia ...

922,"We stayed at Ambelia Traditional Villas from 2nd to 9th June incluisve, as a couple going to a friends wedding. The flight out was delayed and for that and various other reasons we arrived at Ambelia close to midnight. The villas manager (Sammi) met us at the local car park which is a close as you can get by transport as the routes around this area are narrow passage-ways suitable for walking and donkeys only! It's a 5-minute walk from this car park to the villas.The decoration was immaculate and the rooms spotless. Bedding and towels clean and fresh, being changed everyday. There was a small CD/radio music unit and hairdrier provided, and ample sockets around to plug chargers in. Don't recall seeing a TV in our rooms, but in such a beautiful place who would stay in and watch TV!!Our accommodation consisted of a private patio area to the front, leading into the main 'living' area with soffa/bed base and cushions with low table and floor cusions. There was an air-con unit but we never used it. Off this was the bathroom with open shower (yes, it can spray around a bit but it is effectively a 'wet room'. This bathrom had the loo and handbasin with mirror over. Hot water was via an electric heater which Sammi showed how to switch on 15 minutes before having a shower.Off the main room is also a kitchenette with two-ring electric hob, normal under counter fridge with freezer compartment, toaster and electric kettle, sink and waste bin. Cuttlery and plates, cups, glasses, pans, frying pan etc. provided. As was washinh-up liquid and cleaning cloth. A small window leeds to the front for ventilation/sunlight.The bedroom extended off the main living area and had door/windows to separate off if required. This had a large soft bed, side tables with lamps, recess with sheleves for storeage and door way to 'walk-in' type wardrobe hanging area with rail and shelves behind.The main front door had windows either side with internal shutters to keep out the light and insect gauze to keep out the bugs.Breakfast is served under cover by the side of the pool area. The usual tea, coffee, with cheese, ham and bread (toaster there too) plus olive pesto, sun-dried tomatoes, capers, Greek yoghurt, tomatoes and olives. Omlettes or fried eggs to order. Some cereals and traditional biscuits also available. The juice was from concentrate and too sugary for me but that is the only criticism.The pool area has loungers and umbrellas, towels are provided.There were two wi-fi units - one in the breakfast area and one outside the accommodation rooms (which are at a lower level) so unless you were right at the back of the accommodation there's always a signal.Sammi was very helpful with what types of tours or places to visit and helped by 'phoning up to book for us. He also walked up with us to local quad/car/scooter hire to make sure we were well looked after.There is a restaurant (Krinaki) just 3 minutes walk away with good food at good prices, although Ambelia were just setting up other meal facilities.It's a 15 minute walk to Oia and I cannot see how anyone could claim it's longer.Overal, superb accommodtion, convenient and with very very helpful and friendly manager and staff. Thoroughly recommended.","June 12, 2015","18    Ambelia Traditional Villas

929,"We stayed here for two nights after staying in Kamari beach. We wanted a cliff side getaway, and Finikia is the perfect spot to get the cliffside experience but away from touristy Oia. The location was great - Finikia is a must see, traditional settlement with a cozy coffee shop off the beaten path, and an amazing authentic restaurant called Krinaki. Also a very walkable distance to Oia - or a short scooter ride away. The hosts were great - I enjoyed chatting with them and they were very helpful, offering a map and tips on where to eat. Our room was the very bottom room - so our view was just out to a bunch of shrubs. It was spacious and visually very appealing. The bed was extremely comfortable and the shower was amazing. Unfortunately, what makes us give this hotel a poor rating was the overwhelming odour of mildew and must that hit you when you entered the room. Our friend who came to visit us in our room even noticed it. Our noses were so stuffed after being in the room for a few minutes that it was hard to sleep, and I just wanted to leave the room.The use of an aircleaner and dehumidifier might help this. We also found it quite buggy - we killed 7 spiders behind the bed before we went to sleep......The breakfast was nothing special. Just some cereal, toast (that they toast for you), and yogurt. The common area was very nice, but the hosts and their son use it as their living area as well, which we found odd when we were sitting outside in the evenings. Next time, we will stay elsewhere due to the smell of mold.","August 10, 2014","18    Ambelia Traditional Villas

930,"The hotel was perfect for our 3-day stay on Santorini. It is not in Oia, but in the neighboring town of Finikia, with beautiful views to the side opposite from the caldera. Our two-bedroom apartment was clean and spacious, just right for our family of four. The hosts were very friendly and helpful, making sure our days were relaxing and fun, they always had some great recommendations about what to do and where to go. Breakfast was homemade and filling. It would not be an easy walk into the center of Oia, so you better rent a car or a quad. Be prepared to climb some steps, but that is the norm for Santorini in general. Wifi only works in the common area near the pool.","August 5, 2014","18    Ambelia Traditional Villas

If you're looking for something right in the middle of one of the towns with bustling night-life, this isn't it.. We loved everything about our stay at Ambelia. We loved the rooms, the breakfast, the view and especially the hosts. In terms of other European hotels that we stayed in, the rooms here were HUGE! We had a sitting area as well as our bedroom. There is even a small kitchenette. To top it all off, the price is VERY reasonable.

932,"We stayed at Ambelia for 3 nights and thoroughly enjoyed this place! It is a stylish and beautiful small hotel with nice view to the Aegean sea. Our cave house was amazing, huge with all the comforts we needed. There some steps to get to the villas but we discovered from the first day that you have to climb stairs everywhere in Santorini unless you stay in a hotel on the road. The breakfast was delicious, authentic homemade greek tastes. The staff was great that gives personal attention to every guest. Finikia is the ideal spot to relax, not far away from Oia’s town. We read some reviews about the location that it’s far away from Oia and you should to walk a lot, but our opinion is that travelers should to read the information more carefully because they say on their website and on Booking.com page that Ambelia is located in Finikia, 800 meters from Oia and we can tell u that Finikia is a very beautiful and traditional village, not crowded and very close to Oia’s town. We also stayed for two nights on the cliff side in Fira, the view was amazing but our room was small and many steps also to climb. So after that, we realized that you pay much money only for the view (that it’s really gorgeous), and I say that, for those people who complain about this, they don't realise what Santorini is all about. We hope to come back soon and stay at Ambelia’s hotel. There is a nice (it’s new) swimming pool in the hotel that you can relax and watch also the sunset from there. Thanks guys for all.","July 16, 2014","18    Ambelia Traditional Villas

936,"We were picked up at the ferry terminal by a transfer that the hotel had arranged for us. They were in time and polite enough. When they dropped us off at the hotel, we walked down the 5 minute walk down the cobbled steps to arrive at the villa where Sammy was waiting for us with a huge smile and a friendly hello. After a long day of travel that is exactly what we needed.He showed us to our villa, which was a cute little 'cave' type house. Everything was lovely, from the comfy double bed, the well equipped kitchen, the huge shower and even the general amenities needed, such as the hair dryer to keep the girlfriend happy!Once we had settled in, we decided we wanted to rent a quad bike, to which Sammy jumped at the opportunity to help us, he took us down to a local quad bike rental in his car, a short two or three minute drive, where we rented the quad the duration of our time there.This helpfulness from Sammy continued throughout the whole stay. On our third day it our anniversary, and I had asked Sammy to arrange something special for us, so he went to the capital of the island, a good 15 minute drive, to pickup some specific flowers for the girlfreind, and while we were out, arranged them in our villa nicely.The next great thing about ambelia was the breakfasts... Oh the breakfasts! I had heard off some reviews before we arrived that the breakfast was disappointing, and that it consisted just of bread. These are wrong! Sammy was constantly bringing us fresh juices, toast, and continental breakfast, and when we thought that was amazing, he asked us if we would like anything else, a omelette, a toastie, I slice of fresh homemade cake made from wife's recipe. All in all, this was a perfect stay at ambelia traditional villas. The location is slightly out of town, but only about a ten minute walk, 15 max! But the price, the decor and ambience, and Sammy more than make up for the little walk.

940,"We really enjoyed our stay in Ambelia. From the minute we arrived we were made to feel very welcome. The cave villa was very spacious and very cool with everything we needed for our 8 night stay. The bed was large and nice and comfortable and the villa was spotlessly clean. Towels were changed daily and the owners offered to do any washing we had free of charge.The breakfast area was lovely and there was something for everyone. The homemade jams/marmalade were beautiful, as were the cakes. We had breakfast at our villa on a few occasions too. We had freshly made omelette every morning too. Ambelia is located in a traditional Greek village which we loved, there is a taverna in the village and it's very peaceful away from the hustle and bustle of Oia, but within easy walking distance taking 10mins. If you want to view the sunset from it's best vantage point it's about a 20 mins walk. This was not a problem for us and actually very enjoyable after dinner in Oia.We would definitely recommend Ambelia, it was great value for money and we received a genuinely warm and friendly reception from the couple who manage the villas. They recommended many places for us to eat and visit and were happy to make reservations/book taxi to airport for us. Nothing was too much trouble.

941,"We stayed at Ambelia for our first leg of our stay (3 nights) in Santorini before meeting friends in Fira. It was hard to know what to expect when we booked this online as this is our first time in Greece. I wish we could have spent our whole stay in Santorini at Ambelia but the place was not available when our friends arrived. This place is beautiful and for us, it was way more than what we had expected. We had spent time in Athens and Mykonos already and has been staying in small quarters (there were three if us) so our 2 room suite was heavenly. I liked our view of the northeast. We didn't mind the short walk into Oia and did this walk several times a day. This was not at all a problem for us. We preferred and loved how peaceful it was here and that it was away from the hussle and bustle of Oia. The couple who run Ambelia are truly wonderful, extremely hospitable and are the kindest people ever. They gave us lots of tips, drove us to the dock for a boat excursion, and even did our laundry for no extra charge. The breakfast meal had something for everyone's taste. The managers have many great recommendations. A highlight for us was the walk down and back up the stairs to Amoudi; we swam in the bay to the left of the restaurants as recommended by the managers. It was truly amazing and I am so glad we found out about this; make sure to bring water shoes. And swim and explore the little uninhabited island at the bay. I can see why so many travellers love Ambelia and gave it high ratings. And for the not so great reviews, I agree: if you don't like to walk, do stairs or be in a more secluded part of Santorini, this is NOT the place for you. But for us, we would definitely stay here again! ","July 19, 2013","18    Ambelia Traditional Villas

942,"We chose to stay here as it was slightly cheaper than the places closer in to the main part of Oia, but still only about 700 metres or something right into the centre of things. We were greeted by the friendly onsite manager who even carried our bags for us down to our apartment/cave room. The room was really large with a little kitchen and was very clean. It had a private outdoor sort of area with nice views out over the ocean. As with most Santorini accommodation, there were lots of stairs, but if you aren't prepared to tackle stairs I would recommend avoiding Santorini altogether! There were lots of little convenience stores close by, and a cute little restaurant that did both take away and dine in. We were able to call up and order our food and then go to get it and eat it out on our little patio overlooking the ocean. The only downside was that we didn't have wifi in our room, but we were able to access free wifi in the communal area where we were served delicious and generous breakfasts home cooked by our hosts, so this made up for any reason for us to be upset!! They also did our washing for us (we were weary for a few months of travel so this was so so so so appreciated!).I loved this place, and I loved our friendly hosts who provided us with just about everything that we could want.

949,"My husband and our 21 year old daughter stayed several nights in May, 2019. The hospitality was wonderful. Breakfast was perfect. We had not been to Santorini since our honeymoon 25 years ago. We were pleased to see that once you leave the main tourist areas, the old charm still exists. We hiked up to the church on the hill. The hillside was in full bloom with wild flowers. The scent of blooming thyme was incredible. I would certainly return to Samson's Village is I make it back to the island.","June 7, 2019","19    Samson's Village

950,"This hotel is within 3 minutes ish from the beach , and if you've hired a car parking is easy. Staff here are very friendly and helpful. The hotel has 21 rooms which are well appointed and comfy. Great pool and lounge chairs to sun yourself and a bar if you want to give the beach a miss. Only small worry for Same One is that they have no proper kitchen , and so provide snacks and breakfast from their cramped bar ... so eating out on the seafront , and all over Santorini has been a great experience. Plenty of eateries here at Perissa across the long beautiful seafront , including even a really great indian restaurant.We both would like to come back to Samsons again.","May 12, 2019","19    Samson's Village

As well it should be said what a lovely complex, well kept rooms were of a great size and spotlessly clean. Our only criticism, which note don't stop us giving 5 stars would be that a slightly larger bathroom would be preferable, however everything worked well.

953,"We stayed at the gorgeous Samson’s Village for a week in August, with the aim of a relaxing holiday whilst still having time to explore the sites and scenery of the beautiful island. Having landed in Santorini at 1am local time it was 2am by the time we arrived from the airport via a pre arranged transfer with the hotel. The driver met us at the airport and was very friendly, carrying our bags and giving us a descriptive tour of the island whilst driving us to Samson’s. As it was late when we arrived at the hotel he provided us with the pre arranged key card and showed us to our room. The room was beautiful, clean and traditionally decorated. Had a small kitchen with a hob, fridge, kettle and enough utensils to make a basic meal. The bathroom was a little on the small size but that’s probably traditional but nothing that wasn’t usable or practical. The next morning we visited reception where we met Helen who was very polite, and more than happy to assist us in getting the most out of our visit. She provided us with useful information about the hotel and local restaurant offers, places to visit locally in Perissa as well as locations for shops, the bus stop in addition to timings for the buses and different options of getting about the island. Helen also provided us with various trips and excursions available to do whilst on the island in addition to car hire options. Any further questions we had or if we wanted anything organising she was more than happy to do it all for us and go that extra mile to ensure we had a great stay. All the staff were so helpful and welcoming and made our stay one of the best we’ve experienced whilst holidaying across many parts of Europe. Minas who runs the bar (also does a lot of other jobs at the hotel if you ask him too) was great, providing us with entertainment, humour and all round great customer service. Nothing was ever too much for him or Helen who both go above and beyond to ensure you have the best stay possible and are a credit to Samson’s.Samson’s Village is in an ideal location, just a minutes walk from the Black Beach and the bars and restaurants that run along its front. Helen provided us with a card for 10% off at Apollo and Acropolis restaurants which we used which is a nice touch. Helen organised a boat trip for us, as well as car hire fir a day which we used to explore the island, in particular Oia and Pyrgos, where we watched the sunset over the island. With our return flight home in the early hours and check out at 12:30pm, we still made the most of our last day on the island and decided on spending it relaxing by the pool with a few of the other guest we’d made friends with during our stay, not to mention Minas and Helen who we shared drinks with by the pool before our transfer home. Early checkout from our room didn’t affect us as Helen, Minas and owner Joan happily let us use the bathroom facilities at reception to freshen ourselves up before our onward journey. Samson’s is a small hotel that is quaint, picturesque yet full of character with great customer service. We had a fantastic time and highly recommend staying at Samson’s Village - we will definitely come back! Seb & AliceXX","August 27, 2018","19    Samson's Village

Every day you found the rom clean and new towels , we were happy to meet Milos (the boy at the bar), Heleny (receptionist) and Ianis (manager), these people made our stay very pleasant. The breakfast is very good and you can choice of a smaller or bigger, smaller 8€ , bigger 10€ ( very good prices).

956,"My friend and I stayed at Samson Villas in Perissa, Santorini for 5 nights from 4th July 2018.We choose Perissa based on recommendations from friends, we choose well.Samson Villas was selected on pictures, location and amenities.It's about 25-30 mins from the airport, we had room 4. It was like a 2 bed studio, no door between rooms but separate. Making a big difference to the sleeping, flow and vibe of the holiday. Excellent AC, worked a treat, fridge, wardrobe, safe, hairdryer (wall mounted), shower, products, thick clean towels daily. The beds were supremely comfortable and the pillow was good quality, not a wafer!The pool is set at the rear of this establishment, so no roadside peepers. Bar open from 8.30 to 11.30pm, snack drinks usual suspects, tasty and fresh.Minas at the bar is understated, but attentive and keeps the area surpervised and clean. Sunbeds and towels, which can be taken to the beach, which is 5 mins away.The design of each villa appears different, but the classic blue and white is very authentic and tasteful..Housekeeping is high quality, on site, visible and helpful. Check in & out smooth and easy, also you can use the pool and facilities without charge, there's a shower room in the Reception area that you can use before your onwards journey.1st time in Santorini and Samson villas, will definitely be back, and I highly recommend this establishment. Its an excellent base for your holiday and the caring team of Helen, Minas and John provide a calm vibe and happy surroundings even better.:)) ","July 9, 2018","19    Samson's Village

958,"I recently stayed at Samsons Village as part of a wedding party.I booked a room that slept 4 people although only 2 of us occupied the room.The location of Samson's village at Perissa beach is very good. A 2 minute walk to the beach and an abundance of restaurants.The room was fine. To accommodate 4 people the layout of the room includes a mezzanine floor with a double bed and 2 single beds at ground level. With 2 adults it was fine, with 4 adults in the room I expect it may feel a bit of a squeeze. The room also provided a good sized balcony front and backThe hotel has a modest size pool and a pool bar.The best part of the hotel and the highlight for the group was the staff. The staff were very friendly, accommodating and went above and beyond to meet our needs and if they are reading this I would like to express on behalf of the group our thanks for looking after us so well.I would have no hesitation in recommending Samson's village","June 20, 2018","19    Samson's Village

959,"Our first visit to Greece & very happy we decided to stay at Samsons Village.We stayed 8 nights.Very friendly management & staff especially Helen in reception.we had booked an economy studio which was excellent value for money,There is no balcony in economy but plenty of space with a small terrace with 2 chairs. The king size bed is huge & very comfortable,There is also good air conditioning.A small kitchen area & a good size fridge. A television but no international channels. The bathroom is small but one problem the floor is always very wet.There is also a safe in the studio.plenty of wardrobe space for 2 people,There is a great pool with comfortable sunloungers.There is a poolside bar serving drinks coffees etc.You can take breakfast around the pool area but it’s disappointing.. €6 is good value but the quality is not good.There are some great bakery’s in the area and I am surprised Samsons don’t get nice fresh bread, rolls baguettes etc rather than supermarket sliced bread.Samsons is located less then 2 minutes from the beach with plenty of restaurants & sunloungers on the beach.The sea was warm enough to swim in.A visit to Ola to see the sunset is a must and Samsons can arrange transport.So to sum up a lovely holiday & we would hope to return to Samsons next year","June 11, 2018","19    Samson's Village

960,"We stayed at Samson's Village for eight nights for our honeymoon. It's a lovely layout and looks just like the pictures. Our room was lovely and clean and an alright size. We had a kitchenette and table, bathroom and bedroom. In the corridor was plenty of wardrobe space with a safe too. We also had a balcony area with table and chairs. Our room was cleaned daily with fresh towels and the whole hotel area and pool was kept lovely and clean.The staff were all so helpful and nice. This made a big difference with our stay! It was the perfect location too. Just around the corner from the beach and loads of nice restaurants nearby. We much preferred the Perissa area as it didn't have all the cruse ships like the other towns. There is also a bus stop at the end of the road to Fira and a small village supermarket.There were only two small things - a tea towel in the kitchen would have been really handy to wash our dishes, as we ended up using one of the hand towels! Also there was not always a staff member around the pool, so were sometimes waiting to see someone to ask for a drink. However we did go at the start of May and this was before the season fully started.Overall such a lovely place and we would definitely come back!","May 24, 2018","19    Samson's Village

The staff - Yannis, Marinos and Konstantina - were very helpful and friendly. A special thanks to Marinos who worked so hard and was so lovely to chat to. The housekeeping staff were also fantastic and the accommodation was cleaned daily and it was spotless. The hotel is only 2 minutes from the beach and 5 minutes from the waterpark which our children appreciated. It has a very chilled out feel to it which has been a welcome change from previous all-inclusive holidays and there are loads of beautiful restaurants to choose from nearby. Once again, thanks to everyone at Samson's and we would highly recommend it.","August 19, 2017","19    Samson's Village

962,"Having booked Samson’s Village on the internet we were hopeful that it would live up to expectations as you can never really be sure about a place until you get there. Samson’s Village surpassed expectations. It is a beautiful set of self-catering apartments maintained to very high standards. It was nicely decorated and well laid out. The complex is perfectly located a couple of minutes walk from the beach in one direction and a couple of minutes from the main street in the other. The young people who run the place, John, Konstantina and Marinos, are lovely and go out of their way to make sure every guest has the best stay they can have. They are always friendly, happy and very helpful. The rooms were very well maintained, cleaned every day and fresh, fluffy towels changed daily. Other touches which made the apartments stand out were things like liquid hand soap in the bathroom and washing up liquid in the kitchen. The apartments were all very well equipped and we even had a brand new toastie maker in ours as well as a new halogen hob! Unusually for these types of apartments the air conditioning and safe were included in the price which was nice and the free wifi was very good too. The pool area was quite small but very nice, always clean and they provided large towels for use round the pool and on the sun loungers. The rooms vary in style and size and as we were a large party I saw several different rooms, all of them very nice. The first room we had (35) was lovely. It was on the second floor so there were quite a few steps up to it which might be a problem for some people. It had a large balcony at the front with views of the mountains as well as a private sun deck at the back. It was quite spacious with a double bed and a single. The only problem for us was that the double bed was on a mezzanine floor up some steep, open stairs. Whilst it looked nice it wasn’t suitable for us because of the steep stairs (wife has a dodgy knee). Without any fuss Konstantina changed us to another room (12) which was just as nice but on the first floor and the whole apartment was on one level. The lowest level rooms don’t have balconies or a view as they are below ground level but are cheaper because of this. Having stayed in many different self-catering apartments in various Greek islands I can honestly say that Samson’s were the best and I would definitely recommend them to anyone. This was a very special holiday as it involved 48 relatives and friends all getting together for the wedding of my youngest niece. Having been to Santorini before we chose Perissa as the resort to stay because it is very flat and everything is close together making it most suitable for my mum in her wheelchair. We had 14 nights at the beginning of June and wish we could have stayed longer. Many thanks to John, Konstantina and Marino for helping to make this the best holiday ever for all our extended family.","July 7, 2017","19    Samson's Village

964,"I do not do reviews very often but this hotel definitely deserves an excellent review!! We (my husband and myself) were welcomed at the airport and driven to the hotel by the hotel owner Giannis (John) who is such a humble, kind and pleasant man. Check in was quick and efficient. Our first impression of the hotel was that we needed to take pictures of this very pretty setting immediately! We stayed 15 nights and could have stayed a lot longer! We just loved being there for many reasons: All the staff were excellent at what they did and service could not have been better. The hotel surroundings were beautiful, the room was spacious and kept clean by the efficient staff, the kitchen facilities were adequate, the pool area was 1st class, quiet and relaxing. We did have a problem with confirmation of our British Airways flight but Konstantina was so helpful in fixing that issue. She even messaged us to see if we had managed to get on the 'plane and reached our next destination and to make sure that we were safe (That was the week of the London disaster). A very pleasant, efficient lady who is a valuable staff member and a credit to the hotel. Marinos was another staff member who made a big impression on us for his very pleasant manner, efficiency and again his humility won our hearts. He took us back to the airport and he enlightened us re some of the history of the Island and Greece.In summary, this is one of the best hotels we have every stayed in and we have stayed in many over the years! Hats off to the wonderful staff! We would definitely recommend this hotel!","June 12, 2017","19    Samson's Village

Our room is the one right in front of the pool that they are using for their main image. The room was great, spacious and very clean. The pool was nice and we relaxed in it a few times. The walk to the beach was only a few minutes and it put your right at a spot that had tons of restaraunts, gelato joints and Gyros! There is a GREAT gyro place down the plaka! Then, the main road in to Perissa is another quick walk and right at the end is a market that we shopped at for wine, beer and some veggies. What topped it off though was leaving. We had a 00:45 flight to Rome. The staff let us keep our stuff in the main lobby, let us use their restroom to bathe and clean up and helped arrange a pick up for us to the airport.

The rest of the family had arrived the day before, but that's what happens when you lose your passport: you end up on the 2am flight from Rome arriving Thira at 5am.But it was worth it. Samson's is a special place. Most people seem to stay for a few nights but we were there for 15. Everything was about perfect; the pool was literally half a dozen steps away from our room, it was mostly empty, and there was hardly any fighting for sun loungers. Some new arrivals tried to reserve loungers for the whole day, including during extended lunches. But I found you could just wait for half an hour, then move their stuff. When (if) they come back many hours later, just deny all knowledge of anything. However, it might be useful if the management put up a notice saying ""sun loungers cannot be reserved"" in 5 languages, as this might help prevent antisocial behaviour.Anyway, that's a small quibble. The staff were incredibly helpful, especially John, the owner. When one of our kids was ill and had to go to the doctor at 10pm, John not only drove us there but on to the hospital afterwards. He only went home at 2am when we insisted on it - otherwise he would have stayed all night. I have never come across this level of helpfulness in a hotel. Part of it may be just the Greek character, but most of it was simply John. Many, many thanks.We were in room 13. Ideally placed for the pool and the wifi, but it only had a two-person terrace for 4 people. We mentioned this to Anna in reception, and she insisted that we should just use the bar tables just outside the room instead. As the bar area was almost deserted most evenings, we effectively had our own large poolside terrace.So, one of the best holiday hotels I've stayed in - especially for the price.","August 16, 2016","19    Samson's Village

981,"Everything about Samson's village was exactly what we had hoped for after seeing all the positive reviews online. The staff were so helpful and friendly, going out of their way to help us plan trips, make restaurant bookings and always had time to answer questions. We felt so welcomed from the moment we were fetched from the Ferry until we were dropped at the airport. The pool area was an oasis of calm and relaxation - we ordered cocktails from the friendly barmen and tanned or soaked in the lovely water. Our room was compact but we were expecting that. Very comfortable bed!! Bathroom was clean and had everything we needed. Again they have used space wisely so it is a little compact, but how much time do you spend inside? Not much with all that Mediterranean sun and sea calling you outside! The little kitchenette was a real bonus and the table and chairs outside our room were nice for having a drink.We did take a peek into a few other units and they all varied in size and layout so it really depends which one you get. I think we had unit 12.The location of the Hotel is excellent. Just two tiny little streets away from Perissa main beach - with lots of restaurants and sunbeds. I fell in love with this place, so relaxing! If you enjoy swimming - bring swimming goggles as you could swim for miles along Perissa beach! Also only 3min walk from a mini-market where we stocked up on snacks and drinks a few times. There was a bus that could take you to Fira and from there to all over the island. We took the bus a few times and once or twice took taxi's.Thanks to all at Samson's Village for making this such an amazing holiday for us!!","July 1, 2016","19    Samson's Village

982,"We're coming to the end of our stay in santorini and we have had a wonderful time. Firstly, the hotel is brilliant-welcome is second to none (try to remember to book your transfer directly with the hotel for €15 each way). Rooms are fairly basic but more than adequate. Main things are that the beds are nice and comfy and facilities clean. Kitchenette area has 2 hot plates. The shower areas are quite small and compact but wasn't a major problem for the 2 of us as we pretty much only used the room to sleep in and ate out most days.The main feature of the hotel is the pool area which is so so peaceful. The sun loungers are exceptionally comfortable and the area is a total sun trap. It really is perfect. The complex is very small which adds to the tranquility but the pool area is more than adequate. Pool temperature was perfect too! Jon (hotel owner) told us to make ourselves at home and enjoy the use of the pool area/furniture as much as we liked. Nobody from the hotel hassles you for meals/gifts/information, you are just left alone to enjoy your holiday. Anna (manager) and (Jon) amongst other staff are always on hand to answer any questions/provide assistance/recommendations/dinner reservations. They have a fantastic team of people working here.Location was amazing-30 second walk to main strip in perissa where we ate out most nights. We travelled to Oia which was stunning but I'm glad we stayed where we were and made the visit there as it seemed inundated with tourists/very busy. Prices on island are generally higher in oia too. Our favourite lunch was the gigantic salads at 'tranquilo' (only buy one between 2) and we also enjoyed the gyros from 'grandma's recipe''Noxa' was our favourite place for dinner. Most of the other eateries are fairly similar.Overall loved the holiday and we're pretty certain we want to come back again next year! ","June 17, 2016","19    Samson's Village

984,"This is my second trip to Santorini, this time I stayed at Samsons village after reading trip advisor reviews and it does not disappoint. I stayed for 4 days where I was meeting friends for a reunion holiday. I emailed the hotel before to ask for transfers to and from the airport which was £15 each way. They were so friendly on arrival and nothing is too much to do. My room was no. 5 up on the top floor and it had a balcony view of the pool, was clean, spacious, has aircon and love the little kitchenette. The hotel is less than 2 mins walk from Perissa beach which is the best for a bit of pool and beach time. The pool is clean, & had a lovely little bar with cocktails and snacks. This is a family run hotel and it's really nice atmosphere. Anna at reception is just lovely, & helped sort us out a table in Oia to watch the sunset and transport back that evening which was brilliant and not too expensive. There is a supermarket on the beach front and one on the main Street 2 mins walk which is perfect to grab essentials like water and snacks. The bus stop to Fira is also 2 mins walk away and may not always be reliable but safer than driving yourself round those busy streets. Perissa beach is great with lots of bars and restaurants for breakfast and dinner. If you buy a drink or eat at one you can use the sunbeds for free... The only little improvement to the hotel I would say is the bathroom had a feint damp smell and the shower curtain just needs to be a little bit longer to stop water going all over the floor. But otherwise this place is a gem and I would recommend to anyone who wants a friendly homely place to stay. I will definitely be staying here again when I visit the beautiful Santorini :) ","June 10, 2016","19    Samson's Village

985,"Very close to the beach and the main strip of restaurants and shops in Perissa (2 minute walk). The room was cleaned daily and we were provided with clean bed sheets and towels daily too. Yiannis was very helpful and friendly, always willing to chat. TV showing Premier League football by the swimming pool was a bonus. The complex looks very nice from the outside with the classic Santorini theme of whitewashed walls and blue doors, gates, windows. As it is a small island we didn't feel like we were missing out on anything by not booking in Fira, however, having a rental car is ideal as we were able to explore the entire island. There was plenty of parking space outside Samson's, something you will struggle with if you stay in Fira. Overall very happy with Samson's. Good value for money, i.e you get what you pay for.","April 27, 2016","19    Samson's Village

988,"Thanks to Samson's Village for our lovely 6night stay!Our little studio was well equipped, quiet, and just right for the two of us. It had a decent sized fridge with kettle sink and two jobs as well as a small supply of crockery and cutlery for your grub. Table and chairs in the kitchenette but weather was so good we used the balcony mainly.Bed was a decent size and the balcony is accessed off the bedroom.Bathroom compact but shower was lovely and warm with good pressure. The complex was well looked after, safe and very clean with friendly efficient staff. Whilst we didn't have breakfast (supermarkets very near so brought food) or use the pool or bar area but it all looked very attractive and never over-busy.Location is spot on! On a quiet street 2minutes walk from the beach front with a huge variety of restaurants, shops and amenities stretching across the beautiful black sands of Perissa beach.We hired a car but the bus stops for the local bus towards Fira etc. were in easy walking distance up on the main road.***Navigation Tip: to find Samson's Village - off the main Perissa Road heading from Fira/Airport with the sea on your right ... look for Dorian's Pub and the yellow painted dive shop - there's a small turning between them on the right. Pass a few hotels on your right then take next road right following a sign for Mama's Food. The hotel is on your left with right parking outside it!***We got lost a few times on our first arrival and there are signs to Samson's Village but not at eye-line and the locals aren't feat with their directions!We were really thrilled with the great value for money and the quality of service we got from the guys at Samson's Village we were sorry to come to the end of our stay.Things to do : Hike from Perissa to Kamari over the Mesa Vouno (the big mountain to the left as you face the sea) well signposted and some good instructions online at santorini-walksBoat cruise including Volcano Palea Kameni, thermal springs at Nea Kameni and time in Thirassia. Bus picked us up from the info office in Perissa took us to the harbour and dropped us back as we didn't get off for the sunset in Oia but did it independently.Walk from Fira to Oia...STUNNING walk suitable for most fitness levels with amazing views the whole way. Easy bus ride back to Fira after.Visit Fira and Oia towns.Oia sunset, would recommend getting there early as it does get busy and bagging a spot in the old castle ruins at the far end : great views of both sides of Oia and the sunset over the caldera.Lots of great signposted walks e.g. Akrotiri to Red Beach, Perissa to Pyrgos/Profitas Illias (monastery up on the hill behind Samson's)Eat well! Perissa : Huge salads for 2 at Tranquilo, pasta at Pergola, souvlaki at Volcano, great value mixed grill for 2 at Apollon and chilled ambiance/sport on tv/great value drinks at Sellada. All up to 5mins walk from Samson's Village!Enjoy!","October 23, 2015","19    Samson's Village

989,"Great guidance by the very kind host. As we did not want to stay in the 'sugarly romantic'ioa, we choose Samsons in perissa. Helped us wonderful by pick up and drop off in the middle of the night and to rent the car.Most beautiful is the black beach as backyard, colours of the sky are amazing and changes every hour at sunset like an oil painting!

990,"This is a great location, as only a short walk from Perissa beach, one of the nicest beaches on the island. You can easily wander to shops, restaurants and bars, but at the same time Samsons village is quiet and peaceful, so you get the best if both. This is a family run business and the staff are friendly and helpful.The accomodation is beautiful on the outside with a lovely courtyard and very clean pool. On the inside it is simple, bright and kept clean, we even got clean towels every day. The bed was comfortable and there was generous storage and hanging space for clothes-always a plus! There is a supermarket a ten minute walk away which is well stocked with a great combination of local produce and well known brands from around the world, so we stocked up our kitchen on arrival.I recommend a boat trip to the volcano, hot springs, thirassia island and Oiia village for the sunset. We also hired a quad bike and headed into Fira and explored the island, which was great fun (of course car hire is available locally too if you dont fancy a quad bike.) The staff at samsons can book trips for you, or you can visit a local agent.We highly enjoyed our time in Santorini and were perfectly happy with our choice of accomodation. This is not luxury accomodation, but very pleasant self-catered accomodation and if that's what you are looking for I highly recommend Samsons village.","September 16, 2015","19    Samson's Village

993,"My wife and I stayed at Samson's Village for 7 nights, we really did have a great time and enjoyed our stay. We chose Samson's based on the very good reviews and we were certainly not disappointed. Very pretty, well maintained grounds with the traditional Santorini blue and white colours and lovely pink flowers around the grounds. Pool was well kept and very clean, I wanted to take a plunge when I came back from the beach as it was nice and relaxing. Studio apartment was not big but a good size for 2 people. The room had air conditioning which was one of our key requirements as it gets very warm in Greece. The room also had cooking facilities, pot, pan, cutlery, dishes and bowls, as well as a kettle and fridge with small freezer section. Also, a lovely balcony to relax. The location is superb. 3 mins walk to Piressa beach which is the best beach on the island and around 5-10mins walk to the main shops (minimarkets etc), bars and car/quads/bikes hire which we used. We were greeted by John on arrival, who is a really nice guy and very welcoming. He will help you with any requests that you may have about places to go and suppliers to use. Free transfers were included which was an added bonus. If you are looking for very good accommodation at some of the best prices in Santorini I would not hesitate but to recommend this place.

They take you to the airport for free and let you use a spare bedroom if you need to freshen up arriving before check in time. Rooms are very clean and the pool and common areas are lovely. Cons: no toiletries in the bathrooms and no printer or business computer to check your reservations. Restaurants, supermarkets, ATM, beach bars and souvenir stores within walking distance.

Pros: loved Panos and John who made sure that we have everything that we need. You don't see that kind of hospitality in big named hotels. I loved that they took care of all our concerns. They took us to the airport for free and they made sure everything was comfortable. If something broke, they fixed it. Beds were comfy. It has a full kitchen, hair dryer. Also, they helped us with a couple tours. Panos answered all our questions about santorini Cons: the showers could use a bit more space, maybe take out the curtains and replace with glass. Could do away with the breakfast. There are restaurants within a 5 min walk from the hotel that serves omelettes while overlooking the sea.Buy toiletries because they don't have it.

Whether its the location which was near a bus stop so you can easily go to Fira and extremely easy access to the Oia downtown area with all the restaurants and of course the amazing Oia sunset from the castle. But the best part for us, being on our honeymoon was the amazing customer service. From reserving the room with Mrs. Eva to the welcoming and service upon arrival by Sofia and Maria. They all make sure that every part of your visit and trip count. They provided help with restaurant recommendations as well as help with the reservations of the restaurant and any other tour etc. Also A VERY important thing to note, is that they deal with very organized and safe tours. Its not just a random company. Honestly, an AMAZING trip to Santorini and a great reason for that was Oia Suites.","September 24, 2018","20    Oia Suites

You feel most welcomed by them and they become like family. We stayed in a spacious double room suite with our adult daughters and felt like we were in our own private little villa. Breakfast of your choice is brought to your very own outdoor patio and this is how you start your wonderful day. The Cliff side view is amazing, a true Santorini experience. The main center in Oia with all its magnificent restaurants and shops is a short walk away. There are a variety of wonderful restaurants with magnificent sunset views right across the road from this hotel.

1012,"Wow...Sofia, Maria and of course Armando are absolutely amazing. They went above and beyond at all times to make sure we had the best time at Oia Suites. I have never in my life had hotel staff, come out of the office and greet us every time we came back to the hotel it was like they were welcoming us back home every time. Armando made sure we always had ICE cold water by the pool and wine! I have never had this type of service even at all inclusive 5-star resorts.The breakfast was very good every morning, you can pick what you want and it is delivered RIGHT to your front terrace at the time you want. They even include a daily Oia Suites newsletter to read with your breakfast :)Our room was very neat and clean and had 2 air conditioner units to ensure the living room area and bedroom were nice and cool during the summer. It was ~30 degrees everyday we were in Santorini and the room was always very cool. I LOVED IT!!!The location was perfect as well, it is a short walk to the centre of Oia, but once you are there you realize how noisy and crowded it is. We were so very happy to come back to our QUITE and relaxing room. It truly is an oasis nestled in the hills of Oia. The only issue was the wireless signal was not reliable. I generally used my cell phone data and shared it to my iPad while at the hotel as the Wifi signal would often drop. Sofia did warn us the wireless signal may not be that strong, and I appreciate that she let us know.We loved Oia Suites so much we have already recommended other friends come here for a vacation/honeymoon, and we are thinking about when we would like to come back in the future.","August 19, 2018","20    Oia Suites

1014,The view from this hotel was worth the price alone. We loved that it wasn’t in the center of oia so we could enjoy some peace and quiet. Oia was only a short 10 minute walk from the hotel. A nice walking path was there for us to use. Maria and CLara were both so helpful and had an answer to all our questions. My favorite part? The breakfast! So delicious! The staff even packed us sandwiches and snacks for our very early departure. The staff also booked transfers to and from the port and airport with a very reliable company. We loved the junior suite.

1015,"I chose this hotel from the many options available on Santorini based on reviews, price and location. Oia is a must see part of Santorini but can be very busy, crowded and noisy. Oia Suites is located about a 15 minute walk into the town, on the clifftop path. You get the caldera view, the 'cave house' architecture and the Santorini stay experience without the price tag and the crowds that come with staying in the heart of Oia.This property is a small hotel managed and run by around 5 staff who take pride in anticipating and attending to your every need. From George who looks after the pool area and brings you drinks to Sofia and Maria who share front of house and bring your breakfast, they are all just lovely. The room cleaners also are awesome with a surprise awaiting you with flower petals on your bed or towel sculptures each day.Our room was No 1 with gorgeous views across the caldera. A spacious sitting room with small fridge and a bedroom with a very comfortable bed and cute 'cave' bathroom completed the accommodation. All areas were clean and touches like the extendable washing line to hang wet bathers were appreciated.The pool area was located on the lower level, with a steep stairway down to it and the clifftop path. This should be taken into consideration for those who have mobility issues, however most of Santorini accommodation has this limitation. We spent many mornings lazing around the pool - thanks to George ever vigilant to our arrival providing umbrella and drink service as required :).Breakfast is provided daily and is adequate. The staff are able to assist with booking tours, rental cars etc. We walked everywhere, including the 11km cliff and mountain climb into Fira. The local bus service is also good. There are many good restaurants available in Oia and we also enjoyed meals in the tavern across the road from Oia Suites. We thoroughly enjoyed this hotel - we prefer smaller more personal properties and this one ticked all the boxes for us. Thanks to all of the staff - you made our week here just beautiful.","July 10, 2018","20    Oia Suites

Maria has suggested a couple of restaurants and have made bookings for us. Great restaurants and we have enjoyed good nights out.

1017,"First of all, I want to thank Maria and Sophia who made our stay so very special. Always with a smile each one of them greeted us warmly every time they saw us. They laughed with us and shared many suggestions. In short, they were the perfect hosts! As for the hotel, it was the perfect place for us. It was a 20 minute walk into town so we didn't have the congestion and the noise of Oia. I am a 70 year-old man and I found the walk to Oia be a good workout, but very doable. Let's start with the breakfast. It is basically how you design it. On arrival, you are given a sheet listing 20 or so items available for breakfast. You indicate next to each item how many of those you would like to have for breakfast the next morning. If you want four slices of bacon, you put a 4 in the box next to bacon. If you want one cup of coffee , you put a 1 in the coffee box. It may sound a little complicated, but it really isn't and it works well. Breakfast is served each morning on your patio at the time you select. The breakfast foods were excellent. The rooms were wonderful. We had a Superior Suite with Hot Tub and Caldera View and it was fabulous! The bed was large and very comfortable. The bathroom was also roomy. The showers were amazing, with a both a rain shower head and hand held shower head at each end of the shower. Wifi was free and very strong. The staff responded immediately to any request. We love the Oia Suites and I would highly recommend staying here!!!","June 4, 2018","20    Oia Suites

All staff were wonderful and friendly, it was so easy to talk to them and nothing was too much trouble. We had to check out very early on our last day due to a boat trip so they arranged for breakfast to come a little earlier than their usual start time so we could have a chance to enjoy it without rushing too much.I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend Oia Suites to anyone travelling to santorini!!

1019,"My wife and I stayed here for 4 days and we couldn't have chosen a better hotel in Santorini. Right from the welcome to the rooms, the service and the divine views of the ocean, everything seemed tailor-made and perfect.We had asked for the transfer (a paid extra) from the airport to the hotel since we would be arriving past midnight, and the driver was waiting for us at the airport. We had the junior suite with hot tub & ocean view and the room (pictures attached) was spotless and well set-up for us, with a welcoming bottle of champagne (Gancia Brut, pretty good). Every day, the housekeeping staff made towel art for us with the new towels and it was absolutely adorable. Kostas (apologies if I'm misspelling his name) and the ladies did an absolutely fantastic job, many thanks to them.The breakfast, laid out at the table outside at the time of our request, was good but the view we had while eating made it great. We didn't use the pool but it looked spectacular and I'm sure it would have been amazing to use it. The bathrooms were cleaned up superbly every day before we returned from our excursions around the island. We had rented a car and Oia itself is little more than a 5-min drive away. There's a supermarket at walking distance (5-10 mins, you can buy snacks, alcohol and other necessities) and the slightly expensive but good Lefkes restaurant is really close by and stays open till 11 PM or so. The Internet in the rooms is good enough. The TV has about 4-5 channels in English and two of these are news channels, so prepare to watch the same things over & over again if you want to stay in the room and watch TV. But then, if you're in Santorini, why would you do that?Now for the reception staff. Maria, who's been working here for a while, and Sofia, who started recently, made sure our trip was a delight. They were friendly, helpful and sharp and never let standards drop. They made calls when we needed help with something and set things right quickly. A large part of the stay at the hotel being great is due to them. Thanks for upholding the image of Greek hospitality!In sum, it was excellent staying at Oia Suites.

Being a 15 minute walk into town is a bonus- it is less busy and much quieter. Breakfast each morning was served exactly when we ordered it and we could have had as little or as much as we wanted.

1024,"We arrived in Santorini from Paros as the final stop on our honeymoon. We arrived into the port and had arranged with the hotel for a pick up, who was there waiting for us when we arrived. Transfers to the port and airport are 35E and take about 30 minutes.On arrival at the hotel, we were greeted by Kostis and Marialou who gave us an overview of the island which was very helpful. We were blown away by our room which was by far the nicest of the three hotels we'd stayed in on our honeymoon. We had the room with the jacuzzi on the balcony and it was lovely, with a stunning view of the caldera.The hotel is very quiet and you will always get a bed around the pool. The highlight was breakfast being delivered to your room - you could order as much as you like and it was delicious. The breakfasts are made by the fabulous cleaner Aurelia who is absolutely lovely - please pass on how good we think she is! Kostis comes round when you're sunbathing to bring you ice cold water to your bed and, sometimes, a very welcome glass of wine. Kostis is the smiliest, most polite man you'll ever meet and he works so hard to make sure you're having a good stay. The hotel is about 10 mins walk to the start of Oia, but the views are stunning so it's never a chore. It's an easy walk too either along the road or the coastal path. After visiting Paros and Mykonos, we felt most safe walking along the road here as it was well lit and there is a foot path.Overall we would not hesitate to come back here. The rooms are beautiful, the views stunning and the staff are an asset to the company. Thank you for a lovely holiday!","August 26, 2017","20    Oia Suites

1025,"My wife and I booked Oia Suites for our honeymoon based on the online hotel pictures and reviews. What we found out when we arrived, however, was that what we reviewed did not fully capture the beauty of this place and the helpful staff. When we arrived, we were greeted by Maria and then by the amazing view of the Caldera. The hotel is about a 15 minute walk from Oia's Main Street. The hotel was close enough to head ""downtown"" for a lunch or dinner or a gelato, but far enough away to get away from all the busyness. The staff was wonderful. We were served breakfast, which is complimentary, every morning in our room or on our patio. The front desk was so helpful in planning our activities and also arranging transport to and from our ferry. (Tip: if you email them your itinerary they can arrange for your transportation to the suites when you arrive). Whenever my wife or I had a question about the island we would always go to the front desk and they would always have an answer. This place made our honeymoon so memorable and we are so thankful to Oia Suites for making it so. I recommend staying in the deluxe suites if you can. ","August 17, 2017","20    Oia Suites

1026,It will be hard to describe this magical holiday. We were referred to Oia Suites by an Aussie traveller and he was right.Ideally located just outside of the town Oia directly opposite the coolest Tavern you might find. That's another review. The buses stop just outside - BUT be warned they can be crowded. They are the cheapest way to move around tho. €1.8 to Oia - 10min€2.4 to Thira (Fira) - 30minThe view of the Caldera once we climbed to the top of hill is simply stunning. The pictures say it all.

She showed us to our room & explained everything we needed to know especially how to get to Oia on foot.We had booked directly with Oia Suites a ""Suite with Sea View"" & I truly think we got the one with the best direct view of the sea from our private patio, although slightly obstructed by the big balcony. If you can afford it, you may want to check out the Junior Suite & above categories because they are situated down the stairs & may offer better unobstructed views.The furnishings/colours were new, really nice & cosy, beds/pillows super comfy. There was a wall mounted foldable clothes drying rack right at the patio. Make sure you peg your clothes, the winds are strong here! Only 3 channels on the TV though.There was no kitchenette, but there were a kettle, coffee/tea/sugar, cups & a fully stocked mini fridge. It's not stated anywhere but do check with the staff, because the 1st big bottle of drinking water in the fridge is free.If I had to nitpick, it'll be the flooring/walls of the bathroom - too slippery when wet & takes very long to dry up. Also, no shower curtains...Breakfast was of high quality but portions on the small side. Make sure you indicate more pieces if you require bigger portions. When we had to check out earlier than the breakfast time of 8.30am, MAROULIA delivered some cold supplies the night before to our room. Super helpful & kind girl! She really aims to give the best service to guests!Oia Suites is in Finikia, a 15-20min walk to Oia. If the weather is fine, it's a pleasant stroll along the caldera (the same hiking path from Fira). If you choose the main road, be mindful of vehicles as the roads get narrow at some parts.During off season, there were hardly any restaurants open nearby. You'd hav to walk to Oia for food & groceries.Overall, really happy with our stay here!","April 20, 2017","20    Oia Suites

1035,"We just stayed at Oia Suites in October as a birthday present from my wife. The place is just stunning, very close to Oia; just a short walk. This is a very small hotel, really charming and with spectacular views over the caldera and the sunset. We had one of the nicest rooms, which I believe are number 6, 7 and 8. The suites are very nicely decorated.But what makes this place so special is definitely the service. From the moment we arrived, Effie and Elina were really helpful and friendly.The breakfast is taken to your room every morning; make sure you ask when filling the form as each element is one item, so if you want sausages, make sure you write how many.I had an amazing time and we were really lucky as the weather was beautiful despite being the end of the season.We had the swimming pool for ourselves and there are plenty of tabernas and charming restaurants around the hotel.I totally recommend this hotel for a romantic break or for a long holiday.","October 20, 2016","20    Oia Suites

We arrived at about 9am following a very early morning flight only to find that we had been upgraded from the superior to the deluxe suite, our room was already ready for us and we were served breakfast. The views from the hotel are superb and the pool is amazing. From what we have seen there are not too many hotels in Oia with such a large pool. The distance from Oia is perfect - an easy walk but you are away from the people and traffic of Oia. The hotel is so quiet and peaceful and the other guests have been the same. Please do not bring kids here or stay here if you are planning on having loud drinks on your balcony! All of the restaurant recommendations from the hotel staff have been spot on as well.

1040,Spent 10 days here in July. Only 8 rooms. Beautiful views from our terrace. Room was lovely - everything we needed. The most relaxing holiday we have ever had. No getting up early to get a sun bed. . Swimming pool area clean and quiet. Breakfast served promptly and was lovely. Great having a hot tub on the terrace! The staff could not have been nicer - so helpful and friendly and always with a smile - they went out of their way to make our stay so pleasurable. Definitely recommend the day trip catamaran trip with BBQ on board - not cheap but worth every penny. I would rate this hotel more than 10 out of 10 if that was possible. Make sure you book a room overlooking the Caldera though as a couple of the rooms didn't and I would have been very disappointed. Go for a Superior room.

1041,"PLEASE READ THIS REVIEW Absolutely amazing place HIGHLY RECOMMEND. First of all the hotel arranged for us to get picked up at the port. The driver was awesome and told us all about the island and what to eat, drink, and see. --Great outsource from Oia Suites. As soon as we arrived they greeted us with cold water and smiles. Gave us a sheet with a bunch of foods and drinks to select for breakfast! Explained to us the island and how it worked for 15 minutes! Took us to our room and we were breath taken. Amazing view, the pictures looked exactly like the room and the view. No photoshop! That was awesome to see. Anyways we stayed two nights and three days. Everywhere we needed to go they showed us the way on the map. Any restaurant we wanted to go( with their amazing recommendation) they booked for us. They told us where to eat and swim! Great recommendations once again. Fast track to our engagement. I asked Anna to help me with the room presentation. Many of you might think ""why on the balcony"" well.. Because it was romantic as hell and the view is killer. They put down colourful rose pedals, candles everywhere and a fantastic red wine! We were blown away with the customers service. -- Hard to find that in Greece just so you know. We give them 100000 out of 10. Not a complainant anywhere. We are super picky too. Room was so clean, every day. Every morning they cleaned the hot tub. GO HERE NO WHERE ELSE. ROOM NUMBER 8 was more privet then the most. Thank you Anna from Oia Suites. You and the staff were amazing!!! We might come back for our honey moon! Joanna and Dean Vozikas. ","August 19, 2016","20    Oia Suites

1042,"Oia Suites is a perfect place to stay. Everything was great from the incredible breakfast each day to the pool to the hot tub. Anna and Eleni handled anything you asked of them and would make dinner reservations and get you a table right on the edge overlooking the water. Fresh towels everyday that were nice and thick unlike most of the places in Europe I have stayed in. Air conditioning worked great, it's only a 10 minute walk in to town and you are away from the crowds which you will see once you are in town. Perfect Perfect Perfect.

1043,"From the moment our driver greeted us at the airport terminal, to sitting on our balcony right now enjoying the beautiful views of the caldera, this establishment has gone above and beyond our expectations. The staff is very attentive, and can almost anticipate your every thought or question before you can ask. Note that I did not use the word ""concern"", as you will have nothing to worry about during your stay.Breakfast served every morning to our personal balcony has been delicious. There is a wide variety of options to chose from, leaving you very satisfied. Want something altered slightly? Just say the word and they take care of it.As mentioned before, the views of the caldera and volcano are stunning. Watching the cruise ships in the sea below has become my new favorite quiet activity.The pool is crystal clear and the perfect temperature for the heat Santorini brings.There are very limited rooms at this establishment, leaving your privacy intact. We have been here for a few days now and have never felt impeded on by other guests or staff. A welcome concept to our honeymoon. Everything is meticulously cared for and very clean. The office staff has been very willing to set up excursions around the island (boating, snorkeling, dinner reservations, etc.), leaving us to just sit back and relax.My wife and I could not be more impressed. We will definitely be staying here for any future trips to Santorini!Cheers!Jason N","July 22, 2016","20    Oia Suites

The location is great if you want to be close to Oia but do not want to be right in Oia. It is a 10 minute walk to the town and the sea views are breathtaking. Very quiet and romantic.

1047,"Views to die for overlooking the caldera. 15 mins walk from centre of oia but I think that is ideal. Oia gets very busy especially at rush hour (7pm) when all the cruise ship coaches pile in so everyone can do the sunset thing (they are beautiful....That is the sunsets not the selfie stick wielding coachers). We had Junior suite which is on upper level which was lovely and with own hot tub but a little lacking in privacy outside as faces onto path to the pool so would recommend digging deep and choosing a deluxe suite if you do want a bit more privacy. We did however have drapes we could pull over a bit to protect from evening sun /for privacy. Cleaning team are amazing and rooms were scrubbed and spotless every day. Staff lovely and friendly and helpful whenever asked. Breakfast on balcony every day was lovely relaxed way to start the day. And they didn't mind how much you ordered so other half often ordered extra toastie or fruit to snack on later. Fridge facilities were ample to stash all your drinks etc that you get at shop (there is no bar or facilities on site for food /drink but that's is a small supermarket 5 mins walk away) . General atmosphere was of relaxed calm, very limited number of rooms (think about 8/10 in all) so quiet, loads of room around pool, often had to selves. Could have done with a few more coat hangers as we had 4 each for a week and this place is so clearly high end it was silly annoyance that could be easily addressed. Santorin Moy restaurant directly opposite is actually fine for When you can't be bothered to go into oia. Music is hilarious and food fine. Overall place is beautifully quiet so I'd say definitely not for families with kids or those hoping to meet and spend time with other guests (re weren't so it was perfect)!

1049,"We were glad to be moving away from Fira town (not the hotel, the actual town itself) and both excited to be moving to Oia.Arrived at the hotel via the pre arranged transfer, checkin was smooth, gave us a great description of the hotel & town and we moved to the pool as the room wasn't ready.Rooms are brilliant and we stayed in 2 different types. 1st room was a suite with a hot tub over looking the sea, WOW! Stunning modern decor inside, the view was breath taking and the hot tub was a nice extra. We then moved to a sea view suite, nice and comfortable but could do with an update inside as looked a little dated.Breakfast was great being served to your balcony every morning.Pool area was quiet and always free sun beds with a lovely breeze coming in from the sea.Location- 10-15 min walk in to the town, either down the back of the Hotel (wouldn't suggest this way if you're not steady on your feet or at night) or down the road in front of the hotel. The hotel provides a torch for the evenings.In front of the hotel there is a lovely Greek restaurant. For some reason the hotel don't recommend visiting but we went twice.

Breakfast being delivered to your balcony every morning was a great touch. My one and only gripe came to when we checked out. As with all my other travel plans, I had booked Oia Suites through booking.com. Despite having stated in the booking we would be paying cash, it was only when we came to check out and settle up our bill we were told our credit card had been charged. Very frustrating as I never use my credit card and had to then sort out changing back our currency (which we obviously lost money on) to then pay off my bill.

One negative is that upon inspection I found some hairs on the mattress cover, which I asked the housekeeper to change, and she did so. Other than that, breakfast was lovely - it is so cute that it's delivered to your door! Wifi is strong (that is important to us!) and the staff are so friendly. She gave us a mini history lesson on santorini and recommended places to go/things to see. It's only a 10 minute walk to oia along the path at the front of the hotel... Amazing views. It's nicer being that ""little bit"" further out as the hotels situated directly in Oia have no privacy - and lots of stairs! Would definitely recommend this hotel. Just be careful - it can be very slippy! Especially when the hot tub has been used.

Two only comments that I can add is that the breakfast is continental and could have been better fo how much you are paying a night specially when it is brought to the room because they don’t have room to have an area for breakfast. They don’t have that many rooms so cook to order or maybe have some eggs and ham would have been perfect. A hot breakfast will have made this place the best one. Second to add is that we paid for the private pool (jacuzzi) and it is not inside the room, is it not a private balcony as I thought, you have to walk through the balcony and next to the pool to go inside the room, so technically anyone can walk to it. I would have liked to have my own private in my balcony, I would not have paid extra for it because the pool of the villa is next to the stairs that take you to the room. Besides those two comments I will definitely come back. Amazing Caldera view...","June 7, 2018","21    Kima Villa

1067,"This is a hidden gem of a hotel in the middle of Oia. We booked the Superior Cave Suite and loved having our own private jacuzzi. We were also just a few steps away from the public pool. All rooms are fairly close together and I would see where some would have no privacy at all (especially the ones right next to the pool), so we were glad we booked the cave suite. The staff was wonderful and super helpful! They carried our bags up and down the steps when we checked in and checked out and that is a task! Tons of lot of steps! They would set up our breakfast every morning on our balcony, so we could dine with a view. THAT VIEW! What can I say, it was stunning! We also loved having a refrigerator in our room, and already stocked! The prices aren't bad either. There is a little general store up the steps on the main path that sells snacks, fruit and beverages. I believe they are open until 10 or 11pm. Very convenient! I miss this place already. We will definitely visit again and would highly recommend the hotel to anyone looking for a romantic, relaxing setting. A+ all around!","October 2, 2017","21    Kima Villa

1070,"We stayed here for 8 days for our honeymoon. We booked a superior cave suite. We had our own pool and area to relax in which was lovely. Breakfast is delivered with a smile and is yummy with pastries, fruit, juice, tea and coffee, cheese etc. Whilst the room we were in wasn't 100% private from guests, all the villas at Kima are more private than many other locations in that they are off the main pathways and there are no public passing by. The service is excellent with daily room service and evening candles. We even asked for a room fan so that we could turn off the air conditioning and they went out and bought one for us. The staff and excellent and made our stay really enjoyable. thank you.","July 27, 2017","21    Kima Villa

1071,"I cannot recommend Kima Villa enough. Starting with the service - we arranged a taxi to collect us from the port to the hotel through Kima Villa beforehand. It was €40 each way which we thought was expensive, but couldn't be bothered with the hassle of a bus or negotiating with transfers at the busy port. It took about 40 minutes from port to hotel. When we arrived near the hotel, Aris (I think that was his name) met us and took our luggage - he insisted on taking all 3 bags down to the steep steps. We had a very warm welcome arrival from Georgia and Aris. Our room wasn't ready when we arrived (it was about 11:30am and check in wasn't until much later) so Georgia made us drinks whilst explaining all the top sites of santorini. The room was ready shortly after we arrived and it was simply amazing. We were in a double deluxe room on the same level as the swimming pool. We were worried before we went that we wouldn't have a balcony facing out to see as the website said 'all suites have balconies' and we didn't book a suite. Whilst it wasn't a balcony exactly we had table and chairs in front of our room that looked out over the sea and pool, it was perfect. The room itself was beautiful, lovely decor, really cool climate, comfy bed, nice and dark at night. The bathroom was lovely too, with luxurious shampoo etc, white robes and slippers. There was a fridge and tea making facilities in each room, and we were given a small bottle of cava and plate of fruit on arrival which was a nice touch. The pool was perfect to cool down in after the santorini heat and the views were to die for. Aris and Saffa (not sure if that is her name!) kept the place immaculate, always so clean and well looked after and they were always very friendly, and couldn't do enough for us. The location was great - a steep climb to the top and there was a shop, restaurants etc. About 10 minutes walk to the sunset which was good as it meant it wasn't as busy at Kima Villas as it is further down the path. Breakfast was €15 each per day, which again wasn't cheap but each day it was different, tasty and fresh and I loved that you simply had to call them in the morning when you wanted breakfast and that brought it to your 'balcony'. Although it's not cheap to stay here, having looked at many, many options in Oia, I think the service, quality of the rooms and pool / location meant that overall it was good value in a very expensive destination! Would 100% recommend. ","July 24, 2017","21    Kima Villa

1072,"This is the first time I've been compelled to write a review - who has time, right?! The staff at Kima (Aris, Georgia, Saba) were hands down the friendliest and most accommodating folks I've come across in my extensive travels. When we arrived, after 20+ hours of travel, we were immediately greeted with refreshments and accommodations. As we were checking in the staff learned we were actually on our honeymoon and went above and beyond to quickly get together the most beautiful champagne and fruit spread! I was shocked they were able to pull something like that off in less than five minutes! Our room (deluxe double) was perfect for us. It had plenty of room for our luggage and activities. It was very hot while we were in Santorini and this was the only hotel (we hopped around a bit) we stayed in where the AC kept the room really cold and we actually had to turn the temperature up - it was an amazing problem to have :)The property has a limited number of rooms in comparison to other hotels, which allows for a much more personable experience. We met several other guests that we will likely stay in touch with for years to come! This was the only hotel that we actually spent more time at and around the pool vs. adventuring / exploring the island. It was extremely peaceful with beautiful views of yachts and boats coming into the port. We really enjoyed the breakfast, which was included with the stay - other places nickel and dimed us for a lackluster buffet. Georgianna would bring us fresh breakfast to our outdoor patio each morning, all we had to do was phone and tell her what time. We really liked this, as we didn't want to run around looking for a viable breakfast option each morning. Breakfast was usually a spread of fruit, breads, and a different ""main dish"" each morning. It included the best fresh orange juice I've had in years, as well as coffee and tea. Lastly, the staff really went above and beyond when I had a laundry emergency and the staff stayed late that evening (for FREE) to make sure my clothes were clean, as the closest spot to do laundry was in Fira. Keep in mind this is after working very hard, long hours. I've never had that level of service in the U.S. (I know we normally have laundry service but I can buy new clothes at that rate!). They arranged excellent transportation and restaurant recommendations (we wanted the hole in the wall, local places... not tourist traps!).Definitely give Kima a look when you come to visit Santorini /Oia!

1074,"The hotel was at a decent location for Oia. Most of the hotels in the region have amazing views, and Kima Villa had its share too. However, that is all it had to offer. Service staff was almost rude, and never smiled through our stay. Rooms were clean and renovated, but very average, looking worse than in pictures. We also had fleas in our room.They have a small pool, but there was no shade around the pool. No umbrellas were provided, while every other hotel we could see had shades around the pool. Hotel website clearly shows umbrellas near pool, and when we asked about it, they said they used to have it, but have removed them now. We couldn't use the pool for long due to that.Breakfast was a major letdown..one day they just had cheese and bread, and the other day we were served plain omelette with no veggies. We decided to stay out of the hotel as much as we can, and regretted paying up so much for a hotel like this.On day of departure, we asked the staff to book us a private transfer to the port. We were confirmed a pickup time, but at time of departure, the lady told us that we have to share the cab with another couple, who will make a stop at airport before us. On confronting her that we paid for a private transfer, she gave a lame excuse that our car broke down on the way. She asked us to pay in cash for the 'private' cab, so she could keep her cut I guess. At that point we had no other option as we would have missed our ferry, and she took full advantage of that. I would rather recommend staying at Fira, and coming to Oia for a daytrip. Oia had much better vibe in my opinion, and wasn't run amok with tourists.","June 20, 2017","21    Kima Villa

1078,"First, the good news. The view was spectacular. The homemade fig jam at breakfast was delicious. Staff was friendly and sweet, but some of the issues noted in what we didn't like made it seem like they weren't paying attention to some details. Watching Ari carry 3 loaded suitcases at a time on the staircase from the main street was impressive. And he came very early our last morning to carry our suitcases back up the stairs so we could get to the airport for an early flight. It was a relief to know that we had the pool available to dunk in to and refresh ourselves at the end of the day. So there were numerous things that made this an inviting place to stay.However, one out of 3 beds were unmade the first night with no available sheets to be found. The breakfast was not as sumptuous as in other places we stayed, but certainly adequate, although they did not remember after our 2nd day that we wanted no meat served. We noticed our neighbors would get hard-boiled eggs and fruit, while we would get either/or each morning. No effort was made to obtain something for a small breakfast the day before we left for our very early morning departure to the airport on our last morning, even though we asked 2 days in advance. If I were able, I would mark the ""overall rating of property"" and ""service"" rating each at 3.5, rather than 3 or 4. Wifi was inconsistent, but not unusual for Greece. We were in villa #1 which was designed for 3-4 people but felt smaller than we had expected for the cost and was a bit dank when we first arrived. The AC took care of the dankness, but initially it did not feel as welcoming as it might have.","September 17, 2016","21    Kima Villa

Ari who wears many hats, was most hospitable, carrying our 50 lb. suitcases down the steep walkway to reception with ease. He also carried them out when we left.

1080,"My friend and I had booked this hotel and had read the reviews on TripAdvisor. We spent quite a bit of money and understood that the cost was for the view as the location of the hotel is phenomenal. When we first arrived, the room we got was not what we expected, very old and dated and felt a bit unkept. Unfortunately for us, the entire villa is small so we could not move to another room. We felt a bit ripped off for what we paid, granted the views were amazing. Aside from the room, we must say though that the service was great. They helped us book our excursions and Ari was amazing - carrying all of our bags up and down those stairs. I think if they updated their rooms a bit, this property would be a five start rating on TripAdvisor.","July 19, 2016","21    Kima Villa

The staff is extremely friendly and helpful. They made us feel very comfortable and made sure we were happy any time there. Saba, the housekeeper, is a very very sweet and kind woman who proved us that they are still people passionated by their jobs. Everyone there is smily, efficient, nice... I aslo spent my birthday there and they made sure I would have the best birthday. My day was full of surprises thanks to them all and my boyfriend. I had a wonderful day. We stayed in the junior suite which is gorgeous!! From the inside first but also and surely with the terrasse with the private jaccuzi. Everything is clean, the view is outstanding, the place is very calm and most of all, very private (which is not the case of all properties in Oia because of the architecture).

We had the family suite, while the room was spacious enough the bathroom was dated and small and in great need of better ventilation. Once we used it a smell would ensue and just continue through the night until the next morning when the cleaning lady would tidy up. We would return and no smell. We stayed for 3 nights, kept the bathroom door closed and the exhaust fan on while we slept. At the price point of $350, certainly Kima Villas can make this better. Santorini does not seem to suffer from the economic woes of greece. On the other side, the staff were great. Always smiling and helpful. especially Aris. Breakfast outside of our room overlooking the water was something out of a book. You cannnot believe the beauty until you are there. My sons loved the pool but I had to caution them to be quiet as most the guest were couples just sunbathing. Location also was excellent.

1084,"We stayed at Kima villas in early June 2016 and found it rather pleasant. Being in the heart of Oia, villas in the summer are notoriously expensive and having booked only last minute, we picked Kima based on the reviews here on TA. I would say this is more like a B&B with a wicked view from its infinity pool, definitely not luxurious nor the most private but pleasant enough especially if you're out and exploring Oia most the day. We got the junior suite with a private jacuzzi which was worth the money especially when the pool was crowded with no deck chairs available.

This also gave us a private balcony and jacuzzi which were very well utilised.Tasos as always provided us with the names of restaurants and we would heartily recommend Melitini's, Kastro and Pelakanos, the latter of which gives fantastic views of the fantastic sunsets which grace Santorini. If you are wandering around Oia, then you could do far worse than stop off at Meteor Bar for a cocktail or fresh juice, whilst listening to some jazz!!Kima Villas is a wonderful little hotel, the team are courteous and are proud of their work place, the area is kept spotless by the tireless work of Saba and Aris, and we just love the place......","September 15, 2015","21    Kima Villa

1088,"Book this hotel. Now. Actually, don't book it, just in case I want your room instead! Haha. But seriously, book it. The location is incredible. Oia is the place to stay- far away from the cruise ship tourists. The streets are made of marble, and the hotel is very close to lots of excellent restaurants and shopping. View is TO. DIE. FOR. Amazing. Stunning. I heard a lot of people mentioning that the pool was small, but honestly, it's just the right size. You can't have a huge pool on a cliffside, and this one is far from small. The view from inside the pool is amazing. I spent hours just lounging in and around the pool. Ask Tasos to bring you some wine!The bed was hard, but that's okay. I also liked being in a cave room, although the wifi didn't really work inside my room. But it worked well outside by the pool. The rooms are super quiet which was great. The shower in our room was dated but I honestly didn't care. Breakfast wasn't worth the 20 euros unless you're not wanting to trek up and down the stairs. The stair. Oh, the stairs. It was 70 VERY LARGE steps down (and back up) to the villas. It definitely made us plan our outings wisely. The one time we forgot sunscreen and had to go back for it was enough to make us more cautious the next time. But, I'm not in the best physical shape and I could tackle them by stopping to catch my breath halfway up. Make sure to tip the guy who brings your suitcases up and down! Tasos was amazing and incredibly helpful. We booked our excursions through him as well as reservations for dinner and everything went off without a hitch every time. It was seriously flawless. He was able to accommodate our needs perfectly. I definitely recommend this hotel. Just make sure to leave plenty of time to relax by the pool! ","September 10, 2015","21    Kima Villa

You do not have to go very far or you do not have to walk so far down to the hotel...but do not worry they had a man waiting for me at the top to bring my bags down.

1091,"My wife and I vacationed for the first time in Greece. We struggled with Fira vs Oia,and which hotel to book. After we landed in Santorini,and was wisked away from the airport to Kyma Villas,we were immediately impressed and happy with our decision. Tasos and his staff handled EVERYTHING! From carrying our bags up and down stairs,to making dinner reservations,to the awesome breakfast each morning,to printing boarding passes,etc! The views from our Junior Suite was fantastic! To see my wife's smile each morning was worth the trip. The hotel was clean and very affordable. Would stay here again in a heartbeat.","July 27, 2015","21    Kima Villa

1092,"My 5 night stay at Kima Villa was everything I was hoping it to be! Actually , it surpassed all of my expectations!!! The location in Oia was great (60 steps down = 60 steps up) which was quite doable for me...the facilities and the pool were superb!! The staff was excellent! A huge thank you to Saba, Tasos & Aris for making my stay so enjoyable.!! Also, I want to recognize the taxi driver for Kima, Marcos for waiting for me at the port when my 9pm ferry from Milos did not arrive until 1:30am!! Bravo Marcos!!","July 20, 2015","21    Kima Villa

1093,"After a full-on 4 weeks of touring in Europe, we treated ourselves to 3 nights on Santorini. We didn't think that Oia was going to be affordable (it certainly wasn't 10 years ago), but we found Kima Villas that were great value for money and in a fantastic location right on the cliff. And we were not disappointed! It was wonderful. The views were breathtaking, the atmosphere intimate and welcoming. Tasos and his small team were really helpful and friendly. So it isn't a luxurious resort, but it is charming, clean, has a lovely little pool, a great breakfast on your terrace and is in an ideal spot. We loved our time there and would go back in a heartbeat. ","July 15, 2015","21    Kima Villa

1094,"We spent an amazing 4 days in Oia at Kima Villas and we had the most blissful experience. We stayed in the Superior Cave Suite, which is very spacious with private balcony and secluded jacuzzi (not heated) and the most stunning views I have ever seen. The staff (Tasos, Aris and Saba) were so accommodating, hardworking and friendly, I cannot tell you how pleasant our experience was with this staff. The daily breakfast was simple, but tasty and served on our balcony! The newly renovated Superior Cave Suite is sleek, modern, clean, roomy and met all of our needs, except the bed mattress is uncomfortable/rock hard. The hotel is situated in a very quiet location with excellent access to the local market, restaurants and shops. There are a lot of steps so beware if you have any mobility issues as it's a hike but not a problem for us, and in fact we welcomed it after a lot of delicious meals and wine! Also the staff carries your luggage so no worries there. :) Amazing value and truly stunning location for the money! You will not be sorry booking this Suite, even if the bed is hard, everything else is ethereal! Thank you Kima for a dream vacation!","July 8, 2015","21    Kima Villa

1095,"Just returned from a blissful week in Oia and must say that I found this hotel and it's wonderful staff to be near perfect! Junior suites with the private balcony and jacuzzi were perfectly situated to offer privacy and some of the finest views on the planet. The staff (Tasos, Aris and Saba) were some of the warmest, most accommodating people I've ever met, all this in the face of serious Greek economic upheaval! As a former Four Seasons alumn, I can tell you that I have met many hotel employees......hire for attitude, and you can train for the rest! Tasos (hotel manager) sent us to some amazing restaurants (Floga and Meletini were our favorites!!) The daily breakfast was simple, but amazing! The newly renovated Junior suites are sleek and very comfortable, and the hotel was situated in a very quiet (by Santorini standards) location with excellent access to restaurants and shops. My only criticism is that at 6'2 (and built like a linebacker) the mattress was a bit uncomfortable for my large frame, but I still managed to sleep more than at home, and returned well rested and recharged.Thank you Kima for a wonderful vacation!","July 6, 2015","21    Kima Villa

The pool was nice just to cool off and the service and friendliness of the staff was good and having breakfast on your balcony everyday was amazing. The steep steps would be difficult for the immobile to access the villa up and down all the time. The Wifi wasn't that great for the kids and even though the villa was nice and quaint, it was very compact with all four of us in there. The bathroom was tiny and just a shower and we had to hold the shower which was a pain! We enjoyed the whole of Oia and this was our fifth time to Santorini so we know it well. The villas were pleasant and the view was to die for!! Well worth a stay for the view, but you won't see the sunset directly from your balcony, but a walk away you will.","January 22, 2015","21    Kima Villa

And then there's the sunsets, it just keeps getting better....The Villa itself is spotless and has a lovely infinity pool, where you can simply watch the world go by and unwind...very very relaxing.

1101,"The location of Kima Villa is perfect. It is on the edge of the cliff over looking the sea. The views are like a postcard. To get to the Villa you must walk down stairs which is your daily exercise. Your bags will be carried down when you enter and up when you leave. The two things that make it amazing are the pool and the local market right up the stairs from the villa. You will not want to leave the pool. The only thing is that you must wake up early to save seats around the pool because there is not enough for everyone who stays in the villa. We used the market everyday too. We would go for snacks and drinks to bring back to the pool. The villa does not have a bar, which is not necessary. The manage was awesome. He helped us with anything we needed and so friendly. All the staff were friendly and helpful!The rooms are simple and clean. They have a refrigerator and kitchenette with all the necessary things provided you would need. Many times we would again go to the market or bakery and eat lunch right outside our room. You can get a continental breakfast serviced on the table outside your door every morning for 10 euros per person. We had a room on the second floor which was nice because it was more private then the rooms right around the pool.Overall an amazing experience.

1102,"I shared a room with my sister and I was a little disappointed with our room when we first arrived. It only has queen bed which cannot be separated. The rooms are quite basic, with a small kitchen (we never used except to make a cuppa) with a small table, bench seat and couple of chairs. The furniture and room decor is dated but clean. However in all honesty, we didn't spend much time in the the room so it was acceptable. Service was a bit hit and miss. We asked for ice and got about 10 cubes with the message theres no more which is fine, just dont expect service of an upmarket hotel. The swimming pool was a good size for the small hotel (I think there were 9 rooms). Its crystal clear blue water was amazing and we loved just hanging there and staring out watching the cruise ships go by. Obviously Its the location and views are what you are paying for. I initially thought it was quite expensive but we were on a tight budget. I would expect all accommodation in Oia to be very, very expensive with good reason. This hotel is an good option for anyone on a budget.","August 6, 2014","21    Kima Villa

If you have a car there is a free car park 100 meters from the hotel, or if you are lucky you can find a car parks at the front of the hotel.The staff are very friendly and welcoming and offered suggestions of things to do around the island. We had a very large room with small balcony opening out to the pool area. The bathroom was a good size but the water temperature seemed to turn hot and warm throughout my shower.One negative point is that the walls were very thin. There were a group of girls in the room next door and they had returned to the hotel past midnight on the first night we stayed. They were talking loudly and it woke me up. My husband had to get out of bed and ask the front desk to do something about the noise. Thankfully the staff member was understanding that it was very late and made a phone call to the group. The hotel is in a quiet area, but there were some dogs in the neighbouring properties and a few stray dogs around the area and at night we could hear them barking at times during the night.Breakfast is very basic and not too much not food selection.

1124,"Stayed here for several nights during a stay on Santorini with my wife. The location of this hotel is excellent; only a couple of hundred meetings from the local bus station and main centre of Thira, and therefore walking distance to restaurants and the amazing views of the Caldera. We stayed in a triple room where there was a small single 'sofa style' bed in a small living area downstairs, with a small double bed upstairs in the dome room. The bathroom looks recently renovated; however, the shower was terrible! It constantly fluctuated between boiling hot and cold water, with little consistency in water temperature. It made showering unpleasant after a long day exploring the sights of the island. The other major disappointment was the location of the double bed upstairs. First, the staircase to the upper level is at about 110 degrees so steep on the ascent and decent; this made coming down during the middle of the night to use the bathroom difficult and almost dangerous. If you have bees knees you might want to ask to avoid such a room. Second, being situated upstairs meant that it was like a sauna up there! With no air conditioning - only a fan that blew around hot air - it made for sweaty sleeping each night. Finally, the bed was rock hard and therefore difficulty to sleep on. A nice shower and bed are my two main priorities for hotel accommodation so it missed the mark majorly on these features. In saying that, the two ladies at reception were super friendly and helpful in helping us navigate the island, etc. The buffet breakfast was ok too, with a range of savoury (eg, eggs, bacon, cold meats) and sweets (eg, croissants, local pastries). Overall, worth it for the location but terrible for the room features. ","July 24, 2017","22    Anamnesis City Spa Hotel

1125,"I honestly don't know how anyone could have anything negative to say about this hotel- especially for the price! My husband and I had the luxury of staying here for two nights during our stay in Fira, Santorini. I'll review the room, breakfast, staff, and location in that order:Room: We stayed in a standard King bed room. It was perfect for two people, with a small balcony included. The plus to this room was the ample bathroom, and the fact that I got the see the most beautiful SUNRISE from our tiny balcony! I know Santorini is known for its sunsets, but have you seen the sunrise? WOW!Breakfast: Breakfast was buffet-style with your staples available- breads, cereals, pastries, juice, coffee, sausages, bacon, and eggs to order. We left each morning satiated.Staff: the ladies working the front desk as well as the cleaning staff were so accommodating. We received help with our port-to-hotel transfer, and were accommodated for our late check out. There is a gentlemen who sits at the front desk at night so safety is clearly important.Location: This hotel is situated walking distance to everything you could possibly need. 5 minute walk to Fira center, 10 minute walk to the start trail from Fira to Oia, and 5 minute walk to the local bus station which provides transportation to the new Port, Oia, and other parts of Santorini. If I ever visit Santorini again, I would love to stay here again!","July 19, 2017","22    Anamnesis City Spa Hotel

1126,"We had a very enjoyable stay here - the hotel is modern and well kept. The location is perfect, only a 5 minute stroll into Fira centre. The staff are excellent - our driver for our transfer didn't show up due to our ferry being delayed by over an hour so the hotel refunded us the money from our alternative arrangement.

1127,"Lovely little B&B. Had an amazing room with jetted tub on balcony on top floor, with sun loungers and towels. (As in previous reviews the hot tub is not hot,it's warm but when the weather hot you don't need it that warm)Such an amazing view. Very private not overlooked. Each day we would sit in jacuzzi and look at that view. View is of sunrise. Breakfast very filling. Owner very informative and help us book transport and excursions. Hotel was quiet the week we were there. Room had a lovely big bathroom . In room fridge with kettle, coffee maker, sandwich press. If you need anything extra like coffee mugs or bottle opener, all you have to do is ask. In room safe which is key lock. We got hotel to arrange airport transport €20 per couple. We had room 13 would definitely book this room again. You can see donkeys walk past in morning and evening. Only 5min walk to main square. We bought a hiking map to explore the island by foot and by ATV. We booked via Expedia so flight were with easy jet from Gatwick. When we left santorini I was glad we didn't have hold bags and with a travel agent. as they make you que up outside for ages. We just walk straight to security.

1132,"This was an absolutely lovely stay! The staff went above and beyond to completely cater to the guests and are extremely friendy! We didnt bump into one person who wasnt extremely enthusiastic and welcoming! They are there to help with anything you need big or small! We ended up having an issue with a Ferry Company cancelling a Ferry we had booked to Crete without any previous warning...which could have potentially been very stressful, however,  the lady at the Front Desk offered to help us out and was able to sort everything out for us with the Ferry Company in Greek which was a huge stress reliever as we did not have to deal with it ourselves or waste precious holiday time! You can book a variety of wonderful excursions for a good price at the reception! We would definitely recommend their Thirasia Island/Volcano/Hotsprings Day tour for a mere €26. They will also, book taxis, hire cars, print flight and ferry tickets, lend extra towels, provide chargers and converters...anything you need!The breakfast was fantastic! Lots of very healthy and local options! Greek Yogurt with Honey and Walnuts, lots of delicious pastries, meats, fruits, etc. to choose from! You will not go hungry! If you open the door in the breakfast room in the morning you can watch the donkeys get herded by in groups! Excellent!The resort is a comfortable 5 minute walk off the main strip which means it is very quiet and peaceful but still right beside all the action! You can get a beautiful view of the sea from your room but it is not the classic caldera view....but well worth it for the solitude. The only thing I was a bit disappointed with was that our private Hot Tub on the balcony was luke warm at 34/35 degrees... not hot. I can see how this would be perfect during the summer...but as we stayed in off season so we wished it was able to get hotter so we couldve made better use of it as the outdoor space is spectacular. The room itself was massive and everything else was beyond what we expected so we really cant complain!One of the best holidays I have ever been on!

1138,"As a rule, you cannot go wrong with Santorini, I suppose this can be said for many of the Greek Islands, so how then does one distinguish one hotel from the other, when everything on this island is basked in calm and serenity?. This review will not provide the answer to that, but it can shed light on the Anamnesis City Spa Hotel. The Anamnesis is smack dab in the middle of city centre Fira; it is close to the high street but still cocooned in its own time zone, so the activity of the city never really crashes in; with balconies looking the gentle calm of the far off Aegean. The staff are friendly and eager to help, as are the rooms, which cozy and neat will remind you more of an inn than a hotel- but that is the takeaway, Santorini doesn't do grandeur or spectacle, they leave that to the island itself, and once you come to this realization, you are able to allow the Island wash over you. I spent three nights in May 2016, for a total of 255 EUR, half board and room. I will have very fond memories of this time, and that is in no small part due to the warm reception and the lasting memories of the Anamnesis. Sadly i didn't have time to use all their facilities, like the spa, but when next I find myself in Santorini, I will be making myself their guest again, and that for me is the biggest endorsement I can give any hotel.","August 5, 2016","22    Anamnesis City Spa Hotel

1139,"This was a total surprise and joy. We arrived by foot on a busy road just along from the bus station. We found the hotel next to the kerb, so thought it would be noisy, it wasn’t. It was an oasis of calm when we entered. The receptionist welcomed us and went through the islands highlight with us, always helpful. She then advised we had breakfast included and they had even given us a free upgrade! Awesome!We had a gorgeous room with a massive balcony looking over the coast, they even apologised it wasn’t over the caldera. The caldera side of Thira is very windy so we didn’t mind a bit. We felt safe and secure, with a safe in the room and privacy from the street.Then joy of joy we got a jacuzzi all of our own, clean, warm and for our exclusive use. Breakfast was lovely, with a large choice of fresh fruit, bread, meat cheese etc. Handy little shop across the street, bike hire up the road. Short walk to the bars and restaurants.The pool was small but clean and pleasant to swim in. We asked about restaurants and were given a great recommendation too. We didn’t have time to use the steam room or treatments but can’t say enough good things about this little hotel.","July 8, 2016","22    Anamnesis City Spa Hotel

The facilities were spotless and the staff were so friendly and helpful. On my birthday, they left a bottle of wine and a lovely note for me. Also they printed off maps without being asked and were very knowledgable about the island.If you can get a room with a terrace and hot tub, then I think it's worth the extra money.

1144,"Me and my boyfriend stayed here in June this year , the hotel itslef was really modern as it has just been refurbished and is in a great location literally a couple of minutes walk to the caldera. There was enough to eat at breakfast but it was quite simple The swimming pool was lovely and would of been relaxing however there was a lot of road noise as it is next to a very busy road leading into fira centre with numerous quads, mopeds and vehicles. The room we stayed in was a jacuzzi room , before we arrived at the hotel I emailed them 3 times asking if we could have the room with the larger balcony as this and sunloungers on and the other one was a lot smaller. I finally got a response stating that the room we would recieve would have sunloungers, however when we arrived we where given the room with the smaller balcony and the jacuzzi was In full view of the main road. The lady did offer to put sunloungers on the balcony however it would have been to much of a squeeze with them on there. The jacuzzi itself was always full of debris, bugs and was freezing so we couldn't use it until on our 5th day when they decided to clean it and turn the temperature up, however they failed to mention not to use it for a couple of hours as there was bleach in there which ruined my boyfriends shorts, they did clean it agin the next day and told us not to get in straight away but it was to late by then. when we were checking out of the hotel they also charged us 50 euro as I had got makeup on one of the bedsheets only a little bit but they couldn't get it out , there was also marks on some of the towels which again they said they couldn't get out (this was the bleach from the jacuzzi ) I was extremely unhappy with this as we had already payed a lot for a jacuzzi room however they weren't interested. Overall the hotel was ok , but make sure you use your own towels or don't get any marks on theirs !","August 26, 2015","22    Anamnesis City Spa Hotel

The hotel is about a 5 minute walk from Fira Square and is absolutely lovely. The hotel staff are wonderful and really added to the trip. The rooms were very nice, and very clean. Our patio was excellent. The breakfast was very good and the pool is great. The hotel has plenty of areas for lounging around and relaxing. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the beds were a lot more firm than I would have liked them to be. Also, it is not a spa hotel. I booked thinking I might want to get a massage there and they don't offer any kinds of spa services.I would highly recommend Anamnesis and I would probably stay there again if I had any interest in returning to Santorini (which I don't).One tip: Despite being on a busy street, this hotel was difficult to find. No one seemed to know where it is and there are no street signs in Fira so the address wasn't helpful. My suggestion is to look on a map before you go because no one will be able to help you find the place.","October 28, 2014","22    Anamnesis City Spa Hotel

1155,"This cute little hotel couldn't have been more perfect for our trip to Greece! After a month in Rhodes and Athens, my boyfriend and I stayed for 3 nights in Santorini. We pulled up to Anamnesis and were wow-ed by the clean, beautiful hotel in comparison to others on the island. Our room looked just like the pictures (which can be a risk at other places we have found) and the free breakfast is AWESOME! Cheers for unlimited Greek Yogurt!As a surprise we were told a breakfast we had been upgraded to the jacuzzi suite for free!!! A huge room with a living room, an enormous view, and total privacy awaited us! Instead of going out to dinner we were more than happy staying in with olives, meat, wine and figs from the local mini mart (the shop keeper let us sample EVERYTHING). On top of everything the staff was really lovely. We asked a million questions and got a million answers on how to get to the bus, where to get dinner, where to walk, where to tour, and we're always met with wonderful options, great prices, and enthusiasm.Long story short... If I was staying in Santorini again... I would stay here in 5 seconds flat.","July 30, 2014","22    Anamnesis City Spa Hotel

1158,"To the Orabel Team,Firstly, thank you so much for the most amazing 10 days at your hotel.From the minute we arrived to the minute we left everything was perfect and nothing was ever too much to ask! We didn’t know what to expect from booking a boutique hotel after only ever staying at big hotels, but now after staying at the Orabel suites we felt like part of the family as they treated us as one of their own.Special mention to Jannis, Spiros, Sofia and Thalia who made our stay extra special by always going that extra mile. The bar tender Spiros always puts a smile on your face and is the best cocktail maker on the island! Jannis and Sofia always there to help with any questions and make your stay the best it can be, by recommending the best restaurants and activities to do in Santorini. Finally, Thalia the chef makes the most incredible hotel breakfast you will ever have, all the ingredients are grown within the hotel garden and taste extremely fresh! Her homemade cheesecake, cakes and pancakes are delicious!Honestly, this hotel is the best hotel we’ve ever stayed in. We will 100% be back in the future otherwise we’d miss the team too much! We can promise that if you book this hotel you won’t regret it! Thank you once again for giving us the most amazing holiday. Love Ellie & Sean x","June 27, 2019","23    Orabel Suites Santorini

1159,"My wife and I have just spent 7 nights at Orabel Suites in the South of Santorini staying in the ground floor suite called Nykritori.The hotel is set back from the 6km stretch of black sand beach in Perivolos, around a 3 or 4 minute walk with a mini mart on the way.The hotel has 11 suites in total all of which face out to a spectacular and luxurious pool and bar setting with the first floor rooms having a sea view.Spyros (apologies if misspelt) manages the bar and pool area in the afternoon and evenings and he really made our stay feel special. Everything from cocktail making, advice on the island, to interesting polite conversations at the bar, he really does everything and anything to make your stay here even more enjoyable, a real asset to this hotel.Upon arrival the owner jannis was just as accommotading and gave us lots of friendly advice about where to go during our stay, nothing is too much trouble and the whole team were incredibly friendly and genuine. Our room was very spacious and luxirious with a king sized bed, wardrobe, cupboard, chest of draws, two chairs, a couch, a beautiful shower room, tv, air conditioning, in room fridge, sink and coffee machine with mugs and cups provided.The team provide you with maps and all the information you need to get the most from your stay. Outside there is a generous seating area and extra large stone/ceramic hot tub/jacuzzi.Everything inside and out is made from high quality materials and the whole hotel has a high premium feel to it, fully deserving of 5 star status.On our first day we were met by the Head chef who asked us what we like to eat. Breakfast is then delivered to your room or in the pool area when each morning you call jannis and specify what you'd like to drink with breakfast shortly delivered afterwards. You can call for your breakfast any time i think between 9am and 3pm. Breakfast is 3 courses everyday and includes bread, jams, yoghurt, cereal, orange juice and water. Then you are delivered a hot meal by the head chef which is different everyday and can be tailored to your liking. It's then finished with a cold dessert such as fresh cheese cake. A lot of the food is made with fresh ingredients grown on site. This was so personal and a key selling point for this hotel and is all included.Location wise you have a strip of varying restaurants along the beach, it is close to lots of attractions such as red beach, faros lighthouse, pyros Town and other various spots for sightseeing, food and drink. The capital fira is around 30 minutes drive a way and the popular oiya is around 40 minutes drive away. The hotel is a 20 minute drive from the airport. Perivolos is one of the quieter and perhaps more couple focused locations on the island but everything is a short drive away, renting a car is highly recommended as there is so much to see. Driving from one end of the island to the other only takes around 45 minutes.Weather in early June was very hot from early morning to late afternoon, some days it can be windy but this is welcome in the heat. I'd say during the 7 days it probably averaged around 30 degrees Celsius.Drinks whilst only slightly on the expensive side were always served with nibbles and a smile from Spyros. A bottle of beer is 5 euros and a cocktail is 12 euros. There are more premium options for drinks in the 15 - 20 euros range. We did buy drinks from the supermarket, around 4 euros for 6 cans of beer and the staff did not seem to mind us drinking our own drinks in our room and outside area but perhaps a little rude to sit up at the pool with your own bottle of wine so we avoided doing so and kept our own drinks to our room area.There is no restaurant but you can order snacks such as a burger up to 5pm each day. The burger and all of the food is excellent and not too expensive. I could go on and on about the hotel but would like to end by saying thank you to Jannis and his team you all really do make this beautiful hotel something special and we will be back!","June 13, 2019","23    Orabel Suites Santorini

1165,"Myself and my boyfriend stayed here for 6 days in April. The hotel was absolutely incredible. Amazing breakfast every day, which you could have at any time during the day. Having our own hot tub was a high for us. All the staff (particularly Iannis, Spirios at the bar & Sofia from reception) were lovely warm people always more than willing to help in any way possible.We visited Oia for a day and Santo Wines (as recommended by Hotel staff) and had a great time at both. The hotel is a 7 minute walk to the beach down 1 road (although there’s no street lighting). At the beach there’s plenty of lovely restaurants. The hotel were always happy to book taxis for us but recommend hiring a car as it’s cheaper overall.We are hoping to return next year. ","April 27, 2019","23    Orabel Suites Santorini

Magda is an absolute legend and made our stay fun and enjoyable. She anticipated our every need and worked tirelessly to ensure our stay was the best it could be. She made us feel like family - we love her!Fourthly - Haris...words cannot describe his ability to make us the perfect drink, for each moment. We never ordered anything specifically, we just asked him for a drink and he whipped us up something great every time.

1167,"We stayed at the Orabel Suites at the start of October. Even before we arrived, they got in contact to arrange transportation to their hotel and it all ran so smoothly!On arrival, they kindly upgraded us to the honeymoon suite (which was AMAZING!).They cater to all of your needs and make your stay very comfortable.Pool area: so nicely laid out, great sun beds and the bar service is amazing, bringing drinks over.Room: fantastic, the terrace was amazing and so relaxing to eat breakfast on there. The bed was really comfy and the indoor jacuzzi was perfect!Food: We ate the breakfast on our balcony and the effort that goes into the breakfast is amazing and they change the hot dish daily which keeps the breakfast exciting. We ate at the pool once (Greek salad and club sandwich) both delicious and reasonably priced. I also have a nut allergy, which Janis made a note of at the start of the holiday and they were very careful with all my meals which put me at ease and never felt worried!Local area/excurcions: when we arrived Janis explained where we should go on the map and how to get there, which was really useful and we then felt we knew exactly where we wanted to go! He also organised car hire for us which was so easy as they dropped the car off at the hotel and could even drop the car off at the airport when we left - how convenient!Overall, one of the most amazing hotels I’ve stayed in. I will definitely be visiting again and for longer!! The hotel building is amazing and so beautiful, love the attention to detail. Every single one of the staff that work there are lovely and really made my holiday!Thanks for a great end to my holiday - wonderful hotel.","October 14, 2018","23    Orabel Suites Santorini

Magda is so lovely and helped us with booking an ATV one day and exploring a few small towns close by. Bar tender and chef are the kindest people and the food and drinks are delicious! Lots of really great places to eat in a 5-10 min walk to the beach front. We didn’t end up renting a car and we were fine walking to dinner, taking the bus to Oia one day and also ATV one day to Exo Gonia. It is in a quiet area so be ready to relax!!

It’s the first time I’ve not wanted to go home! The hotel and suites are beautiful. It is spotlessly clean and immaculate. The suites are a home from home and have everything you need and are extremely comfortable. The people running the hotel are the most friendly, lovely, helpful people you will ever come across. They will go to the ends of the earth to help you and will get you anything you desire. When you want breakfast you call reception and within minutes a tray arrives with an array of drink and food. Shortly after this the chef arrives and brings you a cooked item and a dessert! The food was delicious and we found that it kept us going all day! You could call up for breakfast even late into the afternoon! The hotel is located about 5/10 minutes walk from the beach. There are bars and restaurants all along the beach and the service and food there was also excellent. There is a mini supermarket just a few minutes walk away that has a very good selection of things and not expensive. You have a fridge and kitchen area in your suite to store things you may buy and tea and coffee making facilities. The hotel is situated in a quieter part of Santorini but after having a day out to Thira and Oia we couldn’t wait to get back to this little oasis of calm and tranquility.

The atmosphere of the whole place is always really peaceful and serene, and staff were excellent. You can have your breakfast served any time you want, just from calling from your room, and we had ours on our veranda each morning. Everywhere in the hotel is spotlessly clean and you are made to feel as though you can ask for anything you need.

Koula and Nikoletta prepared our room beautifully each day and made sure we were comfortable. Ioannis, the owner, has curated a wonderful staff that is always happy to help and serve you in any way. The hotel itself is so peaceful and quiet. The only sounds we heard were the pool water running and friendly ""hellos.""

Unlike most hotels where you check-in, stay, then check-out with hardly a word to the staff, here they treat you like an honored guest.

The hotel also has a deal with one of the restaurants on Perivolos beach so guests at Orabel Suites can use their beach equipment free of charge.The breakfast is excellent and they deliver it to your room or by the pool. The drinks are outstanding. The A/C gets nice and cold, the default temperature of the hot tub is just warm enough to feel relaxing without overwhelming you since Santorini does get pretty hot. The hotel is close to the beach and a bit of a walk away from a bus stop, but easy to get there by ATV. There's no other buildings nearby it so you're at your own quiet, relaxing slice of heaven. I could sit all day by the pool drinking there.A bit costly, but for the room you get, and the best hotel service I have ever had, it is well worth it and I intend to come back here in the future.","July 24, 2018","23    Orabel Suites Santorini

1180,"Wow, wow, wow ! The photos with the Tripadvisor reviews speak for themselves. This place is stunning : amazing views of the pool, hills and sea beyond. Rooms are spaciously huge, immaculate and very comfortable. We had a great nights sleep every night during our four nights here as the location is peaceful and quiet. We went for an hour's walk every morning before breakfast as the beach and the little road that runs along side it with restaurants is only a short distance away. Breakfast itself was delicious with something different every day. You can eat it down at the poolside or on your own little balcony and at whatever time you want - even well into the afternoon - how many places offer that level of service !!! Considering the prices that some of the other hotels and accommodation providers on the island charge, this place is such good value and yet nothing and I mean nothing is compromised. Yes, it is not in Oia or Fira where I originally was trying to book but to be totally honest, that was not an issue and for two reasons and this next bit is really important : we hired a car which meant that we could be in Fira in about 20 minutes and Oia about 40 minutes not to mention all the other little hidden gems that we were able to get to. If you are going in the height of the season though then those times may take longer due to the sheer number of tourists on the island and the traffic problems that this entails - I can only imagine that nightmare ! The second reason is the 'goldfish' syndrome. If you book somewhere in Fira or Oia and pay a hefty price for the privilidge, then don't expect total relaxation and privacy as you are stared at and overlooked by the number of people trekking and wandering about. Not only are there the tourists who are staying on the island but imagine 8 cruise boats in with around an average of two thousand people each, constantly wandering up and down past you all the time whilst you try to sunbathe and have some quiet, 'me time'. This won't happen at the Orabel Suites !!! You can have the best of both worlds here - peace, quiet and privacy and still be in midst of it all in less than an hour. This island is beautiful and nothing is too far away so do yourself a favour and book here - you won't regret it - enjoy !","May 21, 2018","23    Orabel Suites Santorini

Magda from reception is simply the happiest and kindest host, always looking after us. Thalia, the chef, surprises you with special breakfasts every day and she puts so much love into them! She made a dessert which my mum loved and she then gave her the recepy and translate it in our language for ease and left it in our room - details like this stay with you for ever.

The staff were welcoming and knowledgable giving us all the information we needed about the area on arrival, with complimentary drinks.They gave us information on hiring a car, atv, motorbikes and the bus information. They also informed us were we could get free sun beds by the beach and recommended some places to eat. The room were very spacious and clean with air conditioning and heating great for all weathers. Jacuzzi outside with privacy curtains. Breakfast was good with great healthy options and incredibly filling served on the patio every morning. The pool is great with sun beds all around and a bar.

Breakfast is great and the rooms are spacious, each with their own private terrace with hot tub. We visited 22-29 October, which meant that a lot of the more local restaurants had closed for Winter already.

1192,"Staying here has compelled me to write my first ever hotel trip review! I am fortunate enough to travel frequently and this hotel is as close to perfection as I have experienced. They have just got it so right! We stayed at two other top quality hotels on this Greece holiday but Orabel Suites won hands down. It's hard to put your finger on what stands this above the rest - but I'll try! It is just simply in a different league of experience: exceptionally personal, respectful, helpful and attentive service from Yannis and his small devoted team - compared to other hotels, this factor alone was tangible and made such a difference; incredible architecture, interior/exterior design and romantic lighting; the personal breakfast deliveries to your room/balcony, not to mention the top quality breakfast itself; the beautiful room with mezzanine sleeping area and private hot tub on the balcony complete with privacy curtains; the relaxing pool and bar area; or the general peace and tranquility of the hotel.

1193,"We stumbled upon Orabel Suites whilst looking through Trip Advisor last year. At that time there were approximately 70 reviews, all of which were outstanding. Could it really be that good ? ""Yes it could and more"". Together with my wife and two daughters we decided to book the Master Suite for 14 days, and we are so happy that we did. Orabel Suites is absolutely beautiful. It is so peaceful and relaxing. From the moment you arrive to the sad time you have to leave, nothing is to much trouble for the very attentive staff. Jannis, the Manager, provides a first class service and goes out of his way to ensure you having an enjoyable relaxing holiday. Any information that you require concerning places to visit, restaurants to eat at, car hire, boat trips, sun beds at the nearby beach etc he will arrange for you. Jannis is a plastic surgeon by profession. One day my daughter developed an ear infection. Straight away Jannis was off to the local pharmacy and purchased ear drops. He refused to accept any payment for the medication. The infection soon cleared up. Now that is providing a first class customer service !! So much has been written about the breakfast Christina serves, it has to be seen to be believed. If there is something you particularly require for breakfast, Christina will do her best to ensure you receive this. The Master Suite is beautiful, with two double bedrooms, one of which is en-suite, and an indoor jacuzzi. The domestic staff, who are so friendly, ensure your room remains spotlessly clean throughout your stay. The pool area is very quiet as most people are either off to the beach or touring the island.The beach and restaurants are a 5 minute walk away. I would recommend you take a small hand torch when walking to the restaurants at night as there are no street lights or pavements. The walk is perfectly safe, but a torch would help. There are lots of restaurants to visit. We liked, The Seaside (which is one of the more expensive ones but very good), Popeye and 41, but there are so many to try. In Fira there is a restaurant called Argo which is very good. It does get busy, so I recommend you ask Jannis to make you a reservation. We did visit a restaurant called Rosemary in Prygos. We took a taxi to Prygos (20 euro each way) and walked the steps to the top to the restaurant to see the beautiful sunset. The view is fantastic, however the food was disappointing as it was all cold. We hired a car for two days and toured the whole island. It is very easy to find your way around from the map. There are a lot of quad bikes on the road. We had a very relaxing and enjoyable time at Orabel Suites which is a beautiful boutique development. Would we go back YES !!. Would we recommend it - YES, WITHOUT DOUBT !!","August 30, 2017","23    Orabel Suites Santorini

1194,I haven't been on holiday for 8 years and have always wanted to go to Santorini...so I did lots of research and booked this place purely on the amazing reviews. The welcome by the lovely Yannis was wonderful he made you feel so welcome. The gorgeous breakfast ever morning was bought up to our terrace and was delicious. Just a short walk away was the beach and many tavernas and we ate out every night. It was so lovely and quiet here we came back quite early each night and drank wine on the terrace and was so peaceful. The staff are amazing and the pillows were the best I've ever laid on! The shower was so powerful it was amazing. All the staff were really friendly and couldn't do enough for you. We recommend going to the local Boutari vineyard where they sell one of the best rose I have ever tasted for only 7 euros! Also you must visit a lovely restaurant called Rosemary in Pyrgos for lovely food on their terrace it is 86 steps upwards but so worth it as saw the most beautiful sunset ever there.We enjoyed staying here so much we will definitely be back again. The only thing I would improve is the temperature of the pool as was quite cold but bearable. Efharisto Yannis you have a wonderful magical place we loved staying with you and see you again.Nick and Tasha ,"July 30, 2017","23    Orabel Suites Santorini

1195,"We truly enjoyed our stay. A great little boutique hotel with a very friendly host and great staff. The rooms are spacious and provide everything you need to relax and recharge. Everything is very clean and well maintained making you feel like at home. Looks like each room comes with hot tub/jacuzzi which is perfect to enjoy a bottle of wine in the evening. They offer home made breakfast (so delicious) either delivered to your terrace/balcony or can set it up next to the pool. The little oasis is slightly set back from the beach in the country side but yet well connected to reach the beach (Perivolos beach) in just 5-10min walking distance or other beautiful place like the Red Beach or Pyrgos in 15min by scooter. Besides all the popular place (Fira, Oia etc) I can highly recommend to plan a visit for a nice and dinner to Pyrgos. We actually arrived there a bit late and it was already dark but still had a nice walk through the village before having a wonderful dinner on beautiful little roof terrace overlooking the southern part of Santorini. Its a beautiful property, with a create atmosphere runned by lovely people. Can highly recommend to stay at Orabel Suites","July 23, 2017","23    Orabel Suites Santorini

1196,"Giannis has created a quaint yet polished little paradise, 5 minutes walk away from the nicest beach on the island. His personal service before you arrive is excellent, sorting anything you require such as transfers etc.His secret weapons are Thamis and Xristina! Thamis is more concierge than receptionist offers excellent advice on the island, books anything you need from transport to reservations and fixing any problems with your room. Xristina is you head chef every morning with her delicious bespoke breakfast, your cocktail / drinks maker in the afternoon evening whilst keeping the area picturesque. She also sorts any food and drink requirements outside kitchen and bar hours.My only complaint being the pool shutting early to maintain the calm quiet that makes this place so special, which is fixed by the personal hottub our room had!!

To begin, my wife and i arrived at around 8am(transfers just worked out that way) we knew our room was not due to be ready until around 12:00pm. Was that a problem? absolutely not! We were given the warmest welcome by Ioannis the managing Director who by definition is a true gentleman and scholar ( you WILL say the same thing after just 2 minutes of speaking with him) this amazing man started off by introducing the suites and there amazing services, followed by asking my wife and i about ourselves....what we liked to ea,t where we might like to go and see, dietary requirements and so on so forth, now this is the MD of he place, i knew right from there this was going to be a very special place ( my wife and i are restauranteurs so by definition highly critical and observant) He then explained that the room would be ready shortly but while we waited were more than welcome to use the facilities whilst a very special breakfast was being catered just for us(the wife and i decided to lounge on the super queen size pool bed which is heaven by the way... then came the most amazing breakfast i have ever had cooked by Christina the most amazing woman also. Now to our suite, what can i say, Luxury, boutique are just 2, our private hot tub blew my mind... My time at the Orabel Suites was something i will never forget, from start to finish my wife and i were made to feel like we had honestly died and gone to heaven. I thank you Ioannis you have done n amazing job and i honestly feel that i stayed with family in the most amazing location and accommodation...not just any family...the perfect one....I tip my hat to you sir...and i will be back every year hopefully more than once.

It is a quick walk down to Perivolos beach with restaurants and it is easy enough to get a taxi into more touristy areas such as Oia.

Christina cooks breakfast as and when you want it and lays it out either in your room, on the terrace or by the pool. I wouldnt hesitate to recommend Orabel Suites for a relaxing break.

1202,"If I could live at the Orabel Suites for the rest of my life, I'd die a happy man! My wife and I went to Santorini (I've left a full review of Santorini on Expedia) and stayed at Orabel. First and foremost it's beauty is striking. The grounds are stunning and the pool area is just magnificent. We stayed in the Honeymoon Suite with the indoor Jacuzzi, a really good idea if you're quite private as we are. The room was beautifully modern, with all bits and bobs that you need. The jacuzzi was amazing, although make sure you tell reception to turn up the temperature if its a little too cool for you as it was for us. The staff are just the best! Yannis the owner is a top bloke, he'll go out of his way to assist you in any way that he can. Themis at reception in the evenings was just as lovely as Yannis and would also do what she could to help. To prove what I mean, Yannis brought us a bag from home so we could take it out with us one day, and Themis leant us her 2 pin USB plug. Now what hotel staff do that for you? The all inclusive breakfast's were just the best! Christine the chef made us something different everyday and she took into account that we were Muslim and our other dietary restrictions. Just trust me, those breakfasts will live with you forever. Insofar as location is concerned, Orabel is a 5 minute walk from Perivolos beach (literally 5 minutes down an almost straight road), but yet is far enough away from the hustle and bustle to be a private sanctuary. As Santorini Island is about 15-20 miles long, we got a car for a few days and a quad bike for a few days (only get a quad bike if you can handle a cold breeze whilst you're on it!) and we toured the whole island. Please do not think that Orabel isn't for you because its at Perivolos, which is the opposite side of the island from the beautiful Oia. Santorini is so small that you can get from one side of it to the other in an hour or two. I cannot recommend Orabel highly enough - we stayed there for 10 nights and its an experience I will never forget. Go and stay there - you won't regret it - and you'll thank me for this review when you get back!","May 28, 2017","23    Orabel Suites Santorini

1203,"You wouldn't think it possible, but we were absolutely blown away when we were here in September last year and although we thought the gardens and planting needed time to develop, we didn't think that there was much that could be improved.We were wrong.We said when we left here we would return... I've said that before and haven't followed through. This time was very different.We kept in touch with Jannis by email all through the winter, booked for May and again for this coming September. We also wanted to be sure that Christina would still be here... when we arrived it was truly a joyous moment with huge hugs all round. It was like coming back to special family! It's hard to put a finger on it, but I haven't stopped smiling since I got off the plane.We will return here again and again... that's a promise that you can take to the bank.Small things have been improved, but it wouldn't be possible to make big improvements because it would have had to have been a long way from perfect last year. It wasn't.This time we have friends who have joined us, we have more friends coming here in June and nobody will be disappointed, in spite of the tremendous praise we've already heaped upon Jannis and Christina.Add to the mix, Ria, Themis and Ela and you have something very special indeed.","May 14, 2017","23    Orabel Suites Santorini

They are always available to answer for any question and give you all the information you need to have a good time in Santorini! The hotel is located in a quiet area and close to Perivolos beach (best beach in Santorini) and if you want to go further, Iannis can arrange either taxi or car/scooter/quad renting that will come directly to the hotel. This for us was very helpful because we got to see every bit of the island on a quad! They can even arrange transfer from the airport/port if you are interested.

1208,"Orabel Suites was the best Holiday experience I have ever had in my life!Starting from the room itself, the suite we had paid was the master suite, with 2 separate bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, jacuzzi, living area and a great patio looking at the pool side.The cleanliness was excellent. The furniture and the general ambience reveals that the people who own the place, want to offer their guests, the best experience.The gardens, the pool and all surroundings make you feel like you are in paradise.Breakfast is served either in you room, at the balcony or by the pool and except of being rich and tasty, it was different every day. Products from their garden, fresh juice , pastrys, honey, yogurt and little surprises!!!Staff was great and made you feel like home and of course welcome.Owners , Yiannis and Ria and the kindest people on the island.The pool bar was open until 23:00 and Yiannis' cocktails were the best choice.Although there is no restaurant in house, a huge variety of restaurants and beach bars are around the corner and on top of that, you can make your order to the reception and everything will be brought to you in your suite. In 800m you find yourself next to Perivolos beach (black beach) were there is nothing you look for and you cannot find it.Owners have also arranged free use of the sun beds and umbrellas by the best beach bar of the island. Only thing you have to do is to inform the hotel and they arrange it for you. Worth mentioning that other visitors have to pay minimum € 20 to use them.The best choice for those who seek for luxury, relaxation, quiet and value for money!We will be back for sure and not just once !Thank you guys!!!","November 10, 2016","23    Orabel Suites Santorini

1209,"My girlfriend and I booked Orabel Suites for a week in October 2016. We stumbled across the hotel by chance as a cheap deal appeared for flights + accommodation and after a quick google of the hotel decided it was worth the risk (since these cheap deals aren't always as luxurious as they sound) - my word are we glad we did!Our flights to Santorini were overnight and so we arrived at Orabel Suites shortly after 6am. We were worried that, given check-in wasn't until 2pm, we would be left waiting sleepily by the pool or wandering the streets until we would be able to check into our room in the afternoon. To our surprise, having booked a transfer from the airport in advance (the hotel provides this service for €45 each way) the taxi driver, a friend of the hotel owner, showed us to our room (carrying our luggage) and assured us we would not be disturbed until we were ready to go and check in, allowing us to catch up on some much needed sleep.This theme of friendly, accommodating service continued throughout the week. Chris (the hotel manager), Christina (the chef) and Eddie (the barman) were all amongst the most courteous and helpful staff I have ever come across in my travels. Every effort was made to make our stay enjoyable at every turn, from giving us a lighter with 'santorini' on as a gift on our first day (Christina said she had two so wanted us to have one), to making us sandwiches for our flight home (since they didn't want us to miss breakfast) our holiday was made all the more relaxing and enjoyable by such a warm and friendly home for the week.The room itself was spacious, clean and well equipped. Soap, shampoo, shower gel etc are all complimentary and the layout makes the room feel like your own flat for the week, with the bedroom on an elevated level. Add to this the hot tub and sofa on the balcony from which you can lie and watch the sun set over the mountain and the value for money becomes outstanding. Only a short walk away (5 mins) in the beach where there are plenty of options for cafes, bars and restaurants all the way along to Parissa. If you would like to venture further afield and explore the island cars can be rented from reception. We hired a Fiat 500 convertible for a day which cost €55 (from 10am one morning to 10am the following day) but cheaper options are available. The car is simply dropped off at the hotel for you at your requested time and picked up again when you are finished - very convenient. Our stay included free breakfast each morning which, from past experience, we expected to be a buffet. How wrong we were. The Orabel Suites breakfast is something that must be seen to be believed (see attached pictures). A quick phone call down to Chris at reception and breakfast is brought up to you on your balcony within 10 minutes for you to enjoy in the sunshine. Laid out on the table for you, the breakfast is vast. Yoghurt with honey and granola, breads with jam and honey, cereal, orange juice and your choice of tea or coffee. On top of this, each day there is a different 'main', usually either a hollowed out bread loaf with shakshuka-style fried egg, peppers and feta cheese inside, or an omelette. On top of all of that some days also included Christina's homemade cake (we had her strawberry cake which was fantastic). Needless to say, lunch was not always necessary, especially if we had a late breakfast. Other enjoyable points to note are the soft, un-intrusive music softly playing by the pool, the waterfall into the pool that lights up beautifully after dark and the bar from which the owner Yanis made us some stunning cocktails (as gin fans the Hendricks Crush was delicious).All in all Orabel Suites could not come more highly recommended from a young couple who enjoyed a fantastic romantic break away in Santorini.","November 3, 2016","23    Orabel Suites Santorini

Walk to bus stop at the bottom of hill. Eleftheria was very helpful getting taxis and recommending things to do and see. She was very prompt at solving small issues that came up during the week. We stayed in the studios which are quiet and just far enough away from the crowds of day trippers from the cruise ships. If choosing a studio get the one that has the private balcony the others are a shared balcony. The sunsets are amazing! Would definitely stay here again.

1219,"LocationThirea suites is located at the start of the Main Street and just by the town square. It’s a few minutes from a bus stop (and about 10 minutes walk to the main bus terminal and taxi rank). Probably 15-20 minutes to main spot for Oia sunset. It’s down a fairly long path made of some trickier and steep steps but the views are well worth itThere are 2 local supermarkets to get your essentials and an abundance of cafes restaurants and shops The main road is well paved but can get busy in evenings with everyone vying to see the infamous sunset and whilst I have seen people in flip flops I’m glad I had more sensible sandals The room We stayed in suite 6. The views were phenomenal. We had a jet tub outside on our terrace.Room was enormous with kitchen, lounge area, king sized bed and a massive bathroom. Air con is standard.We loved staying in a cave. It was so tranquil but the service was impeccable. Daily room service as you would find in a hotel but without the intrusion of other guests. We hardly even heard our neighbours. You need to switch hot water on about 30 minutes beforehand. Also remember like all places in Greece you cannot dispose of tissue in the toilets but must do so in bins provided Plenty of towels, bath robe, toiletries were provided and changed daily. Iron, hair dryer, safe, fridge and even a bottle of water to get you started were also found in the room. Tea making facilities with basic kitchen utensils are provided too.BreakfastServed between 8 and 10 each morning. You need to call reception about 15-30 minutes beforehand and they will bring this to your terrace There were slight variations each day but consisted mainly of freshly squeezed orange juice, breads, yoghurt, fruits and cooked egg. Amenities They arranged hotel transfer (non private) for €30 for 2 of us each wayCheck in is after 2pm and check out after 12pm but they can store your luggage if you have a later flight (which we did)They will help you carry your luggage up and down the path which was a god send because sometimes it was hard enough getting our selves up those steps. You can order in food and also arrange for on site massages and beauty treatments.The pool is not heated but you don’t really need it in the heat. It’s has jets which need to be turned on at regular intervals. Was amazing sipping a glass of wine and admiring the views from tub. Adequate shade and sun in terrace for those who want to top up their ran and those who want to escape the sweltering heat Handy extendable dying rack for your we clothes on terrace tool as well as deck checks and seating/table","August 24, 2018","24    Thirea Suites & Studios

1221,"We stayed here for our honeymoon at the end of July, beginning of August. We couldn't have wished for a better place to stay. The rooms, views and staff are fantastic. The hotel sort you out a transfer from the airport which saves so much hassle. From the moment we met the transfer man we didn't touch our case again until we were back at the airport going home! The man at the hotel impressively carries both heavy suitcases down steps and back up on your return. Our flight was delayed but this wasn't a problem for the hotel we still got a warm welcome and the next day the lady from reception went out of her way to say hello and welcome us to the hotel. All the staff are amazingly kind and respectful. I miss our delicious breakfasts on the terrace everyday! The views are incredible, like no other. The rooms are luxurious and private. Having your own private hot tub over looking the ocean is a perfect way to while away the evenings with a glass or two. We booked a sailing trip and wine tour through the reception and both were fantastic when one tour was booked up she rang a different contact to ensure we could do the trip we wanted. On the day we were celebrating it being exactly a week married the hotel brought us cheese, olives and wine which was a lovely thoughtful gesture. The hotel is perfectly located in Oia. You just walk up the steps and you are in town with high end shops, restaurants etc. The local bus is right outside too making it easy to visit other towns.","August 14, 2018","24    Thirea Suites & Studios

1222,"We loved our stay in Thiera Suites ! We came to celebrate our anniversary and it completely exceeded all our expectations . Firstly , they are located at the entrance of magical town of Oia , where you are met by the lovely lady who manages the place and a porter to take your suitcases down . There are steps , quite a few of them but it all adds to the charm of the place . We were lucky to be given suite 4 , which was the most private of them all with its own entrance and a massive terrace with hot tub overlooking the sea below . Words can’t describe how beautiful it is !!! And then the room itself , so elegant and spacious , with everything you might need ( fridge , coffee machine , kettle , cutlery allprovided ) during your stay . We were also given a small bottle of prosseco on arrival , which was lovely ! The bathroom was amazing ! It is huge , with great shower / jacuzzi bath combo . This was , in our opinion, without the doubt the best place to stay in Oia because of its private location . There is a very expensive hotel in town called ‘ Secret Santorini’ which is located on the main thoroughfare in Oia , but for us this was the only place that can call itself ‘secret Santorini ‘ because you are blessed to have your own oasis just outside of all the hustle and bustle in Oia town . We can’t recommend this place highly enough , if we come back to Santorini this would be the only place we would ever consider staying in !

1232,"BUYER BEWARE: this place is actually two separate locations. One is ""Thirea Suites"" and the other is ""Thirea Studios"". Each location is much different than the other - as shown on the website. This review is for ""Thirea Studios"". I unknowingly booked this studio via Expedia, expecting a suite... because on Expedia it was represented as a ""Traditional Apartment"". As you can imagine, I was disappointed that my studio was not as elaborate as the pictures on the website. Very average B&B with basic services and housekeeping. If you want a luxurious place to stay with very good service, this is not the place. Not all studios within Thirea Studios are equal, some are much smaller than others. Mine did not have a jacuzzi and I suspect that there are more than one that do not have a jacuzzi. The location is great, it is in the cliffside amongst all the other cave houses/cave hotels. The view is amazing. It is close to a market and a few restaurants. The host is good, but not great. There was a miscommunication during my departure and I had no help carrying several heavy suitcases up all the stairs. This was extremely tiring and unpleasant.. I was soaked in sweat because of this.... and had to bear with my sweat drenched clothes for my flight home to the USA. You have to flip a switch in the circuit breaker to heat up the water for 20 mins before showering. Hot water only lasted for 45 seconds before the rest of the shower was lukewarm or slightly cold for the remainder of the shower. Breakfast ingredients are provided (yogurt, fresh fruit on some days, cold cuts/luncheon meat, bread, water). Housekeeping standards were very sproad'ic. Some days housekeeping would forget certain types of towels, napkins, an extra roll of toilet paper, breakfast ingredients, etc. If all you are concerned with is the location with respects to Oia (10-15 minute walk), it is a great location in the cliff side, the cave house feel is very authentic, and a great view of the caldera - this is a very affordable option. For everything else, expect the average as this is definitely nothing more than a B&B.","August 23, 2017","24    Thirea Suites & Studios

Patience tested and ready for the trip to be over. We arrived and were welcomed by the most stunning view of the Caldera, clean (huge!) suite room, the loveliest and obliging host, Eleftheria, and our muscle man porter (. The location could not be better. The service could not be better. The ambience could not be better. I am definitely returning to this accommodation. I love the self sufficiency offered by the apartment. Fridge stocked daily with breakfast foods and water - all inclusive. Eleftheria also gifted us a local wine half way through our stay.

1236,"We have just left Thirea Suites in Santorini and we are very sad to go. We stayed here on our honeymoon and our suite was just perfect. Clean, new and modern while very charming it ""feels"" very Santorini. We had a stunning view of the Caldera and a tub on our balcony which we really enjoyed. Breakfast was served there each morning and it was delicious. Eleftheria is the best. She attended to every detail and took care of us beyond our expectations. Even ensuring we had a private transfer by Mercedes after we enjoyed the sunset sailing tour (which I highly recommend). Situated right next door to the much more expensive Canaves Oia (I looked into it and wanted to stay there originally but not for 3x the price), this little gem is a treasure and we are so glad we stayed here while in Santorini.

We also sat outside for a sunset drinking wine we had purchased from of the wineries on Santorini. The stairs down to the room are uneven and steep.

It is honestly worth every penny and wish we would have stayed here at least another night. This was by far the most memorable stay at a hotel that I have ever experienced. The customer service is amazing as well. We contacted the front desk upon our arrival and they met with us to assist us with our luggage. This suite is carved into the cliff side so it takes some time to get down to the suites. As we walked down to our suite our jaws dropped because the view was absolutely breathtaking. Everything about the suite was simply beautiful. The most amazing part was in the morning opening the doors and shutters and waking up to that view. Breakfast was served on the balcony in the morning which was set up so beautifully and was absolutely delicious. When we left again we were assisted with our luggage, such amazing customer service! The man who assisted us with our luggage even offered to take my husband on his scooter to the car so we wouldn't have to walk our luggage! I've described this suite as best as I can but in all honesty words cannot even describe this amazing stay/experience at Thirea Suites.

1249,"This hotel is AMAZING - better than expected! Location: The location is a bit hard to find initially, but that's only because it's right in the cliff. Easily solved by calling the hotel - they met us where we were dropped off and helped with the luggage. Other than that, being right in Oia was the best - super convenient! The View: From the room out to the caldera was better than we dreamed it would be. It was like a dream every morning. The only down side is you don't get a sunset view - but we easily walked over to see the sunset views. Still gorgeous! The Room: Very spacious, very clean. We were beyond impressed with the condition of the room! The bed was very comfortable, and robes and slippers were provided. We didn't have a pool on our balcony but some units did and it looked fab :) Be prepared to walk many stairs to get up to the main road though. Breakfast: Was served right on our balcony, overlooking the water (the best way to enjoy breakfast imho). An assortment of breads/ muffins and fruits, plus some eggs, ham/cheese, and yogurt with granola. Always fresh squeezed orange juice and coffee. An amazing way to start the day! Overall: 10/10, would stay again. So lux and charming :) ","September 7, 2016","24    Thirea Suites & Studios

1250,"This review covers the Suites as the Studios are located on a separate property, but not far away. There are three suites to choose from and due to demand, it is not always possible to get the best suite(s). However, all three suites are beautiful with only one out of three not having an outdoor hot tub. Our stay had to be split between the suite without a tub and one with a tub, but at the end of the day, the entire stay was equally comfortable and enjoyable. The tubs are warm, so are not necessarily the answer to a quick cool down in the hot August weather, so instead you are able to use the swimming pool at a nearby hotel at a modest charge. It would appear that a swimming pool on this property is planned for the future, which will be cool. There are not many properties in Oia that actually offer a pool.The suites are ideally located, being slightly off the beaten tourist path, which means that there is more privacy. There are not too many stairs that need to be negotiated every day to get to the property and the property is on the edge of the cliff meaning that nothing is in front to block the magnificent views over the caldera. Each suite is of the typical cave construction type and has a beautifully appointed interior with every comfort that you may wish for. The property is immaculate and very well cared for.The couple that manage the property are extremely friendly and helpful. The breakfast that is served on your balcony every morning is excellent and can only be described as an abundance of food. We stayed for 6 nights, and every breakfast was different, which is not something you usually see at a property such as this.Oia has become a relatively expensive destination, so when you consider the level of accommodation you are getting here when compared to the other upmarket properties in Oia, the price represents good value.Highly recommended","September 5, 2016","24    Thirea Suites & Studios

1256,"My wife and I stayed for 3 nights in Thirea Suites and Studios in early July 2015. Since the studios section was newly done, we did not have any reviews to fall back upon during our bookings. But as we wanted to stay on in Oia and most hotels were booked by then we took a chance with this place...and we dint regret a bit. First, when in Santorini please stay in Oia only. Trust me on this. Although the hotels in Oia are expensive, than other locations in Santorini, it is totally worth. So we arrived in Santorini and from our travel from port to the Fira (town) we wondered why this island is said to be one of the most beautiful islands in Greece, until we reached Oia and we got he answer. Serene, Beatiful, Amazing.Out stay in Oia was made much more plesant by our stay in Thirea Studios. The room has a small balcony overlooking the sea with amazing view of caldera. Room was average size, not too small not too spacios. Acceptable. The bathroom had a mid-sized jaccuzzi, with privacy but at the same time facing the sea. We were super happy.The location of the hotel was also good. Not in heart of Oia but very much there. Walking distance to the sun-set point, shopping area, amazing restaurants. But since Oia is at the corner of the Santorini island, the travel to other locations is via Fira town which would be little time consuming. I would still stay in Oia for it beauty.The only thing missing during our stay was the breakfast spread for the price we were paying (300 Euros a night). The hotel doesnt have a dining area and hence the breakfast is served in a basket in your balcony. For veggies like us it is mainly flakes, fruits, bread and some puffs. We were not happy with same, although the disppointment was overcome by the view from the balcony.The hospitality by Thirea was very good. We were not able to make card payments since the banking in Greece was not operating due to the crisis issues. So our payments to the hotel was after nearly 3-4 weeks of our stay, still they were quite cordial. Would definitely come back here. As said earlier, if I come back to Santorini, I will stay only in Oia.","September 18, 2015","24    Thirea Suites & Studios

1259,"Thirea suites have three rooms and I booked the one with the hot tub and it was absolutely amazing!I got to Oia around 8am and Elefheria was very kind to arrange check in at that time. Sotiris came right to the Oia Main Street to help take the luggage down in the scorching heat...The hotel is on the Main Street but also gives a sense of privacy as it's located at the bottom of the slopes.The walk down is about 2 mins and once you are in your room, the privacy and view is absolutely breath taking.Elefheria was kind enough to serve breakfast the morning I arrived - although it was not part of the rate for that day, it costed an extra €10 -- the breakfast was great and healthy - had egg white, fresh fruits, juice fresh bread and amazing Greek yogurt. The breakfast is about the same everyday.On the first day, the water in the hot tub wasn't really that hot- so Sotoris was kind enough to regulate the temperature and it was absolutely perfect thereafter. There is no pool on the property and only two rooms have a hot tubThe room was absolutely stunning with the bed facing the sea. The bathroom has a jacuzzi tub and a lovely open shower. The balcony is small and cute too. The room is equipped with a small kitchenette and has the basic utensils.Santorini is a must visit to experience how beautiful the place really is.During the month of August, it's worth noting that it gets really hot and staying indoor and enjoying the hot tub and view is blissful .. I would leave around 1830 hours to head up to the Main Street to watch the magical sunset as the weather was perfect. It's a great vibe at that time too.Highly recommend staying at Thirea SuitesThe staff are extremely warm and friendly.

1260,"Unbelievable! I couldn’t stop ahing and ohing when I walked up the stairs and entered our Vinsanto room. Yota the owner has 3 rooms she rents out and we stayed in both the Vinsanto and the Nykteri. We liked the Vinsanto because it’s even bigger (whole 1st floor) and it has places to lounge in the front and the back so at any time of the day you will have sunshine. Even though it’s higher and you will have a bit more wind up there is still was not to cold to use the pool. But Nykteri is equally beautiful. Both houses are really big and have 2 sleeping rooms so for 2 persons it felt like luxury. Both houses are beautifully designed and you have front view over the sea and side view over de vineyards. There are loungeareas wherever you look, it has a kitchen and you can even decide that Yota will cook you a meal. She is very friendly, and also very quick to respond to any question you might have.

1262,"YES we came to Oia with our 2 year old, and we couldn't be happier to pick Vino Houses as our home for 3 nights. Yota, the owner and host of the property is the nicest and most understanding lady! She was so accommodating to all our request (mostly kid related) and was super nice to our son. First thing he did every morning was go over to the reception and say hello to Yota and her dog :) As soon as we arrived, we were welcomed by Yota and were given a brief but thorough description of the island and places of interest. Yota recommended places to eat and places to visit for our stay and provided a map of the island. She was there every day and was very accessible when we were out. The place itself was perfect for us. Close enough to the town of Oia, but far enough from the crowds. We had parking right on the property and there was plenty of fenced off areas for our toddler to run around and explore. If you plan to explore the beaches, I highly recommend renting a car. The beach walking distance to the property can be choppy and not kid friendly as Kamari and some of the southern beaches. We stayed in the Nykteri house and everything was perfect and just as pictured! I would highly recommend the Nykteri house with anyone traveling with kids as it seems to be the most private one of the 3 and doesn't involve any stairs. Yota had a baby cot set up for us with all the appropriate linens. Towels and sheets were not changed everyday but if we requested clean ones, we had them right away. Breakfast was delicious with good variety. Get the omelette!!! Overall, you will not get a nicer place for the price in Santorini!

Our villa was extremely spacious, very clean, and very comfortable. The AC worked well and the stay comes with a really generous spread of breakfast every morning (made to order, huge, fresh breakfast with food from the garden). The location of the property is great - it's about a 10 minute walk up an uphill path to a small village called Finikia, where we had an incredible dinner at Lefkes (we walked up there at night and found the place easily). It's about a 30 minute walk (with some uphill terrain) to the main part of Oia town, but especially in the height of summer when Oia is so crowded, we were so happy to be kind of removed from all that in this peaceful quiet space.","September 13, 2018","25    Vino Houses

The house itself was beautifully decorated and nicely situated. Not in the hustle and bustle of Oia, where it can sometimes be too touristy. We rented ATVs to get around, this is advisable. We would like to thank the hostess Yota again for her hospitality.We hope to be able to go back someday.

1266,"We stayed for 5 nights in the Athiri villa. The villa was impeccably decorated, luxurious and we absolutely loved the outdoor pool. It was so lovely to come back to Vino Houses after a busy day sightseeing in the more crowded areas of Santorini. The location is great for those who would like to be able to walk to a local beach, winery and relax in the peace and quiet. The nearby village Finikia is also great for tavernas and getting a glimpse of the more traditional way of life on the island. Thank you so much to our host Yota who was so kind and helped us with anything we needed. The breakfast was also amazing and full of fresh and healthy ingredients (many of which were homegrown). We hope to visit this lovely slice of paradise again one day!","July 20, 2018","25    Vino Houses

1267,"The villa is beautiful inside and out, classic minimalistic and clean. There is a couch bed, a personal jacuzzi pool, and a table and chairs at the front of the villa as well as 2 sun loungers, basically everything you need. There is another additional cushioned seating area at the back of the villa. The villa and bathrooms were very clean and were cleaned daily by a very friendly cleaner. The breakfast was lovely and you could select on arrival what you wanted to have, and choose as many items as you like. The tomatoes and cumbers where picked fresh from the vineyard. The owner Yota is very friendly and helpful she will go out of her way to help or arrange anything you want to do. She gave us the information on every part of the island as well as places to eat, places to visit and boat trips etc. She was happy to book our reservations and taxis whenever needed and was always around to speak to. She recommended the vineyard/restaurant which was a five-minute walk from the villa and was gorgeous. She also arranged our quad bike and it arrived the same day. The villa is situated in Finikia and is a little drive from Oia (a very popular area and sunset spot), it is also possible to drive to Fira/Thera from the villa where there are shops, lots of restaurants and nightlife. Overall the villa was amazing and I really recommend it to anyone looking for somewhere to stay in Santorini.","June 26, 2018","25    Vino Houses

1269,"From the time of booking this holiday the host of Vino Houses could not have been more helpful. Vino Houses rest just outside of Oia and are an excellent base to explore Santorini.On arrival Yota, the owner explained the island to us and organised transport into Oia, a Sunset Cruise, restaurants nothing was too much trouble. If you are planning to travel to Santorini make this your first choice to stay, I guarantee you will not be disappointed. We asked for a restaurant in Oia to watch the Sunset ( which are spectacular in Santorini) Yota booked a table at a restaurant called Ochre we had the best table overlooking the sea and witnessed the best sunset of the holiday, this was provided as part of the service and always with a smile. I will definitely be returning to Santorini and would nt choose anywhere else to stay.","June 20, 2018","25    Vino Houses

1270,"We recently spent 12 nights island hopping around Greece and 3 nights in Santorini was our final leg. We really struggled when booking accommodation in Santorini as couldn’t justify how expensive it was for fairly average accommodation on the island (rose petals spread across bedding just doesn’t do it for us). The second we found Vino Houses we knew it was perfect for us and we weren’t left disappointed! We are so glad we opted to stay just outside of Oia and not in the main town, it is unbearable and that was in June I cannot bear to think what it would be like later in the season. Yota is the perfect host - always informative and quick to respond to any query via email from the second you book right through until your stay. She helped by making dinner reservations for us, gave advice of what we should do to maximise our time on the island and ordered an ATV to be delivered when we arrived. We had many chats with Yota and thoroughly enjoyed her company - it’s lovely to see someone take such pride in what they do. You pick your breakfast items when you arrive and they are delivered to your terrace at your chosen time each morning. Produce is fresh from the garden and everything was very tasty. We stayed in Athiri and it was beautiful - big and bright with two big double bedrooms. The beds were so comfortable, we slept so well there. The best feature is probably the amazing terrace featuring a huge hot tub that overlooks the vineyards out to the sea. We loved everything about our room but I’m sure the other two rooms were just as impressive! It was about 10 minutes to drive into Oia and approximately 30 minutes to other main towns but we would choose Vino Houses over anywhere else we saw in Santorini! Thank you Yota for making our time here so special. ","June 19, 2018","25    Vino Houses

She strives for perfection and to create a memorable stay in Santorini. The place is meticulously designed giving it a fresh modern but welcome feel making you instantly feel like you are staying at a home away from home. The villa is located in a quiet field area just next to a pedestrian path leading to the beatiful villages Oia and Finikia just a short walking distance away.The breakfast was delicious abundant and very healthy consisting of boiled eggs, bread, bacon, cheese, greek yogurt honey and fresh fruit which was what we chose from a very long list Yota herself provided on arrival. The first day we decided to spend some quality time at our villa and opted to order dinner from Yota. It was delicious highly recommend it. One of the best meals we had in Santorini.

1272,"Wow, where do I begin?! I wanted to wait until the end of my trip to review after staying at numerous different hotels in Santorini and Mykonos. First and foremost, Yota — the manager/owner of Vino House had amazing communication with me from the moment I booked, until the very last minute of me leaving Vino Houses. You can tell her heart is in this place and it’s not just a job to her. She is detailed and everything was immaculate. She’ll tell you everything you need to know and she’ll do whatever she can to assist you. If I emailed her with an issue or I needed something, she was knocking on our door within minutes! She’s A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!I stayed in the beautiful Athiri villa of Vino Houses with a friend of mine. It was my pre-wedding trip with girlfriends, before the big “I Do”. It looks exactly like the pictures or even better in real life, honestly. It’s off the beaten path and south of the famous village of Oia. It’s secluded, where all you hear are birds chirping and the sea as your view. It was so peaceful staying there. There is a pedestrian walkway almost right next to Vino Houses, where you can walk into town and to the main st. of Oia; it’s about a 15 min walk. It was nice that Oia was close enough to walk to, so we could catch the sunset but to be able to come back to Vino Houses to just relax and be away from all the hustle and bustle was priceless.The Athiri villa itself was so stunning. You’d never get that space and size for the price it is being offered at for something in the main area of Oia. It was like having your own little house. We had a 2 bedroom, with living and dining space. Plus, the amazing patio with our own personal pool with jets. Every morning they served us the most amazing breakfast on the patio, so you can just take in the sun and view of the sea. It’s also walking distance to Domaine Sigalas.I am still daydreaming of my time there. I’d recommend anyone and everyone to stay there. It was definitely the highlight of my trip. The service that Yota provides you is such high quality. She makes you feel like family and that you’re coming home to visit.

Giota is such a lovely human -- she is warm and caring and it makes your stay that much more enjoyable. She helped us plan adventures, book cars when needed and find amazing places to eat and even found a place for my iPhone screen repair when I shattered my screen. I was initially worried that we were too far from Oia, but it is the perfect location. It was nice to be a bit separated from all of that and there is a really lovely village super close to Vino Houses that is a very short walk and fun to explore and good restaurants.

1286,"I always leave good reviews and mention the positives where applicable, but on this occasion felt compelled to leave an appropriate review down to our disappointment with the stay.We stayed here on the last night of our honeymoon as our flight was the day after our previous accommodation and they were full. In hindsight we wished we had picked somewhere else. When we arrived at 11am to drop our bags off we were told to wait and someone from reception would be with us in 10 mins. Over 30 minutes later and we were still waiting. We called the numbers a couple of times but no answer and were again told that someone would be with us shortly.Eventually the girl on reception appeared and gave us check in details, they stored our bags and told us to come back at 2pm. No apology, she couldn’t have seemed less interested. I asked as it was our last night on honeymoon and that we had sat wasting our last day, waiting for staff to arrive, if they had any possible upgrades available could they let me know when we came to check in.On returning to check in we were told the manager wanted €100 extra for the upgrade to the suite and nothing else was available.Had the staffs attitude and service been pleasant, I would usually have happily paid this, however the clear lack of care and poor attitude meant I didn’t want to give the property any more money than we had already paid. Personally for me, if I knew a customer was unhappy with the customer service and on a special holiday I would want to rectify it, but this hotel clearly doesn’t work like that. Following on from the above, our stay just went further downhill. The bathroom has rusted screws and smelled damp, one of the lights didn’t work, and the toiletries provided were dirty. (Pics attached) The bed was the hardest bed I’ve ever slept in at a hotel. We also found the location really noisy. At 12.30am I had to go onto our balcony and ask the guests above if they minded keeping the noise down. You could also hear other groups nearby shouting and being rowdy well past 1am. Although not the hotels fault, the location was far too noisy for us. We were thankful that we had only booked here for a night! Breakfast was really really average to other places we’ve experienced. Packet croissants and cake, with some over processed meat and cheese. For our nearly 2 weeks on the island, all food we have had has been great, there is just no need to provide a cheap breakfast. We headed elsewhere to get some good food. Furthermore to when we arrived - After tipping the porter to carry our bags for us, we had to carry them ourselves to the reception so they could be stored securely. Otherwise they would have been left in the entrance of the hotel for passing guests to see. Positives - the bed has some cool lights underneath that give the room a bit of atmosphere.There’s a nice ginger cat nearby. The hospitality and friendliness of everyone we have met in Santorini has been wonderful, sadly I cannot say the same for here and we would not return or recommend.It left a really sour taste on our last day on our honeymoon in Santorini which was a real shame.

Many broken amenities in the suite, the “hot tub” is not hot at all just mediocrely warm (which for an indoor pool kind of defeats the purpose of the entire thing), and there are random holes in the flooring that are simply not repaired. It’s a beautiful room and is still stunning, but for the price of the suite, I would suggest finding another place.

1292,"We stayed here for 6 nights as part of our island hopping honeymoon.Ok arrival, Amanda provided us with lots of information about the best restaurants to eat in and which to be careful about as some charge tourists more than on their menus, so watch out for that.Our room was fantastic, we stayed in room 6, it was quite small, but I guess they all are as the hotel is literally built on the side of the volcanic edge, but the views from our balcony were stunning and every morning we woke up we were wowed again and again.Breakfast was plentiful, bought to us each day on a large tray. Room was cleaned daily, new towels daily and room was cleaned to a spotless condition.Towels available for pool and lounging, we never had trouble finding somewhere to lay in the sun, I think most people go out exploring which we did, but enjoyed sitting on the top terrace enjoying the sunshine and the view. Amanda also recommended a boat cruise with ‘blue cruisers’ there is a separate review, this was a fantastic trip, semi private, 5 course meal, there was only 8 of us on the cruise and although more expensive than others, this was semi private and not one of the larger boat tours with blaring music we saw. We worth the money.We are flying out from Santorini airport and have seen some horrendous reviews about the airport, so we’ll wait and see what that’s like, but would recommend a ferry to another island, maybe Crete and flying from there, which we have done many times, or flying from Athens instead of from here.Only recommendation to the hotel would be the use of plastic glasses around the terraces and pool as we were worried about breaking glasses with people walking about.All in all though a great place to stay, absolutely wonderful views of the volcano and sea, lovely restaurants all around, Anogi was our favourite and went there a few times and very reasonable prices. Lovely helpful staff at the hotel, couldn’t recommend enough for anyone staying in Santorini.","July 12, 2018","26    Nefeli Homes

1293,"Nefeli Homes is a charming hotel in Imerovigli. You need to climb quite a few steps to reach the hotel as it is situated an a cliff overlooking the sea. We had booked a 1 bedroom apartment which had a double bed in the bedroom and 2 single beds in the dining room and a hot tub on the balcony overlooking the sea. The single beds can be used as a seating as well. The apartment doesn't have a cupboard for clothes which was very inconvenient. A few hangers are available. The dining room had a music system so that was an additional bonus. The extremely strange part of the apartment was that the kitchenette was part of the bathroom!! There was a door to the kitchenette and past it was the bathroom. Very strange and unsettling!! The shower area is extremely tiny. The balcony had a hot tub and 2 chairs facing the sea. What a fab ulous view. Another strange thing was that our neighbour had to walk through our balcony to leave their apartment. So in other words we had no privacy. The apts on the lower level had no privacy as tourists use the path in front to walk past as it is a public path. Breakfast is very limited which could be an issue if you spend more than a couple of days here. Breakfast is a fixed menu and the items are brought to your table. The bus stop, pharmacy and grocery store are a stone's throw away.","June 11, 2018","26    Nefeli Homes

1294,Nefeli Homes was awesome and the price compared to Oia and Fira was great. I think the area of Imerovigli is great being between two busier towns but still great views. You don’t have a direct view of the sunset (although you have a great view of the island) but it is a short walk to a great view point with less of a crowd then Oia. The hot tub was great too after a day of wandering around the island. The hotel is also a short walk to the bus that goes between Oia and Fira ,"May 27, 2018","26    Nefeli Homes

The staff are all extremely friendly and Amanda in particular, did everything to ensure we had a memorable stay. The room (Cave Senior Double with Hot Tub) was exactly as pictured/advertised on the website. And the breakfast each morning was great - it’s served on the main terrace which has spectacular views out to the ocean. We can highly recommend Nefeli - it was superb.

The view from the entire hotel is just breath taking. We had emailed the hotel before our arrival to organise for someone to pick us up from the ferry. This was flawless and 25 euros (other people told us they paid 35 euros when they took their own taxi) Check in/check out was really quick.Amanda and Alex are absolutely amazing.Both of them go out of their way to help us.Amanda also helped us to book our hotel in Athens and gave us many recommendations for restaurants and activities. We also booked ATV through the hotel and it was really easy.It is an easy walk to Fira and there are yummy restaurants around.The bed was very comfortable and there were many sitting areas in the room and on the balcony which made it really enjoyable.  We would definitely recommend the hotel and this specific room. The pool is also very nice when it gets hot (not all hotels have one) and the terrace was so nice that we saw a couple people come in from other hotels to try and relax on the private terrace!Overall great stay, thanks Amanda and Alex, for making this an unforgettable week!

The pool area is stunning with an amazing view.The staff, Amanda and Alex were amazing, extremely friendly and always on hand to help or answer queries. They really could not of done any more to improve the stay and we were even given an upgrade to the honeymoon suite which was out of this world. A cave suite with 3 rooms including an indoor pool and private balcony.. I have never seen a room like it! Alex even provided our breakfast for our last morning the night before, in the fridge so we could get up and watch the sunrise with breakfast by the pool before our early transfer (also arranged by the hotel).The photos really don't do this place justice!

1310,"We arrived early at Nefeli Homes and upon arrival were welcomed with the most breath taking view and some coffee and pound cake while we waited for our room to be serviced. Antonia was very helpful with providing us with suggestions of tours we could book, car rentals, and four-wheelers without being pushy (We did the catamaran sunset tour and one-day four wheeler rental, which I recommend). The room we were in was recently renovated and just what we needed for our vacation. A queen size bed, small refrigerator, and a bathroom with a tub. I will say do not plan on watching much TV there because most channels are in Greek, but we didn't travel to Santorini to watch TV, so it was not a big deal. Also Wifi in the cave rooms is not the best, but if you pop outside you are able to have a stronger connection, with an amazing view!Each morning we woke up, took in the view, and ate breakfast (when we woke up in time), which was delicious. With the bargain we received for our nightly rate, we did not have breakfast included, but it was okay because we would sleep in and grab lunch from the Souvlaki spot right off the road for only 2.50 Euro, which was equally delicious. If you are contemplating like I was on whether you should stay in Fira or not, believe me Imerovigli is where you want to be. It is a 20 minute walk on a walking path down to Fira, which we ventured to and from for dinner one night. You feel completely safe and do not have to worry about getting run over by cars. Fira is busy with tourists and people trying to get you to buy things or eat at their restaurants. Each morning we woke up in Imerovigli and stepped outside it was peaceful and you were able to enjoy your surroundings. I almost rented a car, but cancelled last minute and I made the right decision. You do not need a car. The public bus is reliable and runs every 15 mins for less than 2 euro per person. We even used the bus to get to Fira and transfer to the other side of the island to visit Santos Winery, which I highly recommend. All in all, I would stay at Nefeli Homes again in a heartbeat, it was everything I imagined my stay in Santorini would be like.","October 11, 2016","26    Nefeli Homes

Our taxi dropped us off at the main street at about 2130 and we wandered in the dark for at least 30-40 minutes. No one in the area seemed to know anything about its location. Fortunately once we located it- everything was smooth sailing. The hotel is very nice and the location is perfect. They even have a nice convenient store within a very short walk. The room was a little musty, but it is a traditional cave house in the middle of summer so that was no huge deal but it was noticeable. The air condition worked but it wasn't the best. The wifi was also touch and go in our room, but on most of the patios and decks it worked well. Breakfast was plentiful and very good. View was perfect and ambience was unreal.

1316,"My husband and I stayed at Nefeli Homes last year on our belated honeymoon. I wanted to stay in a traditional cave like room that you can only find in Santorini. Wow! The room we had was huge, it included a living room area. The way each cave like room was placed you had total privacy; we even had a balcony area. The view is like none other anywhere. It was awe-inspiring; our hotel was built right into the cliff. Breakfast was served on the terrace overlooking the Aegean Sea and the caldera. . .it was the best home made Greek yogurt we had in our entire time in Greece! To stay in a hotel in Santorini with a view like this would cost a fortune (like in Oia), but Nefeli Homes had the best view at a very reasonable price. It's a family run hotel which we also liked. The only negative aspect would be the pool which was miniscule but you don't go to Santorini for a pool; and the rooms are dark. But you are in a cave after all. And there are a TON of stairs . . up . .down . .just to get around Nefeli Homes, but that just adds to the quirky charm of the place. The owners were very accommodating and friendly; they picked us up at the ferry and let us leave our bags in the office for the entire day after check out before we left Santorini on our last day. AND drove us back to the ferry at midnight! Nefeli Homes also was within walking distance to Fira. My husband and I visited Oia but we actually liked Imerovigli better! Oia was very crowded with the cruise ship people spilling all over the place and felt very touristy; Imerovigli was not like that at all. We also liked it better than Fira . .. which was nice but also very crowded and young. We've done the up-all-night-dancing-and-drinking scene when we were a little younger. Overall, we'd loved our stay at Nefeli Homes and we'd go back the next time we visit Santorini!","December 16, 2015","26    Nefeli Homes

This apartment with two stories gives enough room for 2 to 3 people and the private balcony has one of the best views around. Free Wifi was fast, a big fridge in the room keep your drinks cool and the greek breakfast was every morning served with a smile on the terrace with unobstructed caldera view. The rooms were perfect cleaned every day by a friendly lady as the whole area was very well maintained. Of course you have to keep in mind where you are staying. Space is limited, the rooms are small and you should not be much taller then about 180 cm in this room. The pool is more for a refereshing dip and not for swimming, and other rooms here are more cave-style, that means only one front windows and a darker feeling. But when you are in Santorini, you should not waste your time in the room.

1319,"Keep looking - there are plenty of other places in Santorini that offer a view, without the mouldy, damp, dark, outdated, small, chemical smelling rooms. Pay a bit extra and stay somewhere you can actually enjoy!- The photos and information Nefeli Homes provide are completely misleading! - Pool area is TINY and the pool itself is dirty, and large majority is knee deep.- No management present onsite, only for check-ins.- No information or map provided on the island or area when you check-in. - Looking at where they serve their breakfast, I would not eat here.- They charge your credit card before you arrive.- The room we were located was underneath the pool, with tiny windows, right next to the public walkway, stunk of strong smelling chemicals and had an air conditioning unit full of mould.- Within ten minutes of being in the room my partner and I were feeling very nauseous. We informed the manager and asked if we could please move to a different room and she told us that we could not as the hotel was fully booked. Since they could not offer us another room for tonight, we then asked if we could get a refund so we could stay in other accommodation. She rang her manager who informed us that a refund was not possible.Eveidently it became obvious that there was no way we could stay in the room for 2 nights with the smell making us feel ill and we decided to stay elsewhere.Given these circumstances we thought there could have been a refund given.When we were waiting for our ride to leave, management went down there to assess the room, and the manager acknowledged the smell and condition of the room yet still wouldn't refund a cent.It is completely unacceptable to offer a room of this standard to guests, regardless of the price, however given that we were paying 114€ per night, this was not cheap so we were definitely not expecting a room of this extremely poor standard. We notified booking.com of the situation and they liaised with Nefeli Homes on our behalf but Nefeli Homes still refused to refund us anything. Frankly, this is appalling and we have never experienced customer service like it! ","September 21, 2015","26    Nefeli Homes

1322,We are currently staying here with the family and couldn't wait to write a review.Would highly recommend for both couples and family to stay here the view is incredible and we love overlooking the entire island from our suite. It is situated on top of the cliff and is truly amazing. The suites are quite spacious and beautifully decorated. Breakfast served daily with a smile on the top balcony. The lady in charge Anna is absolutely lovely and a pleasure to deal with.

1324,"It is always hard to find accommodations in Europe for a family with kids since most require you getting two rooms. In Nefeli we had a room with one queen bed and two twin beds which worked great for us. The room had some character, overall we were content with our choice. Imerovigli is no Oia, there is no promenade with shopping but it has great views, good food and warm people.If you want luxury stay at Honeymoon Petra Villas instead.","July 16, 2015","26    Nefeli Homes

This is a family business and they were so warm and hospitable, we instantly loved them. The rooms are all different and very quaint, the place is beautiful. Anna arranged our outings and was spot on recommending places to eat and things to do, we all had an AMAZING time much in thanks to her. We all found the breakfast to be plentiful and delicious, that IS the best yogurt in the world, I miss it so much now!The only reason I did not give it five stars is because the beds were not very comfortable but to tell you the truth if I was to go back to Santorini I would definitely stay there again because of the great service we received!","June 14, 2015","26    Nefeli Homes

Breakfast up on the top balcony overlooking the caldera is worth getting up for. Only a short stroll to restaurants and another walk along the cliff path between the hotels to the town on Thira.

1332,"I can fully agree with all positive reviews below. This place is awesome! The view is one of the best, which we've seen on Santorini - Imerovigli is located much higher than other cities (villages), so the views are really spectacular. Plus it's much less busy here, than in Fira of Firostefani, which makes it a perfect place to relax. Nefeli Homes is located in the centre of Imerovigli, so it's close to everything - to local markets, bus stop (main road), to restaurants and ATM. We also walked to Firostefani and Fira from there (very nice walk). Accomodation offers free airport pickup/dropoff, which is very nice gesture. Breakfast were also very tasty, and you can enjoy them eating on the terrace with gorgeus view. We stayed in Grand View Maisonette, which had 2 floors and its own balcony - we really loved this room! It was very comfortable and spotless clean. The only small disadvantage was poor wifi, but as I read reviews of other hotels, this is quite common in Santorini, so what can one do :) Overall we had perfect stay and would definitely come back again!","May 4, 2015","26    Nefeli Homes

1333,"This hotel is delightful. It is located in a quiet village that is near to the main road, so best of both worlds. It's about 30 minutes walk to the capital Fira and there is also a local bus stop. There are some lovely restaurants within 5 minutes walk - Anogi and Bella Thira are worth a visit - and a couple of supermarkets, coffee places and a pharmacy.The staff are wonderful (Anna in particular) and the breakfast is very tasty. The rooms were cleaned only once we'd left for the day. It was a wonderful stay and no problem was too big or small for Anna. Our room was next to reception and on occasion, we listened to an incredibly patient Anna dealing with what we felt were unfounded complaints.All in all, great stay, good value, brilliant location.","April 19, 2015","26    Nefeli Homes

About 200 mts away there is a bakery open 24 hours, with all fresh and delicious pastries done every day. If you go in the morning you'll see the people making the pastries.

The pool was lovely, great size, bigger than expected (can usually be fooled by hotel photos), very clean, plenty of sunbeds, and a reasonably priced bar besides it. The family who run the place were lovely. Very friendly and spoke good English. The beach is just a stones throw away with a strip full of bars, restaurants and shops. The room is basic, but if you've travelled to Santorini to spend your holiday locked inside your room, maybe this isn't the place for you. There is a locker and fridge inside too. Clean towels and bed linen too, with spacious balconies with tables and chairs.

1346,"I stayed here 7th August 2018 with my fourteen year old daughter for one week and it was ok, but feel it could have been a more enjoyable time but for a few small improvements. I want to say at this point that I am not one to moan usually because you’re not staying for very long so just get on with it. Santorini itself is lovely although we found it to be very windy in Perissa, not just a gentle breeze but almost gale force at times which spoilt it a bit for me, also Santorini Airport is just too small. We queued for ages outside on our departure then queued again at the departure gate because there was no room. About the property: The pool was lovely, nice and warm most days, lots of sun beds always available. The owner of Phevos does provide snacks although there was no menu so you had to ask for what was available, and he seemed to open up the bar for short periods and then disappear for ages so you had to pick your moment to get a snack or a beer. Also none of our doors would shut properly without really shunting them! I was told by the owner about getting sun cream on the white towels, and he moaned about it but when you have a shower that only emits water from a couple of holes then maybe I still had some cream still on me?!! I just think that the place was let down by poor maintenance for whatever reason. We still had a lovely time in Santorini so our holiday wasn’t ruined, just wanted to point out these small annoyances. The food on the seafront and the service was exceptional and we had some lovely meals. Please visit the Chinese restaurant on the main road as the people there were fantastic and food was delicious, we kept going back there! Overall the place was still ok. I wouldn’t return to the island mainly because of the awful airport experience which is a shame because it is very beautiful.","August 15, 2018","27    Phevos Villa

1347,Me and my partner visited Phevos Villas from 26/7 - 02/8. Upon arrival we were slightly unsure of the place with it being a little more basic than we anticipated however we soon realised that we had chosen one of the best hotels in the resort.It was very clean with rooms being cleaned every day with fresh sheets and towels. The pool area was lovely - although not overly big it was one of the biggest in the resort ! We paid €49 for air con for the week which seemed steep but it was a godsend ! We had late night flights and check out was 11.30am but there is a courtesy room to keep cases and get a shower.George the owner seemed to have quite a hard exterior but once we got talking to him he seemed like a lovely guy. There aren’t any pavements in Perissa so just be aware that you have to walk at the side of the road. We tackled this by finding the shortest route down to the beach front and mainly used the bars and restaurants down there (about a 5-10 minute walk from the hotel). If you plan on visiting Fira and/or Oia then I’d recommend getting the local bus down by the magic bus bar on the beach front (this is the first pick up so you should definitely get seats) It’s €2.40 per person to Fira then from Fira onto Oia a further €1.80. Buses are air conditioned and run every 20minutes from early morning until late at night.Hotel was full of really lovely down to earth guests and it has such a friendly atmosphere. Would recommend if you want to go and just relax.,"August 5, 2018","27    Phevos Villa

1349,Arrived back from 2 weeks at phevos villas last week firstly the apartments are in a prime location close enough to the beach returaunts and bars . The rooms are very basic normal traditional greek however the cleanliness is outstanding and on a parr with any 5 star providing clean fresh fluffy towels every day . George the owner is very busy as he has just opened a new hotel in Perissa close to the beach however he always had time for us and is a very approachable host . Due to George being so busy the pool bar wasn’t always open throughout the day however there is no problem taking your own drinks and snacks to the pool . We was originally in room 5 which is a very small room with not much of a balcony therefore we moved to room 10 on our second week which was much more spacious and had a nicer bigger balcony. All in all we thoroughly enjoyed our stay at phevos and would recommend it to anyone looking for a affordable holiday in Santorini .,"July 8, 2018","27    Phevos Villa

Don't expect to be able to cook a 3 course meal as in all Greek self catering there is minimal facilities ie toaster kettle and one portable hob.There is a nice pool area with plenty of sunbeds. There is a small bar where we had a couple of drinks before we went out in the evening where we had a chat with the owners.There is a safe and air con if required for a fee. It's a few minutes walk to the bakery where we bought rolls and cakes for lunch. There are.numerous restaurants and bars on the main road and beach road which is 5 to 10 minute walk. We caught the local bus to Fira which was 2.40 and it was another 1.80 to Oia which is a really pretty place to visitI would definitely recommend this accommodation for it's quiet location and only a short walk to restaurants/beach and also for it's cleanliness . ,"June 18, 2018","27    Phevos Villa

1351,"Just back form a week at Phevos Villas, they are very well located a short walk out of 'town' so are therefore in a reasonably quite area of Perrisa . The pool is a good size and has plenty of comfortable sun beds although they were very little used the week we stayed. George and his wife Hannah aided by their cleaner do a good job of keeping the place clean. The rooms are small but have everything you want including a nice firm mattress on the bed!!! As you would expect on a very small island the tap water is filtered sea water so is an absolute no no for making tea cleaning teeth etc.There is air con and a room safe at a small charge per week which is advisable as there are only ten policemen on the whole island. Couldn't believe the lovely white towels are changed every day and the bed sheets at least twice in our week, well done George but is that really necessary ? Talking about George he is very amiable and friendly if you care to take the time to chat to him and Anna. All in all in was a perfect place to stay on this beautiful and picturess island.Enjoy your stay but be prepared for an awful departure from the smallest and chaotic airport on your return.","June 8, 2018","27    Phevos Villa

1356,"Just arrived back from these apartments after a lovely weeks holiday. The apartments were nice, small but ideal for how long we were in them and cleaned everyday to a high standard. However cannot be said for the owner, although he wasn't horrible, a nice Greek shake of the hand to welcome you and a smile upon arrival would not have gone amiss, not the typical Greek welcome we are accustomed to. Asked if they did breakfast and was told 'no there was only me and he only had a toaster, very difficult when on your own' was his answer! Air con is 6 euro a day so not sure how the previous reviewer got his thrown in? Based on this I would recommend the location and apartments if they had a new owner as it could be a little gold mine, but he appears not to be interested and can associate with other comments how he may pick and choose who he chats to? Sorry will not be returning to these apartments.","September 5, 2016","27    Phevos Villa

1357,"We stayed here as a family 2 adults and 2 children for a week. The hotel is located just a 10 minute stroll from the main centre of perissa with all the shops, bars and restaurants and also the beach. 5 min walk to the nearest local shop and 24 hour bakery (don't miss visiting the bakery as all the foods are great).Our room was small and basic as you expect in Greece with a separate patio area for sitting outside. The room had aircon which was great and not too noisy. It also had a free safe. It had a small kitchen area with full size fridge wth a small freezer compartment, a kettle, a toaster and a plug in 1 ring electric hob. Also provided were plates, cutlery, pots and pans etc for those who want to make up small meals. A nice touch was that washing up liquid a brush and tea towel were also provided. Bathroom was your basic, shower and sink with soap provided also. Could have done with some storage space in here for toiletries with there being 4 of us and a few more towel rails or hooks.The room was clean and well maintained and the cleaner visited daily and made beds and provided clean towels. The beds are very comfy. A great point abouth these apartments are that there are only a few so the pool area is not too busy. We found plenty of spare sun beds at any time of the day and this was in August - they are also very comfy. You get the sun all day around the pool and there are sun brolleys if needed. The pool here is great and a really good size compared to a lot of the hotels. It also has a good shallow end so is perfect for children. There's a pool bar which serves drinks and snacks all day at reasonable prices. Also free wifi around the pool area which is a bonus. You will see a few cats around the area but they keep themseves to themselves unless you call them over.This is a nice quiet accomodation where you really can relax and enjoy your time. And it's not too far from Perissa centre. I would recommend and would also stay again.","September 5, 2016","27    Phevos Villa

1358,"we have been back from Phevos Villas for a week.Our room was basic, but spotless and we had a terrace facing the pool. There are free safes, hairdryer, TV kettle and fridge, The bathroom is small and the shower is quite basic, but it does the job. The pool is cleaned every morning by George and there are plenty of sunbeds, which are lovely and comfortable. I cannot fault the hotel or the staff in any way. George and Anna are busy owners and work very hard ensuring that things are run as smoothly as possible.They both speak English and their son who helps out also speaks good English. The cleaner, who was there most of the day and again we must say was very nice and always ready with a smile.The villas are in great location, with a shop and english is understood and spoken and the YUMMY 24hr bakery 5 minutes walk away.their croissants and ring sugar doughnuts are to die for. We used to buy a baguette (a tip here....the large are the same price as the small ones, so hubby and I shared). There is a wide selection of baguettes to choose from. Cakes, Freshly squeezed fruit juice again yummy. The beach and restaurants are a little further, all in all about 10 minute walk.We ate at a few of the restaurants facing the beach, Aqua was an excellent restaurant with value for money, and friendly staff. Most times we were given a complimentary homemade sweet! :)The local buses are good value for money (not always on time :) but this is Greece). We paid 2.40 euro to go to Thira which takes about 25minutes. The conductors/drivers are friendly and helpful.We will go back here.","August 8, 2016","27    Phevos Villa

1359,"Phevos Villas was recommended to me and what a great recommendation. The hosts, Giorgos and Anna are welcoming and friendly and happy to assist throughout your stay. We stayed in room 18 which was lovely. The rooms are basic but comfortable and come with a small kitchen area complete with kettle and basic crockery. I would suggest that breakfast and snacks are doable but not for cooking a full meal. Giorgos or one of the family is around from early morning until midnight and will happily provide coffee and a snack (Greek salad toast etc.), ice creams are also on sale as well as soft beverages and alcohol. The pool area is great, there were plenty of sun-beds and the pool was lovely. Every day a cleaner came in and changed the towels, bathroom mat, made the bed etc. Giorgos knows the local area well and can advise on things to do; he has a wealth of knowledge. Phevos Villas is a short walk (literally 5 minutes) to Perissa beach where there are loads of restaurants, with something to suit all tastes. Personally we used Scirocco and Gyros Place on several occassions as the food was great and they were not along the ocean view route. As the old adage goes, we found that at several places on the sea front you were paying for the views, as it was certainly not for the quality of the food or service (also only one place seemed to serve fresh fish, the rest was all frozen!) It is just a 5 minute walk from the bus stops where you can get air-conditioned coaches to all the major attractions across the island (some require 2 journeys, changing at Thira). The buses are regular, cheap and easy to use. Having travelled across the island we thought this was a great place to stay, less expensive than Oia, less touristy than Thira, but easy to get everywhere.","July 13, 2016","27    Phevos Villa

1360,"Looking to the pictures and the information in this hotel's web site I though it would be a very nice experience, specially because of the ""hospitality"" they mention every time in their description, but I was wrong. A kid received us when we arrived to the hotel and he just gave us the key of our room. When we asked him about maps or any information he just told us to buy one in the mini market. Also, there was no shampoo or even soap in the shower. WiFi only works at the pool. To finish, the hotel was full of cats and in our last night we couldn't sleep hearing the horrible noises of two cats procreating besides our door. I don't recommend it.","July 6, 2016","27    Phevos Villa

1361,"Phevos villas is a small family run business. Rooms are not the biggest,but they are clean and functional. Cleaned every day , towels changed every day.we were there in June and the room was very hot. I can imagine they would be unbearable in the height off the summer. There is aircon . I think 6euro a day. We had a room by the pool not great late at night if you had gone to bed and there were people drinking at the bar. A tad noisy.Location is good 10 min stroll to the beach. Wonderful 24 hr bakery at the bottom of the road. 5 min walk. Lots of restaurants to choose from all within walking distance.George the host makes a wonderful Greek salad . Very helpful if you need anything.","June 19, 2016","27    Phevos Villa

1362,"We picked Santorini as we had never been there before and this resort and Hotel seemed to tick all the boxes. We requested a quiet room which we we're given and had no complaints, except it was one of the smaller rooms but quite adequate. We visited at the end of August for 14 days. I have taken a while to review this hotel as when I returned two guests we met while we there had written their reviews one very positive one not so good, and they had covered most of the points, I wanted to make. So I will try and be as realistic as I can. This accommodation was in a great location 10 minutes stroll from the resort and beach, the rooms are cleaned and towels and linen replaced daily. The pool area is as good as some 5* boutique hotels I have stayed at, with plenty of good quality sun lounges and a great size pool. I have to agree with others they could make more of the bar and food offer, but George is a lovely man, but maybe not as outgoing as most Greek hotel owners. But as we ate out every night, (except for BBQ night which only happened because some guests had requested they hadn't done one the first week) and only stayed at the pool the first couple of days that so it didn't bother us to much. Although it would have been nice to have a nightcap at the bar when returning, but that wasn't the case, that is my only negative, So expect usual Greek basic rooms with toaster, kettle, TV, A/C (6 euro per night) and shower curtain, Wifi worked on our patio which was upper floor. To finish we loved our return to Greece, Santorini and the Phevos was also great. I would recommend the Phevos to anybody","November 30, 2015","27    Phevos Villa

1363,"Got back from Phevos Villas in Santorini just over a week ago, had a wonderful time and thoroughly enjoyed my stay there. I have never been to Greece before so wasn't sure what to expect but we were made to feel very welcome, I loved the pool (yes that was me fellow guests doing many lengths of the pool every day but I had to earn my baclavas)Our room was lovely and clean with fresh towels every day, cooking facilities weren't great but adequate and lets face it who wants to cook on holiday, George the owner made us feel very welcome, made the most amazing Greek salads and even gave us some of his home grown pomegranate seeds which were lovely. Had a wonderful relaxing time but also managed to explore the Island, visiting Fira and taking a boat trip around the island, swimming in the hot springs and watching the sun set at Oia, all very magical. Thank you Santorini and thank you George and your family for making my first visit to Greece very memorable.","October 16, 2015","27    Phevos Villa

1364,"Just got back from the Phevos hotel and although we enjoyed the holiday the hotel wasn't as good as we'd hoped. We'd paid just over £900 for a week there and though the pool area was clean, pool bar service good and plenty of sunbeds, the room was tiny. There literally wasn't anywhere to put our cases! The cooking facilities were poor and when you opened the cupboard door it smelt of damp. The shower was tiny and Wi-Fi is only around the pool, On the plus side, the rep visits the hotel every day, and the surroundings were quiet. Phevos is a lovely hotel to look at and location is ok. The maid was very good and our room was cleaned and we had fresh towels every day.","September 30, 2015","27    Phevos Villa

1365,"The Greek people are known for their hospitality, love of family and embracing life with relish while remaining grounded and pragmatic. Anna and George epitomise these qualities and this is reflected in their mini ""resort"".They built this bite-size slice of the country themselves and fill every inch of the place with their warm, welcoming and dedicated personalities.Phevos is a fabulously quirky boutique oasis that focuses on the priorities required to enjoy this the most spectacular Greek island at your leisure. The owners deserve the overwhelmingly positive feedback they work so hard to encourage and as for the one or two detractors, by all means feel free to pay many multiples of the cost of your stay by booking infinity pool luxury in Oia next time. But please don't insult these lovely people by demanding five star luxuries when paying the extremely reasonable rates George charges for an awful lot of added value.Highlights:- very friendly which encourages a family feel- stylishly designed yet intimate accommodation- great pool and bar facilities- legendary barbeque- hugely helpful owners who will do everything to make your holiday a success- close to all amenities including the beach, restaurants, fabulous bakeries, bars and commuting points- 30 mins max from the very many attractions the island has to offer- striking setting- relaxing environmentThe epitome of Greece.Top tip - book direct and fly with Easy Jet, daily.Reserve a room by the pool for the best of all worlds.","September 2, 2015","27    Phevos Villa

1366,"Phevos - 6euro a night air con so 84euro in total. We booked for our honeymoon. The owner - George very friendly. Basic rooms quite small but adequate for what you use it for - getting ready and sleeping! Bed and pillows so comfortable. The shower does water the whole floor and is a very small square in the corner, the water is not very powerful. The pool is huge, sunbeds are luxurious. They take in stray dogs so they do come and go round by the pool. There are cats and dogs around that at times drink out of the pool but they don't really keep coming over to you unless you make a fuss of them; which a lot of holidaymakers were keen to do! There are a pile of books you can read/swap by the pool. Pool is open 9-20:00 daily and is so warm (weather is 30 degrees or above daily) in August. It is long with deep and shallow ends - jacuzzi jets down the shallow end. A perfect length for real swimming too. The cleaner is very good - swaps all towels and sheets everyday, mops the floor, empties your bins. The washing line was just outside the door over the trees. No balcony but plastic chairs and table outside near your front door. Some people did have a back and a front door but we only had one. It did get busy in the middle of the holiday but we managed to get a sun lounger. A lot of children/families there which considering Santorini is quite expensive to stay I can see why they stayed at Phevos - it is good value for money. Great location - only a 5 mins or 10 mins very slow walk down to the beach which has lots of restaurants to try. A shop 2 mins walk away and a larger supermarket and 24 hour bakery 10-15 mins walk away.","August 27, 2015","27    Phevos Villa

1368,"I read Caroline's review whilst sat by the pool at the Phevos and started to wonder if she stayed in the same place as I was in.Then I read the last remark about Mythos being a local beer. Hmm, brewed on the mainland by a carlsberg company, available all over Greece and it's on sale in Tesco in the UK and Dan Murphy in Australia.Like many, we have visited a great many Greek Islands over the past few decades staying in studios about the same level as this one. But this accommodation exceeded all our expectations. We arrived late at night and shown our room. What a surprise!An electric kettle and a small coffee pan, a good selection of cooking utensils, two electric cooking plates, one large and one small. Also a toaster!A tea towel (changed daily), washing up liquid and scourer A good fridge with a good freezing compartment and an ice cube tray, took a couple of hours to make ice, about the same as at home.In the bathroom were two rolls of toilet paper (replenished as needed) and soap in a soap dispenser over the sink. A shower curtain as well as sink plugs for both bathroom and kitchen sinks.A bath mat changed daily and two good fluffy towels each. Also a reasonable shower attachment with a good hook to hang it from, not just it by hand.Piping hot water is available 24hours a day, not just in the afternoon.A double bed, made with sheets and bedspread neatly folded for use if you wish, this is, after all, a self catering studio, not an hotel.The towels and sheets were changed daily, every day.A wall mounted TV with working remote, and a wall safe with key provided at no extra charge. And a hairdryer!Yes my mattress was firm, but that suited us, soft mattresses give me back ache.Whilst we have seen all these items in Greek studios over the years this the first time they have all been together in this sort of price range.Outside a good size patio with table and chairs, a good washing line and good pegs.Not as private as some, but more private than many, and why would I want total privacy if I stayed here?The pool area was spacious with plenty of good sun loungers and the pool was clean. This is a credit to George as the red Sahara dust that often settles thickly overnight is hard work to get off the bottom of the pool. Much easier sweeping it off the patios!No George is not on site all the time, although he and Anna live next door. He is a full time school teacher, has a small vineyard and a smallholding as well. Life in Greece at present is very difficult, especially when tour operators are cutting their room rates to owners as well.There was invariably a family member on site all the time. Perhaps in the small office at the side?As I say this week exceeded my expectations and my only disappointment was that I did not need any of the items I carry out from home with me when going to the islands, there were all there already!The Phevos is what it is - a good holiday studio on a Greek island, not an Abu Dhabi hotel.","July 3, 2015","27    Phevos Villa

Pool area and bar is fantastic as is the Saturday night BBQ lots of delicious food! Used the courtesy room on day of departure which is a fantastic addition it meant we could stay by the pool all day and shower before our flight home.

We chose phevos as the pool area is fabulous, with comfy sun lounges and a little shelf at one edge of the pool, perfect for our daughter to stand and walk along. Giorgos and anna are just wonderful hosts, and brilliant with our daughter. They are not over baring like some however approachable. The rooms are basic but very clean, typically Greek and for vale you can not complain. We had room number 2 which has an enclosed ground floor balcony, again prefect for our daughter.One little warning is there are animals about and if you have a real dislike of animals it wouldn't be for you. I would like to add the animals are very friendly and not overbearing though. Enjoyed so much already booked for next year!!! ","June 22, 2015","27    Phevos Villa

The rooms are clean, you have everything you need and the beach is literally 5 mins walk away. As the villas aren't in the centre of the resort they are very quiet and relaxed. The bar serves Mythos and home made wine ( highly recommended) plus all the usual concoctions any Brit holiday maker could want. The menu is limited but everything is tasty.

It has no balcony of its own as most of the others and is a little out on a limb with only morning sunlight. The self catering facilities are very limited but who cooks? The maid service is excellent with clean sheets and towels daily.The pool and pool area are very attractive and well maintained with the obligatory bar ( not always manned).

1373,"We have just returned from a week at Phevos, our regret is that we didn't book for two weeks. We had no idea what to expect prior to our arrival and had read many of the reviews before booking.Holidays and their experiences are entirely subjective. My comments relate therefore only to my and my wife's experience. I can appreciate that Phevos is a little like marmite you'll either love it or hate it depending on what you expect. We loved it. If you require a 4 or 5 star hotel don't bother as you'll be disappointed but if you are happy with basic accommodation with all that you are likely to need for basic self catering then you will not be disappointed.Rooms are basic but very clean. Whoever does the DIY reminds me of my lack of skills in this area, nothing is really square but this for me added to the charm. Rooms are cleaned floors washed daily with a change of towels tea towels and sheets. Considering the price we paid there was nothing that we lacked except perhaps for a blanket on our first night which was quite chilly.You are given the key to the room and left to your devices but this is not a problem we are after all adults, if there are any issues then Georgios and Anna are always available..There is a table and chairs outside of each room for Al fresco for breakfast and plenty of room round the pool and bar area.Anna looks after a number of dogs whom I suspect are strays but these are no problem at all (no more than 3/4 at any one time). They do not bother you and are very docile and are happy for you to stroke them should you wish. If you don't like dogs this may not be a place for you.We found that we were only in our room for sleeping spending most time out and about round the island or round the pool/bar.Georgios and Anna are very approachable but do not intrude upon guests unless you engage them in conversation. We found them, to be very approachable and friendly. Georgios makes his own wine which is well worth tasting. Georgios and Anna also do a weekly barbecue (if sufficient people are interested) which we found to be superb with Annna preparing local salads and side dishes.Phevos is well situated for Perissa only 5 minutes from the beach and less to the bakery. Perissa has all that you require re day to day supplies, although dining out is so reasonable that we only ate in once. There is a lovely walk (uphill) of about an hour to ancient Thira. The site is well worth a visit.Buses run reasonably regularly from Perissa to Fira and from Fira which acts as a hub to most other places on this most beautiful island.All in all we loved the place, yes you can see areas that could be improved but as a clean relaxing but basic venue We honestly could not complain. Still you can always always pay twice as much if not more for that 4 or 5 star experience. We will be booking again but next time for 2 weeks.","May 22, 2015","27    Phevos Villa

1374,"Accommodation - Rooms - Studios (2) consists of small kitchenette, sleeping area, bathroom and balcony or terrace. The rooms contain tv, hairdryer, dressing table with mirror (not full length), Small coffee table. Wardrobe with two drawers and internal shelf. Dressing table also has drawers.safe box with key, bedside tables and lamps, french doors to balcony or terrace and door shutters to block out all light. The kitchenette contains kettle, toaster, two plug in electric hobs (one is very small for a coffee pot and the other is large enough for a pan) Fridge with ice compartment, sink, and inside the cupboards you will find large lidded pot or saucepan, frying pan, collander, utensils, bread knife, cutlery inc. Bottle opener/corkscrew, chopping board, mugs, cups and saucers, two soda glasses (No wine glasses), pasta bowls, dinner plates, side plates. They do also provide washing up liquid, handsoap and tea towels and washing up sponges. The rooms do come with an air conditioning unit however it comes at a charge of 6 euros per night. Studio for three is exactly same but has 3 beds and if only two of you in there it makes ideal day sofa.Facilities - pool side bar/snack bar serving a limited menu of snacks; greek salad, cheese and ham toastie or omelette. Usually open all day until sometime between 11pm-12 midnight. There are plenty of chairs and tables. There of course is a pool which is fairly large and 2.5 metres deep at deep end. It is unheated (freezing) however . Location - Phevos Villas are in a very good location. Approx 500 metres to the beach and about 100 metres to the nearest convenience store. It is also ideally located for Ancient Thira, the pathway to which is literally about 100 metres further up from the accommodation. This accommodation is close enough to the town for access but away from it enough to have peace and quiet. There are supermarkets and a 24 hour bakery within 5 - 10 minutes walk, however I thoroughly recommend a second 24 bakery located further away called 'Santa Irini' Bakery located about 20 - 25 minutes walk along the 'Main Road', which also happens to be next to a big supermarket named 'Coops'. There is a much greater selection in these stores.Staff - Owned and run by a husband and wife team of whom are very picky and choosy who they are nice to. We found them to be unwilling, unhelpful, miserable and unprofessional. Never seen such unwelcoming and unhappy looking people.Food - pool side bar/snack bar serving a limited menu of snacks; greek salad, cheese and ham toastie or omelette.This accommodation does look very pretty from the outside but inside is not so good…here are a few negatives.Negatives - The Phevos Villas does not have a reception area. On arrival we stood around by the entrance until out name was called by the owner, George. There was no 'Welcome' or 'Hello'. Just a stern calling out of our surnames, then one by one we were lead to our room and keys shoved into our hand and that was it. If you had issues during the week you literally had to search the area for George, although some of the time you will find him sat at the bar watching his guests around the pool…slightly uncomfortable. Generally there appears to be an avoidance of maintenance issues. You will see when you arrive. The rooms are poorly maintained such as loose light fittings, loose wiring, dangerous appliances (i.e. kettles that heat the handle up as they go), sharp nails sticking out of the floor ready to impale your foot, broken fixtures and fittings etc etc. Also a note regarding housekeeping. Be prepared to make your own beds every day and hang up your own towels and put down your own bathmats. The housekeeper on a daily basis will strip your beds and then dump sheets and towels on your unmade bed and then leave you to do the rest! I have stayed in some dodgy accommodation before but have never experienced this before. Patio furniture wasn't cleaned prior to our arrival so we had to clean it before sitting down as it was covered in about a cm of grime and dirt.Very important note regarding the rooms - the walls and ceilings are PAPER THIN. You can literally hear absolutely everything in the room above or next door. SO if you like any peace and quiet avoid this hotel at all costs. All the rooms are pretty much the same. I did discover however that room number 10 doesn't have any upstairs neighbours and has a private balcony so is a good one for 'some' peace and quiet.On the subject of balconies and terraces - each rooms has their own outdoor patio chairs and table. HOWEVER, the layout is a weird one. The windows of other peoples rooms open out onto other peoples terrace or balcony. So you never really have complete privacy as you always have someones window opening out into your space. In one particular room there was a terrace that no fewer than four other rooms windows opened out onto - can you imagine the noise? Regarding the beds - WARNING - They are like CONCRETE SLABS. They were so bad I considered buying a lilo to sleep on so I didn't wake up in desperate pain each day. The beds were so hard I woke up with bruises all over my body pretty much every day. So if you do decide to stay here - bring your own bed!!Tips - This accommodation is a very basic accommodation and is a good location and provides basic needs but if you want accommodation with any standards then choose an alternative.The walk to Ancient Thira is worth the effort for the views from the top. But do wear decent walking shoes. It is very rocky/loose terrain. Also try one of the local beers 'Mythos'.","May 19, 2015","27    Phevos Villa

1377,"Stayed at Phevos for 2 weeks (August 2014) with Thompson!Georgio & Anna were very friendly, with heaps of assistance for trips, taxis and did a superb line in Greek Salad, not to mention the sumptuous barbecue on a Saturday evening.We had 8 in our group 5 adults and three youngsters, who staying the excellent pool for as long as they possibly could... Daily.The rooms were basic and clean, with minimal catering facilities, but a very useful fridge. The hair dryer was good, but we did not try the air con (for which there is a daily charge) there is maid service daily and of a good quality. However the one drag was the place looked dated, it needs a bit of a makeover, which hopefully will happen when the current Thompson contract expires.If we decide to go back to Santorini, Phevos will be at the top of the list to revisit","September 3, 2014","27    Phevos Villa

1378,"First time staying in Phevos Villa early July and couldn't recommend it more as a base to explore a beautiful island. Staying as a group of four 21 year old girls we wanted a relaxing holiday on a picturesque Greek island after finishing University, Phevos Villa provided a basic yet very clean and welcoming style. Rooms were spotlessly cleaned everyday of our stay (towels also changed daily). Although hiring a car, therefore not always staying within the hotel area in the daytime, we found the pool area to be relaxing and clean, with the occasional visit from the hotel's furry friends. We didn't particularly mingle with the owners however we found George to be very helpful if needed.Perissa is a lovely beach location with a variety of restaurants and bars. I strongly recommend visiting the wonderful towns of Thira and Oia, Oia being a personal favourite for the views of Santorini's famous sunsets!","August 28, 2014","27    Phevos Villa

1379,"The only good thing is that it is 10 minutes walking from the beach of Perissa.After that:- It is mainly a hotel that host tour operator groups. It is not very appealing.- They asked to pay the room the day before that we were leaving.- The room was not very clean. - There was not curtain in the shower so this was terrible. - There was a dog around the swimming pool area, lying down on the hammocks and drinking from the swimming pool.- The tap water in this area is awful.I will not stay here again.","August 14, 2014","27    Phevos Villa

Our room had a safe, hair dryer, fridge, and kitchen utensils. there was also a small table right outside in a little personal courtyard which was excellent for eating dinner in the evening. The pool area is lovely and relaxing and the bar is reasonably priced. George and Anna take good care of you! Definitely try one of George's poolside barbecues as they are excellent!It's only a short walk to the beach, shops, restaurants and bus stop and has a small shop and a lovely bakery right near the hotel.There is also a lovely poolside view of the mountain where you can climb, drive or take a donkey ride to visit the ruins of Ancient Thera.

1383,We stayed at the Phevos Villas June/July for two weeks. Recent reviews are pretty accurate - the good ones anyway. We also found the rooms very clean if a little compact. This was a return visit to Santorini after 7 years and it hasn't changed at all. The hotel has a lovely pool but there is a short walk (about 10 mins) to the beach where most sunbeds are free if you use their attached taverna. Rob walked up the hill most mornings but I only climbed to Ancient Thira ruins after hiring a car (the road takes you so far up on the Kamari side). Go up the hill to the ruins or church etc. in the morning when the church is still in the shade and take plenty of water and a hat - you can always hitch a ride on a pony! Beware that it gets quite breezy and so disguises the sun's power. We hire a car from Stavros for £25 a day. Hope to return one day.

1386,"Nice quiet location, 10 min's to Perissa front where there are plenty of restaurants & bars.Rooms are very basic & only one electric ring and just a few item of crockery, but they are kept spotlessly clean by the hardest working chambermaid we have encountered.The appartments are all different in that some have a very nice terrace / balcony area, sadly we drew the short straw, room 16 having no real outside space so if you had wanted to cook you really had no where to eat other than a table & chairs on the walkway.The pool area is very nice with plenty of sunbeds along with a lovely view of the mountain.The local bakery is fabulous & there is a co-op supermarket 20min's walk away.Local buses are a good way to get around & are both reliable & good value, you can see all of the major attractions by using them.Parts of Perissa are a little run down but then again many Greek islands have areas that are, Perissa certainly has a very relaxed feel & at no time did you feel threatened or un safe.Would we stay at Phevos again ?, yes but not in room 16 !!.","June 24, 2014","27    Phevos Villa

The owners helped us a lot with tourist information and recommendations of places to visit and guided excursions, and they also managed our transfer from/to the port.

1391,I've read quite a few reviews which wax lyrical about how friendly George is however all I can say is that his happy pills must have run out by the end of the season as we found him a real misery.Admittedly a faulty lock resulted in being locked in the room the first morning which required the attendance of a locksmith (complete with hammer) but all Georgie boy did was huff and puff and complain about the price of electricity from that point on.Anyway on the positive side # the rooms are basic but very clean (cleaned every day by the brilliant maid).# the pool area and pool are small but comfortable and clean.# the location is ideal for the beach and restaurants.Regarding the resort and island# the island definitely has the wow factor regarding dramatic views.# there are plenty of good bars and restaurants.# the food is fabulous.# the locals are absolutely fantastic (except Georgie boy obviously).Will we go back - to Santorini definitely - to Phevos villas (not unless George starts taking the happy pills) - by the way George if you read this unfortunately we all need to pay tax mate - get on with it!!,"October 12, 2013","27    Phevos Villa

My only two issues: The bathroom shower is very small, with no curtain, so gets pretty wet in there. And the one bedroom has a case of shelves, but would have liked to have a few hooks on the walls to hang things up, but the walls are the whitewashed plaster, so maybe that is not possible.

1400,"Our family of 5 (including three adult children ages 22, 21, 18) had the most wonderful time at the Prekas Apartment. The location is perfect--since it's a little bit away from the main towns, it's quieter and not as densely populated, but also easily walkable to Imerovigli and Fira. We loved getting croissants, cheese, and fruit from the little convenience store in town for breakfast and eating on our private terrace, taking in the view. We were lucky enough to have an apartment right on one of the pools, so it felt like our own private pool--without the price! However, what really set Prekas was the service of the staff, especially Svetlana. Svetlana gave us dinning recommendations, making the reservations for us, often getting us a discount. That would've been enough, but she did even more. 24 hours before our arrival, we decided to renew our vows for our 25th wedding anniversary. Svetlana got us in contact with a wedding planner and helped decorate our terrace for the small ceremony, taking pictures of us throughout. It was an incredibly special moment that wouldn't have been possible without Svetlana's care. We can't wait to come back in the future!","August 26, 2018","28    Prekas Apartments

The views are amazing and the sunsets are spectacular. It’s a quieter place to stay, but not too far from Oia and Fira. It’s a bit of a walk from the drop-off point, but someone will be waiting for you to bring your bags down to the apartments and there will be someone to take your bags back up at the end of your stay. The staff were all very helpful and obliging. The pool is set at the bottom of the apartments so it’s a bit of a climb back up if you’re not fit!! Breakfast can be ordered or there is a mini mart not too far away where you can purchase your own items if preferred. There is also a very good restaurant near the drop-off area.

They even have a coffee percolator.The pool is small but clean and private from passing traffic. It but must be one of the closest pools to the water and seems to almost hover over the cliff.We loved our early morning 8km walk along the spine of the island to Oia.

1405,"Bottom line up front: Absolutely amazing experience. Wouldn't recommend anywhere else.-Hospitality: All of their staff were super friendly and helpful throughout our stay, but perhaps the best example I can give is this. We checked out of our room at noon on the day of our departure flight, but the flight wasn't until midnight. We spent some time in the nearby towns and shops, but there was only so much we could do and had spent all of our money since we were leaving. When we went back to re-confirm our airport shuttle, they also saw we were wiped out and without hesitation gave us water, watched our luggage, and allowed us to sit in the shade for hours for our shuttle even though we'd already checked out.-View, location, etc: Fantastic view of both the caldera and evening sunsets. At the edge of Imerovigli, so it is nice and secluded, yet not out of the reach by any means. We stayed at the superior studio room and loved it, but all of their rooms had great views and balconies.-Catch/Cons: The following two ""cons"" are simply my own estimations as to why this impeccable gem was within a price I could afford.1. You must throw away toilet paper instead of flushing it (old sewage system). This issue is true all over Santorini, but the high-end hotels pump their sewage periodically so that their patrons don't have to make this small adjustment.2. The shower was small, but unless you're 7' tall or weigh 300 lbs you'll be fine. Plus, there's the pool they chlorinate daily.","June 19, 2018","28    Prekas Apartments

My wife’s luggage did not arrive on her flight and owner Nektarios and his manager Lefteris were on to it for us calling the airport and reassuring us that the bag would turn up soon – and 24 h later it did. It’s the little things like this and such as the complimentary glasses of cold wine we were provided on arrival and during our stay that make for a wonderful and memorable travel experience. The location of the apartments in Imerovigli is perfect being about 2 km from Fira and situated on the walk that circumscribes the Caldera from Fira to Oia. This location is far enough away from the overrun tourist towns of Fira and Oia such that it is peaceful and quiet. We spent our 4 nights in a standard apartment which was quite basic but comfortable, quiet and clean and had a spectacular view of the Caldera and the magnificent sunset! We were very happy with our 4 days at the Prekas apartments, the price was reasonable when compared with other similar establishments and we would certainly go back should we find ourselves fortunate enough to visit Santorini in the future.

1409,"The amount of money that I paid for a room in Prekas Apartments was absolutely overpriced for our room/the accommodation. We came from Mykonos before visiting Santorini where we paid half of the price with a much nicer room/modern accommodations, free airport transfers, free breakfast and staff available until midnight. there were ants crawling all over the floor (if you looked down quickly you could spot 6/7 at one moment.) there were dead/live roaches on the walls/floor. The extra comforter provided was stained. The shower curtain had brown stains. The shower itself was worse than showers I’ve used in hostels. I would not stay here agan nor would I recommend it. Prekas also denied me any sort of refund for the unsatisfactory stay.","May 13, 2018","28    Prekas Apartments

Andreas carried our bags down the many steps and also showed us where to park which was great.The view from all the rooms is amazing, we had the superior studio which is right over the pool which was very quiet and felt like our own most of the time! Beautiful views over the caldera, short walk to restaurants, and 25 mins into Fira. Right on the coastal path so perfect location. On leaving we realised our car had a flat battery, Nico made some calls and within 5 minutes his friend arrived with a charger and we were off to the airport on time. Amazing service!

Breakfast on the balcony was the best we found and certainly the best value. Sadly we had to leave early for a family emergency.

Nico at the front desk was best concierge I've ever met. He was enthusiastic and professional. He gave us great recommendations for lunch and dinner and treated us like V.I.P.'s.The apartments are pretty nice except for the shower. It wasn't top notch.

1416,"We've just spent a week at Prekas Apartments and it has been lovely. I'd chosen to book because of the excellent reviews and they are all absolutely correct! We had room 6 which is one of the smaller rooms, but it had a glorious view over the caldera and we spent many evenings snacking on cheese and wine on our shared balcony. The pool area is good - the pool itself is lovely and deep, and really refreshing in the summer heat. It can get a little crowded but only because some other guests insist on claiming the sunbeds with the best view early in the morning and then not using them for hours! However this is not a flaw of the hotel themselves who were warm and welcoming from the outset, and we still always managed to get a space by the pool, spending many lazy afternoons there.the hotel also provide pool/beach towels which was great and a real help.Before arrival I was emailing Chryssa on reception (who we understand has now left) about dinner options in Imerovigli for a special birthday meal for my boyfriend and her recommendation of Mezzo was perfect; we had an incredible meal with a perfect view - one to remember! Staff were similarly helpful when we asked them to make us dinner reservations at Anogi, as well booking us airport transfers. A huge thank you to Andreas for meeting us on arrival at the top of the hill & carrying our bags up and down the stairs -wonderful service exemplified again.Despite being self catered apartments, the maid service everyday was great, especially when she washed up our plates! We can't thank her enough for this as those tiny things made our holiday so much more enjoyable. A couple of things to be aware of:1) you will need to provide your own water - the tap water we understand isn't suitable for drinking. There are lots of supermarkets and a little mini supermarket just up the hill from Prekas and it's about 1 Euro for a large bottle.2) brings your own toiletries; they provide some soap but that is all.All in all, we loved our stay here and hope to come back someday... fantastic value for money with a view that is shared by many of the more expensive hotels nearby.","August 5, 2017","28    Prekas Apartments

The pool was medium sized and hangs off the edge of the caldera! The lady at reception was so kind and welcoming, she recommended great restaurants to eat at which are so close to the hotel and helped us numerous times with bus routes from the nearby bus stops.

1418,"When researching hotels on Santorini, it became apparent that a ""caldera view"" hotel (hotel on the side of the rim of an old volcano) was desirable in that it allowed the spectacular views to be appreciated most conveniently. As a result, ""caldera view"" were priced at a premium. After having stayed in a caldera view hotel (Prekas) I can say that the convenient view is very nice and worth it if you can afford it, but that there are so many opportunities to enjoy the caldera view away from the hotel that you could still enjoy the full Santorini caldera experience without being in a caldera view hotel. So dont feel like you are missing anything if you choose a less expensive option.We booked almost a year out. Prekas was on the lower price end of caldera view hotels, but it was still over $250 per night. It seemed to strike a balance between the lowest cost possible and an authentic Greek looking caldera view hotel that met the minimum comfort standards. We started a disadvantage because we were looking for a family room for 4, but Prekas did have a large room/suite that fit 4 very comfortably. The room was large and had two private rooms within it, which was great. It also had a kitchenette with a stove and refrigerator in it, which were nice to have. Overall, the room was very spacious.The staff at the hotel was very friendly and helpful. Chrissie, behind the front desk, was very helpful and nice. The guy who helped with the luggage was also very helpful. And you will definitely need his help. The hotel rooms are spread up and down the side of a steep hill, and the only vehicle access is from a parking lot that is well above the hotel. there is a ""long way"" to the hotel which involves a more gradually sloping walkway with some steps in it. Getting luggage up this will still require some serious lifting and struggle. There is also the ""short cut"" which involves going around a locked gate and down a long flight of steep stairs (some with big gaps in them) with a little bare mountain path thrown in (all unlit at night). If you have problems with stairs, this is not for you. Dont even think about carrying your luggage on the short cut. Some of the rooms require using even more steep staircases. There is a guy who will transport all of your luggage at the hotel though, so all you have to do is walk. The hotel itself is in the beautiful, whitewashed Greek style and blends in with the adjoining buildings and is very picturesque. The views are spectacular and equal to any on the island, with a clear view of the sunset. The Imerovigli location is fine and seemed better to me than the Fira location because it was much more quiet and peaceful, but other people may prefer the convenience and activity of Fira. There were plenty of dining options available in the area (Prekas does not have a restaurant), although generally they were not as convenient as what Fira can offer. The closest options would be near the parking lot (where a convenience store is also located), and more options are available in the nearby town (where there are also bigger supermarkets), which is in fairly easy walking distance, although it is an uphill walk going there. The hotel has a small pool. One thing that was not clear from the website concerns the views. Our room was directly above the reception area. It is in the website photos, and shows two separate bedrooms withing the main room, although I cant remember the number. In our area, there were about three rooms clustered around one caldera/sunset viewing area, which made things a little awkward. There was no clear delineation as to which room had which viewing area, so there was the potential for conflicts between rooms over the best viewing area. We never had any conflicts and were able to use the best area, but it was definitely not in complete privacy from our neighbors. I understand that some rooms may have private viewing areas.On the negative side, the room was uncomfortably damp and humid inside it (apparently due to the cave-like construction), although it did have an air conditioner and a couple of humidity reduction devices in the room. This was not unbearable and the room did not seem moldy, but if you are sensitive to this, you should know. No one in our party complained about it. Another negative was the bathroom. It was tiny and the shower did not have any shower curtain and was extremely small and cramped. By the time you showered the whole room was wet. Toilet paper could not be flushed in the toilet, as is apparently true in most of Greece.Overall, I would give the room and hotel a good/better than average rating, largely based on the big space and the great view, although you should remember that for Santorini, this may be considered to be more of a budget hotel. It is a true caldera view hotel, and if that is your top priority, then this will fit the bill at one of the better prices, although it may not have all of the comforts that you would expect for an equally priced hotel that was not on the caldera. I would return.","July 8, 2017","28    Prekas Apartments

1419,"This was a very great place to stay! Imerovigli is between Fira and Oia and is a much lest congested area so it is more peaceful!

It has a little kitchenette and free wifi as well! Not much in the way of toiletries, so take your own, but the VIEW makes this SO worth it! The taxi or shuttle bus will drop you off at the parking area and you will take the stone path down and then dogleg back down again to reach it, so be prepared for a little bit of a hike! There are some shortcut stairs to the left of the path, but they are pretty treacherous, so I would advise only going up them and only in daylight!","June 24, 2017","28    Prekas Apartments

1428,"I apologize in advance; this review is long overdue. I rented 8 of the 9 rooms at beautiful Prekas Apartments this past May when my daughter celebrated her nuptials. We live in Texas and the groom was from Australia. We had guests and family converging on the beautiful village of Imerovigili from all corners of the globe. First off, let me say this it is not an easy task to try and book an entire hotel 6 months before your arrival date. After many failed attempts to contact other properties, I struck gold when I reached out to Nektarios, the owner of Prekas apartments. Mr. Prekas communicated with me very promptly via email and I was able to quickly book all rooms. Of course when we got very close to arrival, many of our guests needed to make adjustments to their reservations. It was quite complex but Mr. Prekas was both patient and efficient in accommodating all the changes. The property itself is quite spectacular and as I anticipated, it became the main meeting spot for our wedding party of 40. We shared many meals and happy times during the week on the balcony of over the office. We even performed the wedding rehearsal on the roof of one of the rooms! I have to confess that we were a bit loud and made quite a mess on a few occasions. Thomas, who not only carried all our bags down the 200 or so steps from the parking area, also cleaned up after us with nothing but a nod and a kind word. Lastly, I have to personally thank Chryssa, she is not only one of the nicest most genuine people I have ever met, but she was an integral part of making our week at Prekas a dream. Chryssa helped us rent scooters and 4 wheelers, helped with transportation and ordering food in from the best spots! Each room at Prekas is a unique gem and matched the exact needs of all of our quests. The location is just perfect. It is a way from the bustle and crowds of Thira, but just a short walk or 4 wheeler ride away to the action. We had many young people in our group and they partied the nights away in Thira and always came back to the rest and relaxation of the Prekas Apartments. If I could give it 10 stars I would. Cheers to a great job! We will be back....without the other 38 people!","August 2, 2016","28    Prekas Apartments

1429,"I stayed a week at Prekas Apartments,and I've literally had the best holiday in my life here where everything surpassed all my expectations!Nektarios the owner,and the staff Chryssa,Anna and Petros were all so helpful and attentive to my every needs.The sunsets from Imerovigli is the best on the island as it occupies the highest ground,and is situated between the towns of Oia and Fira.The one thing to note though on the caldera side of Santorini is that the paths lining the cliffs are thick cobblestone paths;so bring some hiking shoes,because if you try to undertake the walks here with moccasins or flip-flops,you'll feel the thick cobblestones right through the soles.Prekas Apartments is a good location in that one can visit nearby Oia on one side,or Fira on the other side (also Amoudi Bay ia memerising ).The walk from Imerovigli where Prekas apartments are located to Fira takes about 20 minutes;and it so worth doing this walk(both day and during night time) due to the endless photo opportunities that present themselves...breathtaking views.The hike from Imerovigli to Oia takes between 2 to 3 hours on loose dirt/rocky paths up steep inclines and hills.Though i did it in 1 hour and 50 minutes being very fit.If you'll miss your gym routines whilst holidaying here,going on this hike in the hot sun is a perfect alternative;and the challenge of the walk is thoroughly satisfying .Whilst in Oia,don't miss going to the world famous Atlantis Book Shop (why the name Atlantis you say?that's because Plato's myth of Atlantis is based on the Minoan Civilization right here in Santorini.If you want achingly beautiful views,serenity,relaxation and brilliant service,you can't go past Prekas Apartments.A big thank you to Nektarios,Chryssa,Anna and Petros,i will be making this hotel the hotel that i will stay each time i come back to Santorini! Also,as a poet,writer and artist for varying magazines,this spot has fueled my creativity,so if you're a Bohemian,this is the island for you.Regards, Nikos","July 29, 2016","28    Prekas Apartments

1430,"We stayed at Prekas for four nights as a treat and finishing up our 5 week holiday in Greece. Wow what a way to finish. I was not sure what to expect as there are views and there are views. Prekas apartments has complete, unobstructed views of the Caldera, Every Room! it is in a privileged location where there are no hotels under, no power lines and every balcony has a view. This hotel is well thought out, keeping in mind aesthetics, for instance every apartment has their own drying rack for towels tucked away in the corner out of sight so you don't see cloths being dried on people's balconies. This makes for a much prettier backdrop when relaxing by the pool, or sipping a local wine watching the sun set. Breakfast was amazing, and i would recommend eating at the hotel, as there are not many places in the immediate location (Imorevigli) When we wanted breakfast we would call reception and they would prepare and deliver it on our balcony. Completely relaxed and delicious, with plenty of variety. Rooms were cleaned daily as well as any food/ mess we may have left our on our balcony. What i would have to say was the stand out was the service, both reception and the porter were amazing. The porter carried two large suitcases and one overnight bag all by him self up and down the steep narrow stairs to our room with no effort at all, the guy is amazing. He certainly went above and beyond what was expected from him. Anything we asked the reception was no trouble at all, from organising taxis/transfers, to organising a load of washing. The pool was at the lowest level of the hotel with views of the Caldera. The pool itself was large enough, however there is only room for 6 lounge chairs and can get full quickly. This was not a problem for us as we explored the island and did not spend that much time at the pool, however if you plan to just sit at the pool all day, you may have problems.All in all this was an amazing experience in Santorini.","July 16, 2016","28    Prekas Apartments

Amazing!I really enjoy the location and the views are the best on the island, seriously!! It is so quiet and quaint. The pool is like having a private resort. The walk to Fira town is about 15 to 20 minutes and gives you such an amazing view of the island there and back! If you want a high quality stay with not paying a arm and a leg for the same experience stay at Prekas Apartments!!","June 7, 2016","28    Prekas Apartments

1433,"I had booked Prekas thanks to all the TA reviews and they matched the service, view and the overall feel perfectly. I had booked a cab to pick us from the airport through Prekas which was very handy. The pool was away from the street which was much better than the other pools we saw on the street. The main bus stop & the supermarket shops are not too far away. Just a 5-10 minutes walk away. Our room was very spacious (with a well maintained kitchenette), had a spectacular Caldera & Pool view, was quite close to the pool and was maintained perfectly.The lady who serviced the rooms and the guy who moved our luggage were both very courteous and always had a smile! The sunset view from our room was way too awesome and for us much better than the crowded & over-rated Oia sunset view. We had a spacious balcony with a table & 2 chairs; we enjoyed our breakfast and evening coffee everyday there! I am really happy I made the decision to stay at Prekas for our 4 days in Santorini. We had a peaceful. comfortable and brilliant stay. Highly recommended. GO FOR IT!","September 27, 2015","28    Prekas Apartments

1434,"We choose Prekas for our honeymoon stay in Santorini in September. For our room we choose the Captain's Suite. While a little more pricey this recently renovated room is lovely and well worth it. It also includes an in unit jacuzzi and a private balcony at the highest level with a gorgeous view of the island (see pic). The views from Prekas were fantastic. The receptionist/day-to-day manager Chryssa was great providing us with a basic overview of the island on our first day with maps and suggestions. She also assisted us in booking a catamaran trip, which was one of the highlights of our stay. Breakfast was also provided quickly to the room or to the private balcony upon request and room service was excellent. While a little chilly (it was September) the pool was also great and was actually pretty refreshing after laying out in the sun for a while. Prekas is a little far (~30-45 mins) from Fira and a good hike from Oia but we preferred the quiet and the great views in Imerovigli and there are plenty of restaurants and a market close by. Overall we had a wonderful stay and would definitely choose Prekas again!","September 20, 2015","28    Prekas Apartments

1435,We went to Prekas in June and absolutely loved it. The most stunning view from a balcony virtually anywhere in the world. The rooms were basic but who wants to stay in your room?! And value for money was brilliant compared to other places next door! The staff were friendly - nothing was too much bother. If you want to see the sunset in Santorini from your balcony with a glass in your hand for a sensible amount of money then look no further. Very pleased with our stay.,"September 14, 2015","28    Prekas Apartments

1436,"What can i say! totally brilliant.We booked with Prekas for our honeymoon and immediately Mr Prekas e mailed us and offered to collect our luggage from our respective hotels ( we stayed apart the night before) so that it was waiting for us when we arrived. He also arranged to collect us from our reception at the end of the evening. No charge for any of this so thankyou Mr Prekas. When we arrived he personally escorted us from the vehicle down to the apartments. You have two choices when going down to the apartments, one is to take the slightly rough steps (these are greek authority owned so no fault of Mr Prekas) these are quite steep but we took them anyway while he shone his torch for us. Alternatively you can take the longer route which is only a minute or so longer but less steep and in better condition. We booked the best room which was the captains suite and it was fantastic with its own private terrace at the top of the apartments. The view is simply amazing :) Our room was immaculate and the cave bathroom with Jacuzzi was lovely. The level of service was also impeccable, breakfast was huge and served every day Immediately upon ordering (within 5 minutes as they make it fresh) The maid was brilliant and kept everything super clean each day. To give an example one day I was sitting out on the terrace and the sun was baking down on the patio and i saw a small patch of flaking paint. This didnt concern me as it was hardly anything at all. I went inside and when i came back out two guys were there scraping the patio and then they repainted the entire patio which baked dry in ten minutes in the hot sun and it looked perfect again. At other hotels they would of left it as a winter job. I also saw the man coming round and re painting all the plant pots white and any slight change of colour on the walls to keep it all perfect. Just quality of service and most appreciated. Chryssa on reception was fantastic also. One night we ordered a food delivery and Mr Prekas ordered it for me and because he did not like the fact they were charging too much for beers gave me some free of charge! We spent nine nights here and i could of spent months it was that good. Also the pool is unique and kind of hangs off the caldera and is the only one like it in Imerovigli.It was super quiet and relaxing and has amazing views also.Thankyou Mr Prekas or should i say Nektarios, we will defintiely be back more than once :)","September 8, 2015","28    Prekas Apartments

1437,"We were so glad we stayed at Prekas. It is an oasis of calm amidst the turist fan fair that Thira/Imeroglivi have become without compromising an excellent view of the caldera. Really, there's no need to go anywhere else for a beautiful sunset: every room has a gorgeous and obstructed view straight into the sunset. Definitely better in real life than in pictures.

1438,"Can I be back there right now please? This spot is seriously heavenly. The views, the views, oh the views. The views from the pool lounge were so good I was giggling with relish thinking how lucky I was. Our room was one of the smaller ones (standard double--there were only a couple left when we booked!) but it was comfortable and clean and the window opened up to the white stucco and royal blue VIEW! Someday I will go back and bring friends and family to this special place and stay at Prekas again. Chryssa at the front desk was especially helpful and kind, and would help us in calling to make us dinner reservations and all sorts of things. The location is great--you can walk into the small town of Imerovigli and there are a few restaurants walking distance, but we rented an ATV (recommend to see the island easily!) and cruised into Fira and Oia for dinner. It's nice going back to the quieter town though at night--so peaceful. STAY HERE!","August 25, 2015","28    Prekas Apartments

1441,"We stayed at Preka's for 3 nights as part of our honeymoon. We stayed in the small studio, which has a bed slightly smaller than a double bed, but it was perfect for us. We were paying a fraction of the price for the prime piece of real estate the hotel is located on! The views are incredible from the balconies of the hotel as and the pool area, although small, was perfect to relax around after a busy day. Preka's is located in a quiet area in Imerovigli, which we much preferred to the hustle and bustle of Oia & Fira. I've read a few reviews of complaints regarding privacy of the hotel, however wherever you stay in Santorini, you are bound to have tourists walking around your hotel and past your balcony as they are all pretty much built on top and around each other on the edge of the cliff! It is inevitable there will be people around your hotel! However, at Preka's in Imerovigli, it is so quiet compared to the Oia & Fira, there barely is anyone walking along the footpath, even in the peak holiday season of July! So disregard the negative reviews and book here if you're looking for great value, great views of the Caldera and a quiet relaxing holiday.","July 27, 2015","28    Prekas Apartments

1443,"Perfect from when we arrived until we departed. The location in our opinion is the best along the stretch of coast, it is slightly away from Fira but easy to get to and easy to visit the other towns by foot, quad bike or car. Plenty of parking, we would recommend hiring some transport, such as a quad bike (only 30 euro/day) and driving around the coast and to the wineries. Absolutely amazing for sunset - completely unobstructed view. Staff were incredibly accommodating, nothing was too much trouble and very friendly. Even provided an assistant at 5am to help move or bags to the transport. The room was spotless and serviced every day and has simple facilities for making some food or drinks if you wish - e.g. we put together a platter of food for lunch and mixed some drinks to enjoy on the balcony with the beautiful view. Made our trip to Santorini very special.Only criticism, and it was absolutely no issue for us, is that the inner decor is a tiny bit dated in appearance. Some people may not like this if they are more familiar with decor in upmarket hotels, or looking for a luxury experience (eg. on a honeymoon/wedding) Nevertheless, while dated in appearance it is all in excellent condition and extremely clean. The outside appearance of the buildings and the balconies and pool area is immaculate and very well presented.You will not regret booking this accommodation if you are looking for outstanding value!","June 23, 2015","28    Prekas Apartments

1444,"Absolutely loved this hotel. Though it was definitely a budget option in expensive Santorini it never felt like one. The service was exceptional, especially Chryssa in reception. The view from our room was spectacular and we just loved the pool. Most of the time it seemed like our own private pool since our terrace sat directly over it. We went into Oia for sunset one night but preferred the private sunset view from our terrace every other night. Imerovigli is a great base for exploring all of Santorini though I'd definitely recommend renting a quad bike to get out and explore the island on your own schedule versus taking the local buses (even though the buses are a fine option for getting around). We were there on our honeymoon and we will definitely be back.","June 20, 2015","28    Prekas Apartments

1447,"We booked Villa Maria Rooms & Apartments in November thinking that Santorini must be the place where we will spend our honeymoon. Much before the wedding we were already thinking about this trip as being a perfect source of relaxation, silence and rest. After we got married in the end of June, it came to the time to meet our expectation. I will never forget the times when we were traveling in Santorini with our rented car and my husband was continually repeating: Villa Maria was the perfect choice. Akrotiri is definitely the best option where to stay as we needed silence and time for ourselves. Located in the right place, Villa Maria amazed us with an incredible kind host, rich breakfast, breathtaking view, clean room and a swimming pool that you see only in movies.In general, the photos from the website do not show the reality as they are taken only to sell. But it was our first time when Villa Maria showed us the contrary! All the photos we were delighted with in the website much before to arrive there, are exactly as the reality!!!!!!!! I will always be in loved with Santorini! And not because I have spent my honeymoon there. But because Villa Maria, made my honeymoon memorable.

Never a problem to help out with taxis, car hire or any other questions.Rooms are a reasonable size, fairly basic with a very comfortable bed. Other space space to use like the pool and breakfast room with its outdoor area make up for any lack of space in the room.A few restaurants and shop are 15 minutes' walk away making it a great place to stay.","August 9, 2018","29    Villa Maria Rooms & Apartments

1449,"The view from our room was undeniably amazing, however we felt as though the hotel was trading off the view and trying to run things on the cheap. Think the lidl loo roll and naff breakfast gave me that impression. The hotel most definitely needs some TLC. Above the bed, there was a space with loose electrical wires hanging and I can only presume that a strip light should have been there and not been replaced with a new light.Also the balcony was shabby and hadn't been painted for a long time and is rather different from the pics on the website. The breakfast was mediocre at best, cheap muesli with cornflakes added and hardly any fruit in it. Also leftover foods were put out from the day before if not eaten. For instance there some sort of lattice flan that was put out and a day later it was put out again and cut into smaller pieces to eke it out, rather disappointing and a bit on the stale side. We paid around £120 per night not the most expensive on the island but still not to be sniffed at and for this price I would expect a higher standard.","November 4, 2017","29    Villa Maria Rooms & Apartments

The girls who run the place are fantastic, very attentive, polite and helpful and they assisted us on many occasions. Must say the mattresses were very average and far too firm, but otherwise the rooms were lovely. Whilst Akrotiri is a while away from Fira and Oia, this is reflected in the price per night and in my view the apartments were very good value for money. The girls will happily arrange any transport you need, including paid transfers to and from the port/airport and/or explain the various bus routes to you.

1462,"We had heard that Santorini was busy, but we were still surprised to find the main towns of Fira and Oia as crowded as they were in early June. This made our stay at Villa Maria a welcome respite from the congestion of the other towns on the Caldera edge. The hotel is located the Caldera, but is south of the main towns and therefore quieter with much less busy roads. The view is indescribably beautiful; long-range sea views from the patio of the room and even longer range from the pool. The room is absolutely beautiful and spotlessly clean and pristine white with comfortable beds.The breakfast is generous and substantial and the young woman presiding over it is unfailingly friendly, smiley (and patient with our feeble attempts at Greek.) Maria was immensely helpful, friendly and welcoming beginning with our booking and continuing throughout our stay.

The room we had was bliss and we had plenty of space! So clean, neat and authentically Greek in style with a stunning view. The beds were made daily and it was lovely to come home to at the end of every day.The complex is secluded, quiet and safe and we'd rented a car so we found it very easy with the map the girls had given us, to find our way about the island. Despite the popular belief that Oia has the best sunset views on Santorini, we made sure we saw it from somewhere different every night of our holiday and by far the best was from the Akrotiri lighthouse at the very tip of the island. It's a really short drive away from the hotel and not to be missed. The hotel makes a great base to come back to for an active family or couple, or equally the pool with sun loungers and umbrellas is amazing if you want to stay close by! The views are incredible!! The pool took our breath away a bit with cold but we found that was common on the island and it's really refreshing after laying in the sun.We would definitely stay here again on a future visit to Santorini, note : the breakfast is sooo tasty and you couldn't ask for a better view to eat in front of! On check-out we had to leave very quickly and hadn't pre-warned the girls that we'd be missing the food. They bent over backwards to send us away with what we'd have missed and it was just a perfect example of how thoughtful and kind they are as hotel owners. See photos.","June 4, 2016","29    Villa Maria Rooms & Apartments

1465,"My parents and I have just returned from a week's stay at Villa Maria and we were very sad to leave! Beautiful views, pleasantly quiet location, and run by a sweet family that made us feel right at home. Our room was well equipped, with plenty of space for the three of us. The location was perfect and just what we needed for our little getaway.Upon arrival, we were given information and recommendations on where to eat/what to do during our stay. One of my worries was my vegan diet, but I was happily provided with soya milk and plenty of options.If you want a quiet, stress-free holiday then this is the place for you; I seriously cannot fault it. The girls go above and beyond to ensure you have an enjoyable stay, and that is definitely what my family and I had!","May 26, 2016","29    Villa Maria Rooms & Apartments

1467,"We stayed in the junior suite, which offers a wonderful caldera view. The room is rather small, but lovely decorated and very cozy. Villa Maria is a very quiet and truly relaxing place. The pool is also great with an incredible view. We had a rental car to explore the island and go to dinner. Breakfast is delicious and includes homemade pies (spanakopita and bougatsa me crema - the best we have ever had in Greece). The hosts and staff are very friendly and helpful. We particularly loved about this place that it was well designed and cozy but still felt authentically Greek. We would not stay anywhere else on Santorini!

The hospitality was over the top A family owned business where we were welcomed after midnight after a long ferry ride by Maria, a tall bottle of water and a bottle of wonderful Santorini wine. The linens are pure white with Agean Blue accents. The breakfast is wonderfully simple and hit the spot. Take a trip down the trail to the private beach. It's worth the trip.

1471,"We felt the special attitude of Villa Maria owners and hosts for the first time right after booking a room there. Very helpful e-mail containing some information on the hotel, how to get there and the island overall was received within an hour or so after booking was made. All the questions asked further on were addressed promptly. Villa Maria is situated away from hustle and bustle of Thira and Oia not far from little town of Akrotiri in a place of truly amazing beauty right on caldera's brim. Bright white houses with deep blue shutters and doors naturally complements the landscape. Hotel's territory is not very big, but tenderly decorated and consists of a main house with reception, lobby and five small rooms, a number of villas, pool area and a parking.Pool is not big and two persons can hardly swim there simultaneously, but if people want just to relax in water it would be suitable for 4 or 5 persons. The water at the pool in the end of June was a bit cold, otherwise the place is excellent: located above the rest of the territory deck with amazing view. There are several umbrellas and sun loungers around it and we have never seen that all of them are occupied altogether. Reception area is also a very nice serene place where daily's breakfast (rather basic, but products of good quality) is also served. Guests may enjoy a book (there is a small book shelf with travel guides and some English literature there), ask for some water, tea or coffee when the lobby is opened (until 2 p.m. and after 5 p.m.) or relax at the hammock.The room we booked had no kitchen and was really small and all-white, but very, I would say enormously cozy! There is an A/C inside, but we never switched it on, since it was always comfortably cool there. Take into mind that there is no working desk at the room, the only table is located outside on a small terrace with two chairs and ashtray. The terraces of small rooms are not isolated from the rest territory. Bed is very good and bathroom with shower absolutely clean. The hotel provides guests with bath and pool towels that are changed every three days.Finally, a couple of words about Dionisia, a hotel owner and manager, who makes this magic come true. Upon arrival our room was not ready yet and we haven't got a rented car yet, and Dionisia took us to Akrotiri to have a lunch by her own car. She helped us with arranging wine tours and scuba-diving sessions, with printing out boarding passes and recommendations on best restaurants around. Nothing was a problem to her and we'd like to sincerely thank Dionisia once again for the wonderful stay at the island.Btw, try complement wine that will wait for you at the room, I bet you'd love it!","July 7, 2015","29    Villa Maria Rooms & Apartments

1472,"I fell in love with Villa Maria as soon as I saw it. It's simple, unpretentious and run by a family who don't try to be too chic or clever, and offer Greece as it used to be. Whitewashed, clean and spacious rooms, fantastic views of the sea and caldera, masses of flowers everywhere and a gorgeous pool overlooking it all. Oh, and fabulous breakfasts with warm home-cooked sweet and savoury pastries. Incidentally, I see that we had the family room that earned this place its only poor rating - and it was peaceful and idyllic! He must have been crazy, so please don't take any notice of his review. There really is nothing to dislike about it and in fact it offered a lot of privacy. And a special thank you to Dionisia who was so kind and helpful from the moment I booked via their website and had a bottle of Santorini wine waiting for us when we arrived on my husband's birthday. Thank you!Villa Maria is the sort of place where stresses melt away. Just lovely.","June 10, 2015","29    Villa Maria Rooms & Apartments

1473,"My friend and I spent 3 nights at Villa Maria rooms and Apartments in September 2014. This hotel is charming with a breathtaking view of the Caldera, a pretty garden and a cute little church. The rooms are quaint, comfortable and very clean. The owner is the sweetest person you can find, she could not do enough to please us. The hotel is located in Akrotiri, better to rent a car or a quad to go around Santorini Island. We were sad to leave this beautiful place.Montreal, Québec, Canada","September 29, 2014","29    Villa Maria Rooms & Apartments

1474,"Spent one week at Villa Maria on Santorini Island and loved every minute of it. Maria the owner was the perfect manager, attentive, helpful and knowledgeable of the local area including where to eat, beaches and local beauty spots. We stayed in the junior Suite with Caldera View. It was amazing, rivaling any hotel room in upmarket Oia. The room was immaculate, typical Cyclades Island style in the colours of blue and white with the most beautiful large private balcony for relaxing, watching the cruise ships come and go and having your own little private party under the stars! There's also a great pool with spectacular views for those lazy days as well. We thoroughly recommend this place and will definitely return if we come back to Santorini!

1475,"Where do I start! I stayed here for 10 days in July with my boyfriend, it was our first holiday together so we wanted it to be special. I got a bit worried after reading scary reviews about other places to stay on santorini that when you arrived, they had no record of your booking and you ended up staying at the grotty sister hotel! However, this was not the case with villa maria. It was really easy to find after we hired a car at the airport and drove around the island for a bit. The hotel is situated on a cliff and after driving down a windy drive we found it! It was the most beautiful place I've ever seen and I've done my fair bit of travelling. The reception is bright and clean and I loved the stark white and blue colour scheme. Maria (the owner) recommended a few local places to eat after we had settled in. The room was beautiful and spotless, don't think the pictures that you see on the website are too good to be true... It's even better in real life!! You will need to hire a car or a quad bike to get around the island but it's easy enough to navigate around and Oia (the most picturesque part of the island) is only about 30 minutes away and you can hire a quad from a local shop about 5 minutes walk into Akrotiri. This is a beautiful place to stay and is a really quiet area to come back to after a day at the beach or being a tourist! Don't hesitate to book... You won't be disappointed!","September 18, 2014","29    Villa Maria Rooms & Apartments

1476,"Quite honestly Villa Maria surprised us enormously. The nightly rates are very reasonable and the entire place is immaculate. The service from Dionisia is 10/10 and there is a very warm sense of 'feeling at home' as soon as you arrive. For a base to explore the South of the island, Villa Maria is perfect. Renting a car/ATV is advisable and you can be sure to look forward to returning after your night out. The pool area is really special with awesome views. The showers are hot and luxurious. The beds extremely comfortable. The balcony just right. We will certainly be recommending the Villas to everyone and with the addition of breakfast/food as of next year, this place will become even more special. Thank you so much for your hospitality, it was a truly memorable 3 nights.","September 14, 2014","29    Villa Maria Rooms & Apartments

1477,"... Stunning ! Junior suite (room 1) had the most amazing view. Rooms were very modern , had a lovely bathroom and a fantastic balcony Very minimal rooms with one slight negative - no storage only 1 hanging rail... No drawers or cupboard space so unfortunately you will have to live out of a suitcase ! Swimming pool was a lovely size for the caldera.. Dionisia - the granddaughter who managed the hotel , fantastic lady and very helpful. The rooms were kept spotlessly clean. Would definitely return.

1478,"I recently stayed at the wonderful Villa Maria whilst holidaying through the Greek Islands.As a travel agent I can comfortably say that this is one of the best properties that I have stayed at. The hospitality of the staff at this boutique resort is unbeatable, during one night where me and my fellow guests decided to stay the wonderful host Dionisia offered up a bottle of her own wine, the following night she even joined us for some Greek wine. Experiences and hospitality like this can't be bought.Just some general infromation for prospective guests this property is located on the south of the island further away from the main town however upon check in just ask Dionisia to assist you with car hire (it will be brought to the hotel for you all at a reasonable price)The pool has stunning Caldera views and I assure you won't be disappointed staying here.","July 4, 2014","29    Villa Maria Rooms & Apartments

Everything was crisp, fresh white and cleaned everyday. Hot plate, fridge and sink in kitchen area, table and chairs in the kitchen and on the balcony. We travelled with our 13yr old and the room had plenty of room for the twin beds for her too. Dionisia and her team made us so welcome. The pool view is wonderful too. Lovely walk into the village of Akrotiri. We walked to the archaelogical site and down to Caldera beach too. Great taverna Remezzo here. Take a torch for night returns!
