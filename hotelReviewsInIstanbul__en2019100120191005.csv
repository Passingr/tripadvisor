1,"As everyone seems to agree, this is a wonderful small hotel, and the staff go out of their way to be helpful and welcoming.The location is perfect, within minutes of all the major sites in Sultanahment, and within a short walk of many of the best restaurants in Istanbul.The rooms are over-the-top romantic; it's a long way from Northern European minimalism here.The breakfast buffet is very good, as is the turkish coffee and turkish delight that is offered at the end. The best thing about the top floor breakfast room, however, is the view that is dominated by the nearby Hagia Sophia. When we were there in March, we saw it almost silhouetted by the sunrise.","July 10, 2019","0    White House Hotel Istanbul

2,"Even the glowing reviews I had read did not prepare us for how wonderful the White House hotel is! The location, facility, staff and pampering are all perfection. Rose petals on the bed, spotless gilded decor, roof top breakfast, uniformed friendly helpful staff. Attention to every detail. After noticing that my husband was dragging after a full day of touring, they even sent a complimentary small bottle of wine to our room! If only I could drag this hotel around the world with me! Thank you White House!","July 10, 2019","0    White House Hotel Istanbul

The best features of the hotel are its quiet central location, impeccable service of its friendly staff and perfect rooftop (which is open throughout the day) where breakfast is served with panoramic views of Hagia Sofia and the city. The breakfast hostess Busra is particularly friendly.","July 9, 2019","0    White House Hotel Istanbul

5,"Location location location. If this is your first visit to Istanbul, the White House has the magical location with a few minutes walk to all the important sights of Sultanahmet.From your first communication with the hotel to the welcome you receive on your arrival and throughout your stay, Mr Harun (the owner) and his wonderful team will overwhelm you with kindness and hospitality. A special thanks to Mariam at the front desk.The White House is a lovely boutique hotel with 21 comfortable rooms with good bedding. It offers various rooms which accommodate families. Air conditioning works well. Wifi is pretty slow and does not retain the connection which requires signing in each time.Breakfast is a special time on the rooftop with spectacular views over Hagia Sophia. The breakfast buffet is delicious and ample.","July 7, 2019","0    White House Hotel Istanbul

6,"I stayed here for 5 nights in Istanbul and was very impressed with how clean the hotel is. All the staff i met was extremely friendly, and very accommodating. They welcome you to their hotel and treat you with utmost respect. It starts as soon as you walk in and they greet you kindly and offer you a welcome drink. Breakfast is included and was excellent quality. There's a nice rooftop restaurants that is very private and has an excellent view of the Hagia Sofia mosque. The location of this hotel is excellent and within walking distance to fine restaurants, museums, and mosques, and even bus stops to airports. I would definitely come back again or recommend it to my friends and family.","July 7, 2019","0    White House Hotel Istanbul

12,"We stayed here for 2 nights during my first visit to Istanbul. We used Safe Airport Transfer from Istanbul airport which took about 1 hour to the hotel. Check in was a breeze at which point we were served a refreshing beverage and introduced to the reception staff and given a brief orientation. There was a superior room available and was shown both rooms. We picked the larger back facing room on the fourth floor overlooking rooftops. The standard room overlooked the street. The room had near blackout windows, a minibar, tea kettle, and basic amenities. It was very quiet and the ac worked well. Because it was a smaller hotel there was no bar or restaurant on the premises, however, the area was extremely close to cafes, and an assortment of markets. The location was a quick walking distance to the major historical sights. Breakfast was included and served on the rooftop terrace. This was an extensive spread which included hot entrees, assorted pastries, cereals, fruit, salads and Turkish tea and coffee. The presentation and detail were top notch. The staff were quick to serve and extremely hospitable. The staff was eager to provide excellent suggestions on activities and nearby restaurants. I was overwhelmed by the kindness and graciousness of every staff member. They were truly a professional team. I highly recommend this property for not only its ideal location but for its cleanliness, value, and outstanding choice of staff. ","July 1, 2019","0    White House Hotel Istanbul

13,"The only reason I decided to give this property a try was because of a VERY large number of positive reviews the property had, and I AM SOOOO GLAD I BOOKED IT.Truly unbelievable and OUTSTANDING customer service one can ever experience in a hotel. Right from the time I booked the hotel, to the time I landed up there actually, the follow up by the owner was also par excellence. I really don’t know how EVERY SINGLE STAFF MEMBER literally treats you like a family member. They are quick to respond to any request, suggestions, etc. and want to make you as comfortable in not only the hotel but in the knowledge of the surrounding area as well. The location has many other hotels at an arms length away, but I can say WITHOUT ANY DOUBT WHATSOEVER THAT THIS IS TRULY THE BEST PROPERTY ONE CAN STAY IN WITH REGARDS TOPMOST CUSTOMER SERVICE. I SALUTE THE OWNER TO HAVE TRAINED HIS STAFF SO WELL.The room was SUPER CLEAN and SO WAS THE TOILET. The decor is very ornate and gave traditionally beautiful look.The proximity to top sites like Blue Mosque, Aya Sofia, etc is an added bonus. There were many nice restaurants in the vicinity too that served amazing food at 1 a.m. I took a walk around 1 a.m. and IT WAS ABSOLUTELY SAFE. My only one regret is that I wish I could have stayed here for longer.","June 28, 2019","0    White House Hotel Istanbul

21,"I have visited 20 countries and this is a hotel that has pleased me beyond measure, more than most hotels I've been to. Yes, the rooms are small but they are pretty, spotlessly clean and comfortable. The hotel's location is exceptional and their breakfast delightful. But the best thing about it is its staff. I traveled alone to Istanbul and it was honestly thanks to this hotels' manager and staff that I never felt alone or lost. I sent Mr. Haroun many emails before coming and he never complained and in fact replied promptly giving me all the information I wanted beforehand, most of it not even related to the hotel. At the front desk, Kemal and Meryam gave me advice about things I could do and places I could visit that was better than any guide because it was honest and with no charge. And I will never forget the warm smiles and lovely conversations I had with Bushra, the guest relations manager, which made me feel that I always had company. In short, this is not just an excellent, clean and comfortable hotel. It is a place where I found help, company and excellent advice and service. Thank you all Mr. Haroun, Meryam, Bushra and Kemal for making my trip to Istanbul an exceptional and unforgettable one.","June 15, 2019","0    White House Hotel Istanbul

We did not have any problem with noise as some reviews stated even though we were on the first floor (104). Seagulls chatted throughout the evenings but we enjoyed that! Hagia Sophia, Blue Mosque, Basilica Cistern, markets, ferries, restaurants all within easy walking distance so it was a great location for our first visit. Breakfast on the terrace was a highlight each day, especially the turkish coffee. We also spent a couple of evenings there just enjoying the view. Altogether a great trip.

Its location in Sultanahmet made it possible to walk to Blue Mosque, Hagia Sophia, Topkapi Palace as well as the best restaurants. My most important criteria, the cleanliness was met with great satisfaction. I don't think I have enough space to say the wonderful things about the staff.

37,"After deciding on a real last minute city break to Istanbul, I started to investigate flights and hotels etc. I happened upon a great deal through Expedia and one of the hotels was The White House hotel. The photos looked interesting and the reviews were excellent, and it was a superb deal, so I booked.The hotel is very well placed indeed within easy walking distance of many of the major sites. The welcome was amazing, a personal briefing of everything, a glass of chilled orange and some Turkish Delight, and a little gem pinned onto us ""to protect you when in Istanbul"" which was a sweet touch. Our room was actually upgraded for free much to our delight! The room was lovely, clean and spacious and with lots of nice little touches. Attention for detail is apparent here.All members of staff without exception were friendly and helpful, and they wanted us to enjoy and make the most of their amazing city, and were only to willing to suggest helpful ideas.Breakfast was on the roof terrace, and was laid out in a truly beautiful artistic way. The food was very varied and deliciuos, especially the honeycomb. It was wonderful to be able to relax over a lovely breakfast and enjoy views over the city and its minarets.Checkout was efficient and easy, and there was even a farewell gift of a box of Turkish Delight.

Service was absolutely amazing from every single hotel team member we encountered.*Location was perfect- walking distance to all major visit spots.*We were greeted with a Turkish delicacy and a glass of juice upon our arrival also gifted us a little souvenir clip with their protective eye and gave us cute little departing gifts as well *Arrived very early in the morning but they accommodated us earlier due to having the availability to do so.*Complimentary breakfast was absolutely delicious with different varieties on both days we stayed.*We walked into our rooms when we first arrived to find the beds decorated with rose pedals and a letter welcoming us from the owner who ensured that their top priority would be for us to have the best possible stay with them * wonderful recommendations from all staff members on where to go, which time was best etc.*Safe neighborhood with no worriesOverall an absolute pleasure to stay at this gem && recommended to anyone traveling to Istanbul ","May 17, 2019","0    White House Hotel Istanbul

42,"From the moment we walked in the friendly staff couldn't do enough for us. From the welcome drink and sweet treat to the help with luggage, dining option and info re airport transport. Our room was not overly large but did have a small balcony. Ornately furnished but didn't feel over the top; lots of white so spacious feeling. Excellent shower, toiletries, and even a box of tissues (not normal elsewhere). Wonderful breakfast room on the roof terrace level, again attentive service and great selection of food. Tea/coffee avail in room and also breakfast room all day. Only downside was no luggage rack in the bedroom. Easy access to tram line, airport bus and lots of local restaurants.","May 16, 2019","0    White House Hotel Istanbul

43,"Amazing place, perfect location (5 minute walk from Blue Mosque, Hagia Sofia, and great restaurants and shops, and the tram line), and friendly attentive staff who were immensely accommodating and helpful with guidance for navigating the city. Elegant room with all the necessities. (I had booked a twin room, but was generously upgraded to a full room when I checked in, at no extra charge.) The rooftop for breakfast and coffee is hard to believe. The top ratings are more than justified--I'd give them 6 stars if I could. All this to say you can stop looking now and make your reservation.","May 15, 2019","0    White House Hotel Istanbul

45,"My boyfriend and I stood at the White House for 4 nights and from the moment we arrived, it was great. The owner/Manager Harun was super friendly and greeted us with drink and pastry. The hotel smells amazing with their floral scent and is very clean. There was a bigger room available and we were upgraded free of charge. The White House Hotel is in the center of everything and can get to anywhere by walking. Breakfast was okay (a little on the light side) so don’t expect a heavy breakfast however you will be full with their options. One big plus is that food is served upstairs (rooftop) with an AMAZING VIEW of the Hagia Sophia. (Please visit at night, breathtaking) Again, you will never be disappointed with staying at this hotel. If I come again to Istanbul, this is the place where I would come. best regards, Henry Carrero and Zaskya Weeks","May 14, 2019","0    White House Hotel Istanbul

48,"This is a lovely boutique hotel with an extremely personal and friendly feel.The manager welcomes all guests with some Turkish delight and a drink whilst he explains the hotel and answers and questions. All the staff were incredibly helpful, polite and professional whilst still being friendly and personal.Breakfast had a great selection and was on the rooftop with a lovely view of the blue mosque.The rooms were all decorated beautifully (lots of white and gold) and spotless. There were lots of little touches such as rose petals on the bed and a hand written welcome letter and a gift at check out.The hotel itself is located so close to the blue mosque/ Hagia Sofia (literally a 2 minute walk) and also very close to lots of restaurants and the metro M1 line. So it is perfect if you do not have much time in Istanbul.We needed to get to the airport during rush hour, the hotel called us a taxi, but after they were all stuck in traffic, then they tried to help us get an uber (again all stuck in traffic, there was an accident). We were worried about missing the flight so they suggested a bus which leaves from the blue mosque plaza and run every half an hour. They took us to the plaza, helped us to buy the bus ticket and checked we would make it to the airport in time. They then came back 10 minutes later and made sure we got onto the bus without any problems. This was so much more than we'd expect a hotel worker to do, and was so kind and reassured us so much. We cannot praise the staff and owner enough!We have stayed at a lot of different hotels in different countries but this one really stands out, definitely recommend to anyone in Istanbul!","May 11, 2019","0    White House Hotel Istanbul

52,"We purposely chose a small, boutique, Turkish hotel for the experience and were very pleasantly surprised. First we were greeted by the owner, Harun, with Turkish refreshments and a brief orientation to hotel and area (with a map that was very helpful). What we loved about the hotel - very clean, great housekeeping, wonderful breakfast with views, caring and helpful staff (especially Maryam at front desk), felt very safe, and central location within walking distance to ALL the sites in Old City and Bosporus Cruise. The room we had for 6 nights was small, (standard double) that we booked on Expedia. We chose not to ask for another room since we spent very little time there but are sure they would have accommodated us had we asked. They did bring extra hangers and luggage racks and it worked out very well. When we left Maryam also gave us some Turkish Delight to enjoy on our trip home. We would definitely come again!","April 29, 2019","0    White House Hotel Istanbul

65,"We had this hotel selected for us due to an appointment locally. We stayed for five nights and were overall very happy with the hotel and would stay again if in the area.The airport near by will soon be closed so it will be perfect currently just a few cargo planes leaving.The reception desk is very friendly and efficient but is way over when you walk in so first you walk by the security which i understand why you have but is not friendly and first impressions when you arrive is not good, even after a few days they still just look through you its a little odd for a five star hotel.The rooms are very nice and well appointed with everything a business person would need but if you are on a leisure break they have a no comfortable seating in the room or else where in the hotel( all very modern but no comfort) The gym and other areas are all very nice and good set up, the first day we enjoyed using everything but the guy on the desk was so unfriendly ( i don't think he knows he is in hospitality ) The indoor and outdoor pools are both lovely. Lots of sunbeds too.Breakfast was brilliant and more choice than you could possibly need and the staff were great and nothing was a problem.Dinner on the roof restaurant was very nice a little cool at night right now.The food was really good both nights and highly recommend eating in as its a great menu.The drink service from the bar to the restaurant is some what slow and is a little frustrating when you would like your drink while you still have your food.You can access the water front from a gate by the pool and walk/jog along the front to a great shopping mall and other eating places.The only thing this hotel seems to miss is a nice area in the day to have coffee or a light snack, i guess when the weather is warm the outside terrace is nice but currently it does not seem set up for people to light lunch/ coffee etc (April)","May 3, 2019","1    Crowne Plaza Istanbul - Florya

71,"I thought this would be a good hotel to spend an overnight and a day in Istanbul on my way from Singapore to the UK. Bad idea. Long way from the International airport but directly on the flight path for the domestic airport. Planes were landing every 30 seconds or so and all day long, screaming overhead and rendering double glazing useless. Supposed to be white noise in the rooms but ended up leaving the TV on to try and minimise the noise. To trump that, I had staff including two maintenance men enter my room 4 times during the day without my permission and while I was in bed having a sleep. Despite all that, the hotel was new, modern decor and pleasant room with all necessities available. I only had one meal at breakfast time and it was varied and plentiful. Check in staff were pleasant and helpful and the manager was most apologetic when I pointed out my complaints.","March 20, 2019","1    Crowne Plaza Istanbul - Florya

74,Choose this hotel as it’s close to the airport and advertises with a free shuttle. Good luck finding the shuttle at door 8. As the doors have no numbers. I gave up after one hour and took a cab.

I’d simply chosen the property for its closeness to Ataturk Airport, but finally found out that it’s incomparably better than most hotels in Istanbul in terms of location and front desk support.Although the housekeeping and cleanliness are not what you normally expect a 5 star hotel to be, the overall stay is comfortable and convenient.At first, I was a bit concerned about whether or not the close air traffic would bother, but ended up loving it. Another unique thing is fabulous walking path along the seaside. Europe’s biggest aquarium is just a few steps away as well as a decent shopping mall next to it, aptly named ‘aqua florya’. The breakfast menu was fairly good in variety and quality.The indoor swimming pool and spa are too good to miss.By and large, I’m quite happy that I won’t have to waste time searching for other places in Istanbul on my next visits.

86,"We had a one night layover transiting from SFO to Nairobi. I will start with the good stuff about this hotel: Clean, modern, very comfortable beds and close to the Airport(although come March Atatruk Airport is closing and the new International Airport will make this location obsolete as a ""airport hotel""). It is a 5 min walk to a American style mall and after the long flight it was nice to take a walk down road and wander around for a bit to fight off some jet lag. Now for the not so good: The airport shuttle only runs once an hour(not stated anywhere on their webpage) we arrived after a long flight to stand and wait in the chaos of the airport to eventually learn by calling the hotel we had another 35 min wait and we got a cab instead. The check-in process was disorganized and slow. Our one night stay happened to fall on New Years eve and there was a couple of events going on at the hotel. A band played until 3:30AM and the thumping from the bass could be felt all the way into our room making it difficult to sleep. I was super annoyed that our bed side alarm had been pre set for 7am so it went off waking us before we intended. It is super irritating that the hotel staff does not clear the alarm from previous guests as a part of the clean up. It is stated that this is a non smoking hotel but the hallways smelled of cigarette smoke and I smelled smoke coming from the room next door both when we arrived and also the next morning. Overall mixed experience. Not all bad but I was hoping for a good night sleep as a transit stop and that was not the case at this location.","January 1, 2019","1    Crowne Plaza Istanbul - Florya

100,"We probably had the worst hotel experience we ever had at this place.The reason why we chose Crowne Plaza Florya hotel was the proximity to the airport and the shuttle service to/from the airport. My family and I needed a place to stay for one night before our international flight from the Ataturk airport. I have a 2.5 year old daughter, we had a lot of bags so I wanted to stay at a hotel that would be easy to access from the airport. I made our reservation months ago after confirming with the hotel that they have a free shuttle running frequently between their hotel and the airport. The thing about the Istanbul airport is that, if you try to get a taxi from the taxi stand, they refuse to take you to nearby places after waiting so long in the line. This is why we wanted a shuttle. This is why we wanted a hotel with shuttle service.Our bad experience started the night we arrived in Istanbul. We flew to the domestic terminal the night we checked in. I had spoken with a lady at the hotel reception multiple times about how to get to the hotel at that point. Upon arrival, she told us that we are supposed to walk to the International terminal to be picked up by the shuttle and wait until 30 past the hour. She never mentioned that there is no sidewalk/walkway between the two terminals. You have to walk for 10 minutes on the busy road with all your bags and your child where no cars respect the safety of pedestrians. The shuttle can easily make two stops, one at domestic one at international but they don't do this and expect people to walk. After we finally arrived at the international and found the ""Door B"" (there are two of them by the way), it was basically not a place for a 2.5 year old to be so by luck we got a taxi that just dropped somebody off and got to the hotel.After check-in, I let them now about my frustration about the pickup situation but didn't make a big deal out of it. We had our names put on the reservation sheet to be taken to the airport by the same shuttle at 12pm the next day. We were going to the international terminal this time anyway so it didn't matter. The real story began the following day. About 25 minutes before noon, I called the reception requesting somebody to come and help with our bags and told them that we were going to get the 12pm shuttle. 5 minutes later, somebody came to check the minibar, to see if we consumed anything before we checked out, however 15 minutes after I called the reception, still nobody had come for the bags so I called again. At that time, my wife and daughter headed to the lobby to make sure we catch the shuttle. I took all the bags out of the room waiting, but 10 minutes later still nobody had come. It was past 12pm at this point so I had to leave the bags unoccupied and went to the lobby as well. When I arrived at the lobby, I found my wife arguing with hotel staff about the shuttle. Shuttle apparently got filled with people and had gone already. Hotel staff was so rude to my wife blaming her that we supposedly didn't have a reservation then later saying they see the reservation now. Instead of apologizing for making us wait in the room for the bags to be picked up and missing the shuttle, they were saying things like these sort of things could happen in big/busy 5 star hotels, that we were supposed to call earlier etc. The supposed ""Guest relations manager"" lady was lecturing us about how big 5 star hotels work, how airport shuttle services work as if any of this was new for us. I've stayed in hundreds of hotels, traveled through many countries and cities and never experienced anything like this. All airport shuttles stop to pickup and drop off passengers from all terminals everywhere. I saw other transfer shuttles at the domestic terminal picking up people also. In all 5 star hotels, if you are checking out and if you request help for your bags, within a couple minutes somebody shows up. They don't keep you waiting for half an hour despite multiple phone calls and then blame you instead. Also, reminder that they were so eager to send someone to check the minibar!That ""Guest Relations Manager"" lady has no place in managing anything in my personal opinion. None of the members of the staff had name tags so I don't know who she was, but she was one of the so called managers that were arguing with us when we were trying to get out.At the end, they arranged a taxi for us, I had to put my daughter on my lap with bags on the seats next to me in dangerous Istanbul traffic. The whole point in booking this hotel was so that we could avoid a taxi.","September 22, 2018","1    Crowne Plaza Istanbul - Florya

102,"First of all, let me emphasize that the hotel is absolutely beautiful and you can notice it is brand new and clean. However, we had an almost terrible experience there due to the following events:1. Nobody speaks any other language but Turkish or extremely bad English. My other five languages that I speak didn't come in handy either. In a hotel where the majority of the guests are tourists or business travelers come from abroad, it is absolutely unacceptable that the reception and customer service personnel doesn't speak English at a fluent level.2. Room windows are equipped with big and dense curtains which is a good solution due to the fact that you can see airplanes flying into Atatürk Airport from your own window. We were laying in bed while the curtain rail detached itself from the ceiling and banged on the floor dragging the curtains with it. We immediately called the reception trying to explain the issue but lo and behold none of the three employees didn't understand what we were desperately trying to explain. Finally, they sent the technician who explained the situation and their answer was that either we change rooms and by doing so get a double-bed room, although we had booked and paid for a room with a king-size bed, or wait until tomorrow so the rail could get repaired. We even wanted to pay more to get our stay upgraded but they insisted on giving us a double-bed room only. Upon our question, whether they could upgrade our offer so we stay in the room type we had previously booked, they didn't even want to listen to us but kept repeating the same with no explanation whatsoever.3. I absolutely adore cats and have an old lady on my own back home but the amount of wild cats on the restaurant terrace makes the hotel where you pay around €105 per night look like a flea market. Nonetheless, I gave some ham to the poor kittens.The cherry on top, however, was when cats started meowing, hissing and fighting around our feet while we were having dinner in the ""classy"" restaurant on the rooftop of the hotel. We couldn't even have a nice dinner in peace that we paid almost 200 Lira for which is a pretty penny in Turkey.4. While checking out, the receptionist handed us over our bill that looked suspicious once we saw the final amount. The reason for that was that they charged us for our stay even though we had already paid for it online a couple of months ago. Again, we had to use our hands and legs to explain the situation and prove that we were telling the truth. Finally, after a debate that lasted almost a half an hour, they admitted that the amount we had in advance paid wasn't visible in the system at first sight. The point is that if we hadn't checked the bill, we would've been charged twice.There are some good sides though:1. The pool is nice and clean.2. The food is absolutely amazing.","September 16, 2018","1    Crowne Plaza Istanbul - Florya

119,"This is our fourth visit to Sea Mansions, this time to celebrate my special birthday. The staff made us so welcome and brought gave me a beautiful cake. Sea Mansion is a small, clean, cosy hotel in a wonderful location of the old city in Istanbul. Ten minutes walk from the Blue Mosque, the tram and , Arasta Bazaar. Many of the rooms have wonderful views of the sea and soon the new top floor rooms will have balconies with amazing views. It has a small dining room and bar looking over the Bosphorus. The rooms are clean and the beds are extremely comfortable. The staff are really friendly and nothing is too much trouble. The only thing that only slightly let’s the hotel down is the breakfast, but if you ask for something specific such as omelette, toast or fresh fruit, the staff will get it for you, without any hesitation. In the next couple of weeks their new building will be ready, with family suites and big walk in showers. We can’t wait to go back. Thank you to Murat and all the staff for making my birthday celebrations so special. ","December 8, 2018","2    GLK PREMIER Sea Mansion Suites & Spa

124,"The hotel is located in Sultanahmet which is a nice quiet and calm area within walking distance to the Blue Mosque, Hagia Sophia, hippodromes and Sultanahmet team station (so it's easy to get everywhere you need to). We got a sea view room with a king size bed. A bit smaller than expected but overall a nice room. The hotel staff were all amazing! Super friendly and really went out of their way to make us comfortable. Especially Çiğdem who we got to know personally and gave us really good advice to make our trip safer and more enjoyable. All of the staff took their time explaining what we should go visit and when. They offer cruises and day trips hosted by a separate company that you can book through the hotel - I recommend doing it this way as they'll pick you up and drop you off at the hotel. We did the bosphorous and the Princes Islands cruises and highly recommend them. The bosphorus cruise is a bit more jam packed and tiring whereas the Princes Island one is more chill. They have nice sauna/ hammam facilities that you can book out to use privately as well as book massages. Breakfast is buffet style with the option to request certain things like omlettes and pancakes (which we requested, a lot!). They have indoor and outdoor seating but why bother sitting indoors when you eat facing the sea?? They also have a gorgeous resident cat called Nazlr ❤️ Overall we had a great time in Istanbul thanks to this hotel and all the staff!

In fact, the staff at the hotel make it so much better. The facilities at the hotel are great.

131,Very charming welcome. They even helped to park my car. The whole stay the day receptionist have been very helpful. We picked this hotel for 7 nights mainly for the view and SPA even if it was quite expensive. Well view from first floor room we had been given was somewhere obstructed. The Sauna Hammam massage and gym are all in the same room . So if there is someone in one these activities you cannot access. I find it a problem that should be underlined. At 7h00 staff was taking breakfast with us and smoking on terrace. No problem really but not what you expect at this price. Not mentioning that in the room when the window was opened we sometimes had this cigarette smell coming from the terrace.If weather is bad I you have to take breakfast in the lobby which is very small. Or go on the terrace a bit sheltered to face the elements.On the whole a good stay but...in my opinion too expensive for what is proposed. ,"May 24, 2018","2    GLK PREMIER Sea Mansion Suites & Spa

We had paid for and asked for family rooms but some of the rooms were not family rooms, they had one double bed and sofa converted to single beds for the children (not ideal!). I did not like one of the managements treatments for my request for some warm milk for my little girl. I said I would pay for it but he insisted that I go to the local shop and buy it, this was past midnight. When you’re on holiday, you don’t really want to go to the shops in the middle of the night! Also he mentioned that they don’t have enough milk for the morning breakfast, which is completely untrue for a hotel not to have a glass of milk.

We arrived really late into Istanbul due to a delayed flight and our airport pick up was still waiting for us. He drove us right to the hotel where we were greeted by the manager and his assistant. We were offered tea and or coffee and able to order some pizza to our room because all the restaurants were closed. Quickly we went to a little grocery down the street picked up some refreshments then headed back. The hotel was in a such a nice location, we were a ten minute walk into the most museums and sights.

Sebel made good suggestions about places to eat and efficiently made our travel arrangements. Saleh made us feel at home when we returned to hotel in the evening and looked after our requirements very well. It is small boutique hotel, the important thing is that they have sparkling clean bathrooms and nice, comfortable bed with clean linen.

They offered us waters as the gentleman from the front desk sat us down and explained the hotel amenities and what to do in Istanbul in general.The hotel itself was beautiful. We both had an amazing bath, the bed was incredible and so luxurious and the housecleaning staff were lovely. The man on reception recommended a place for dinner (which was close and affordable), which took us through a local market and the blue mosque, that was only five minutes away. It was delicious and the local markets were less aggressive than the grand bazaar (which is also only a short walk away).The breakfast was included and was ample and I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough!

155,"I am not the type of person to ever leave a review, but I recently came back from a two-week long trip in Istanbul and I have not been able to shake the sheer hospitality and welcoming environment of this hotel and staff. I was a little hesitant when we arrived, simply from seeing how small and dainty the place was, but was easily able to adjust, and for good reason. First off, the location is absolutely perfect. From being to Istanbul several times, I can tell you that this is exactly where you want to be in terms of centrality. As soon as we walked in the staff greeted us with warm smiles and offered us some refreshments. They are the most willing to help, especially when it comes to directions/advice on what to do/where to go. We truly became friends with the staff through all the wonderful mornings at breakfast where we were greeted with warmth and comfort and an amazing array of fresh food (the best spread I have ever seen at a small hotel). This hotel embodies the exact charm and charisma that Istanbul as a city represents. There are plenty of international chain hotels in Istanbul that you can stay at but none will offer what this hotel does, which is authenticity and character. You will not regret your stay here.

174,"I usually look at the general reviews by other travellers before booking. Basileus had a high rating and I have found it deserves a truly highest rating. The location is good and room is clean. It is reasonably priced given that the physical condition of the building cannot be significantly improved. What is more important is the team work of superb employees, which more than compensates the physical conditions of the facility. They are well coordinated, knowledgeable about most things guests would want, always courteous, happy to accomodate my special needs, and especially they love their job. Here is my general summary of each member:Selim: A perfect manager, excellent communication, good EnglishOmer: Ask him about all the good eats in Turkey. Very detail-oriented for day trips from Istanbul.Murat: Kind and generous. He could help if you have unusual requests.Ibrahim: He would do whatever is necessary.

They are very knowledgeable about Istanbul and will help you get the most out of your stay.Room: Decent, has all the facilities you'll need, not very luxurious but not bad either.Location: This is the hotels true gem. It's location is perfect for seeing all the sights. The only taxi you'll need is too and from the stunning new airport (max 140tl around £18 each way). You will be walking distance from blue mosque, Ayasofia, Topkapi Palace, Basilica cistern, Grand Bazaar. You can then get an Istanbul card and top it up for £5-£10 which will get you metro rides further afield to the Dolmache palace, Sulemania mosque and the port to take a ferry to the Asian Side. You will be ideally located to local Hamams £10 and Turkish shave £5. The Hamam is a basic one not that rigorous but still great value for money.Overall: Istanbul is a fantastic city and a place you'll want to revisit. We went with young kids and still had a great time as this hotel is so ideally located. The city is relatively cheap and a meal for 4 was coming to around £25-£30. The major chains like McDonald's and Starbucks are half the price of UK. I loved the fact that no one pressure sells you in the markets and bazaars which was one of my worries.

On the positive side the Hotel is well positioned and in easy walking distance to the Blue Mosque and the other sights in the old town. Selim and Omar in reception were also very helpful.Otherwise we found the amenities well below the standard suggested in the reviews. I believe the Hotel was number 1 in Trip Advisor when we made our booking.Our room was on the 3rd floor with no lift. The view from our window was the wall of the next door building a few feet away complete with bricked up windows. There was wiring showing around the room and the sink tap came apart gushing water all over the bathroom and myself the second time using it. On the landings and entrance to the Hotel reception from the staircase there was mattresses bottles and other boxes stored. Furnishings were generally dated. Breakfast was ok but certainly not special.In saying the above I realise this is an old building but still cannot equate the excellent reviews with where we stayed.

191,"we selected this hotel because of tripadvisor ratting and reviews , and because of january holiday the hotel price is over normal and about (140 $ for two night ) . that was not our first visit and actually i visited istanbul many time and normally we go there three time a year , so we i experienced many hotels from 3 star to 5 star and boutique hotels , what i write here is in comparison with other hotels Positive things : 1- First thank to the hotel reception staffs . i have to say that the 3 reception staff is very very experienced people i have ever seen in hotels , very helpful and take carrying you all the time you are in the hotel 2- Hotel Location is very good too especially for whom who loves historical attractions, it is located walking distance from sultanahmet square Negative thing : 1- The rooms is very outdated small room and need improvement for example painting , and also there was no special decorated thing in room 2- Bed quality was bad and it need improvement too 3- Although our bathroom had bathtub but it was very out dated and look dirty too i attached one picture from it here 4- the towels was torned and old 4- The mini refrigerator did not work properly and did not cold any thing 5- There wasn't any elevator in this boutique hotel and unfortunately our room was in 3th flour .6- Breakfast restaurant served in the underground and very dark and outdated area . 7- Men WC in restaurant was out of service and woman WC was not clean too 8- Breakfast was nothing special with very limited choices 9-The sharing area in this hotel except the small lobby wasn't decorated and clean and finally i think there are more better choice with the price that we paid in istanbul","January 6, 2019","3    Basileus Hotel

They will give you an itinerary to suit the duration of your stay, carry your bags, arrange for transport, arrange for shopping etc etc we didn’t have a thing to worry about! I highly recommend this hotel for all travellers as the rooms are clean, spacious, affordable and provide you with all the amenities you would need. Even in winter, our rooms were warm and fresh towels were provided everyday. There are all sorts of juices available for breakfast including ponengranate and an assortment of cheese, cold appetisers and eggs as well as bread and fruit. Location of the hotel is great, you can reach the Sultanahmet attractions in 10 minutes by foot and 20 minutes to the airport.

193,"I booked this hotel based on Booking.com rating of 9.3. In fact I had canceled the other bookings when I found out about this hotel so generally the expectations were quite high. It’s commendable that all the staff members were very helpful, friendly, courteous and would do things with simile on their faces. The other positive point was the location of the hotel. It’s absolutely a great accessible location. Blue Mosques, Hagia Sophia (Ayasofia) are just 5 to 7 minutes walk away. The walk is uphill though. It’s also just 15 minutes from Grand Bazar but again quite long uphill walk too. The room was quite good in size and was clean. It had all the basic amenities. We were there in winters, the heating worked quite well.Upon our arrival we came to know that our room was in basement which was not mentioned at the time of booking. They didn’t have any room available on top floors. In fairness they offered they offered to change room next day but we had to come in the middle of the day to change the room which was not possible.The bed was not as comfortable as it looked. It was just good enough to crash at night after long day. The washroom started to stink the 2nd day. They managed to fix it somehow but the smell wasn’t completely gone. Thankfully it was still liveable after they fixed and if the door kept close. The TV didn’t work at all but we were given some discount on our airport transfer price as compensation. The hotel in particular doesn’t have good views even if you get room on top floor. Despite the issues we had, it was still worth for the price we paid. However, other options with better views can be found in the same area.","December 6, 2018","3    Basileus Hotel

The location is walkable to all the main attraction such as Topaki Palace, Blue Mosque, Hagia Sophia and Sultanahmet Metro.

The Salim, the manager is extremely knowlegable with regard to the history of this amazing place, he will give maps and directions to various places you would have difficulty finding on your own, we visited as many of the attraction we could over our 4 day visit and had wonderful meals in many interesting places all booked by the hotel - they even provided umbrellas on the one inclement day we had! It was the first time our friend had visited and they were somewhat nervous of visiting such a big city, they are now extremely keen to go back for longer next time - so watch out Basileus the 'oldies' will return next year!","November 5, 2018","3    Basileus Hotel

The location of the hotel is fantastic, with all the historical sites, grand bazaar and tram station, within easy reach (5 minutes) by foot. The beautiful furnishings of the hotel and complimentary (bottled water, in-house tea/ coffee, sweets) is great value! The WiFi signal strength was strong. The cleanliness is perfect and the breakfast sublime with a vast choice of food and drinks. The staff and owners were all friendly and helpful. Mohamed on reception gave a warm welcome and his hospitality was very impressive. On arrival he pointed all the main tourist sites on the map, and showed me the Istanbul guides in reception. Mohamed also arranged my airport transfer, which was very helpful. The surroundings of the hotel were peaceful at night and the hotel security was very safe.

203,"I stayed 4 nights at the Basileus Hotel and it was an excellent experience. 1. Location couldn't be any better. It's literally right within 5 min walk from Blue Mosque. It's definitely located in the best area of Istanbul with so many shops and restaurants around. I couldn't feel any safer walking around the area at the day and night.2. Service was just above and beyond. Omar was extremely helpful. He gave us so many useful recommendations. I knew that at any point I could go downstairs and I would always be helped. They do care a lot about their guests. Keep up the good work!3. Excellent buffet breakfast. Every morning we had buffet breakfast, which was great. So many different options and food was great.4. Rooms itself were not so great. I mean rooms were comfortable and very clean; however, they do need some major fix ups. So as shower and furniture. It didn't really matter to us since we were coming to our room just to sleep. It's not one of those places were you come to spend time in your hotel room. It's just a base for a full day of exploring.5. Noise. Room we were staying was located right above some bar/restaurant. We noticed that they were playing music very loud well pass 2am. We didn't really care since we are just two adults who are very tired by the end of the day. But if I was staying with my toddler I wouldn't be happy. We mentioned it to Omar and he ensured us that we can complain to him if noise is bothering us. He would make a call to stop them from playing music. We never did because it didn't bother us that much.6. You cannot beat the price. For 50$ a night we paid it was a steal. If we ever come back to Istanbul we will book our stay at the Basileus hotel without even thinking about it.","October 15, 2018","3    Basileus Hotel

Omar, Mohamed, Selim and the ""boys"" (apologies for not knowing their names) were always there to assist and nothing was a trouble to them. We got a room upgrade and were very satisfied with our room. AC worked well, bed was comfortable, good shower with great water pressure (although not ideal for older folks), safe and mini-fridge in the room. TV had no English channel. Free bottled water daily. Wi-Fi worked well. Breakfast had plenty to choose from and nobody will go hungry. Location is great to visit the majority of the sights in the old city. Restaurants close by are good. Cab from the airport was 55 TL (Sunday ride, not much traffic). We took public transportation back to airport and it was very easy to manage.

206,"The staff were very helpful and friendly and it was a real pleasure to stay there. We would happily stay there again. We had two rooms booked, the first night they were on different floors so we asked if we could move one of them to have two adjacent rooms for the following nights and this was done efficiently and with no fuss. Our rooms on the 2nd floor were very comfortable (although there is no lift).In a central location like this there was inevitably some noise from the road outside and from the neighbouring cafes etc. this is probably more apparent in a room that overlooks the street and on the 1st floor but as our rooms were at the rear and on the 3rd floor we were only a little affected. Rooms on the Ground floor and Basement might be more affected by other guests.Breakfast was a cold buffet served in the Basement.The location was ideal, within walking distance of the major Sultanahmet attractions and also very accessible by taxi from the airport.

211,"We caught the train and the tram connection back to a stop where we could walk bast the Blue Mosque to the the Basileus hotel easily. On arrival I was impressed with the Hotel's stylish decore and it's boutique -type feeling. Everything was of good taste and Omar recalled my booking. The perfect-English-speaking managers include Omar, Selim and Mohammad who are so willing to advise on Istanbul's attractions and how to get there. Our rooms had good beds with quality fittings (fridge, safe). It seemed we had made a great selection for the perfect location, made even better by the unobtrusive liquor store across the lane.Basileus breakfasts were fresh and clean with good variety for different palates. I went hard on the Yoghurt and the honey. Honestly, the Basileus staff treat you like a family member. The warmth and sincerity of these three managers affords this hotel a family atmosphere and it really one of the loveliest hotels of the almost twenty we had stayed in during our Turkey trip. A good restaurant 20 metres way, non-touristic music from exotic instruments at Kumkapi, Spice Market, Grand Bazaar, the water ferries, the mosques and museums trams, trains. tour buses - all within walking distance.The Basileus was great to come home to each evening following our adventures in Istanbul.

212,"I booked the Basileus Hotel after reading the reviews on TripAdvisor and I'm so glad that I did. The booking of the room was an easy process via email with Selim and Omar. They also arranged a transfer from the airport to the hotel for us which made our life that much easier on arrival.I had emailed Selim advising him that it was my husband's birthday on the day we arrived and they arranged a lovely birthday cake and decorated our room with balloons and candles (a lovely touch).On arrival at the hotel, Selim and Omar make one feel very welcome and they both go out of their way to accommodate guest's requirements and provide advice on where to go and what to see.The hotel is very quaint and in the Sultanhamet area of Istanbul. It is located about 10 minutes uphill walk from the main sights in Old Istanbul.The rooms are a decent size for a city hotel, beds are comfortable however extra pillows are needed. The only downside of our room was that it faced a cafe bar and very often the music would be playing until the early hours.Breakfast is plentiful and is hosted in the basement room of the hotel. You can choose from the traditional Turkish breakfast and order omelettes to accompany this.A lovely touch is the complimentary bottles of water provided in the room as well as tea, coffee and cake in the lobby area. This hotel is excellent value for money and the customer service is outstanding. Many of the larger hotel chains could learn a thing or two from this family run hotel.We will definitely be coming back to Istanbul and look forward to staying at the Basileus Hotel again.Thank you Hotel Basileus for our lovely stay.","September 14, 2018","3    Basileus Hotel

213,"I was excited about staying here because of all the wonderful reviews, and pleased by the seemingly good deal on the room price, but my misgivings started soon after I walked in the front door. We were late arrivals, and had informed the hotel. They brought us up to our room, already telling us in the lobby that we could change if we didn't like it. We were so tired, we just said it was fine and just wanted to shower and to sleep, but after 10 minutes it was clear that Room 307 was not for us. It was tiny, clean, but very run down, with mold stains in the corner of the bathroom ceiling, black grout in the shower, no place in the shower to put any soap or shampoo, and a soap rack by the sink that was barely attached to the wall. The rest of the room was similarly dingy. The AC unit blew directly down on the bed, so we were either unbearably hot or freezing cold especially since the thermostat didn't work.We called down and asked to change rooms that night. The other room they showed us the next morning was not much nicer. I went back and read other negative reviews and people did seem to have a similar experience where, when they complained about the original room, they were upgraded. So maybe it is a pattern to give guests the worst room first and see if they complain.I went down for breakfast in the morning and it was... inedible. Dried out cucumbers, gummy tomatoes, and very low-quality sliced meats, along with utterly undrinkable dishwater coffee. I had a stomach-ache for the rest of the day. The next room they showed us was slightly less run down, but not pleasant. It was clear to me that if we stayed here we would be constantly annoyed at the problems with the hotel, which was also located at the bottom of a very steep climb up to the main streets. (Close in distance doesn't mean an easy walk!) The staff was conciliatory and everyone we interacted with was pleasant. But they kept trying to ""help"" us when we didn't need it. My boyfriend knows Istanbul very well and we didn't need to have a long talk about city options and guides and tours, etc. Though we said this several times, the staff members kept offering us one more alternative and one more. This might be great for people who don't know the city at all and didn't make plans beforehand, but if you're an organized and knowledgeable traveller it's a tedious and irritating delay to starting the day.When we walked up to town it was immediately clear that there were many more elegant hotels, with equally pleasant staff, at about the same price and in a better location. We found one, called down to the Basileus and they agreed we could cancel the rest of our reservation at no charge. We went back and did this, but there was a weird interaction about the refund and the ""discount"" (no discount at all, it turned out) on the one-night price we did pay. Right before the transaction went through the staff member asked me what I would write on TripAdvisor. When I explained that I would write exactly what happened, and that I could definitely say the staff was pleasant and helpful, this staffer started explaining that a bad review would affect his livelihood. I couldn't put my finger on anything specific, but I felt coerced and as if disagreement could affect the refund process, so I clammed up about the review, smiled and nodded, paid the money and left. But it did leave a bad taste in my mouth.Bad reviews do affect people's perceptions of a hotel, but they should also encourage hotels to improve their offerings. Pleading for good reviews, or making people feel guilty about leaving bad reviews is, in my opinion, unethical.The best hotels are the ones that you can stay in without thinking much about them. When everything is as it should be, I barely think about the hotel--I think about the city I'm in. Excellent hotels don't have to be fancy, but they must not have flaws that constantly irritate--and this was the problem with the Basileus. I was irritated from the moment I walked in the door and irritated when I checked out. I had no such feeling about the next hotel, for which I paid very little more.","September 12, 2018","3    Basileus Hotel

The apartment is very well equipped, the bathroom is great, the decor is fabulous and there's a washing machine. We didn't cook as there were so many great eating places nearby, but the kitchen had everything you could need. Plenty of space for us and our luggage. Before we arrived we were a little worried that there was no living area (although there is a dining table and chairs in the kitchen), but we didn't miss this at all and it was more than made up for by the fabulous rooftop terrace - watching the sunset over the old city from there is just amazing.We particularly liked that you could choose to have a light service (rubbish removed and clean towels) every day without additonal charge. Much easier than trying to find out where to put rubbish and when it's collected.We also loved the location, a quick walk to the Galata Tower and the tram to go to the old city. it's a fascinating area to stroll around with lots of fabulous eating places and shops, some traditional and some very trendy!

Zeynep arranged our airport transfers and Urgur met our car and provided much needed help with our luggage. The roof room and terrace are very special, perfect for a glass of wine at night or breakfast in the morning (those stairs are worth the effort). The location is perfect - close to the Galata Tower, shopping and restaurants on Istiklal Street in one direction, a short walk down the hill to the Galata Bridge and across to the Spice Market or Grand Bazaar in the other. On a slight downside we did have all-night street works right under our windows! This was completely beyond the control of Baylosuites of course, but they left us a much appreciated bottle of wine with a note of apologies. So although it was rather noisy at night, it was also fascinating to see how a street could be a dug up mess one evening, and by early the next morning had a road surface complete with paving pattern (and we did make a special effort to watch one night just to see how that pattern was made!). So please stay at Baylosuites, enjoy the beautiful building and great location ... and appreciate the newly paved road out front. I would certainly stay again.","November 7, 2015","4    Baylosuites

221,"Just back from a long trip. Staying at Zeynep's is a five star experience. I couldn't have been happier. Wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone who looks for a tasteful, pristine clean, comfortable place with a thoughtful, responsive and friendly host to stay in Istanbul for a few days.Zeynep's apt is just 1-2 min walk from Galata Tower. After traveling around the city, the Galata Tower area still remains to be my fav neighborhood. Walkable to all major tourist attractions, tram, interesting with cafés, restaurants and shops, yet the area maintains its residential feel, and Zeynep's apt is on a quiet street. The building itself is brand new and very tastefully renovated. I myself couldn't have done a better job to it, if it were my own place. There's only one apt on each floor, so it's very quiet at night. The building door remains closed at all times, so I feel very safe staying there. In-room facilities provide all modern comfort and there's great attention to detail. Zeynep's mother is running an art gallery downstairs and she helped with choosing a lot of paintings in the room which I like a lot. I especially like the morning writing desk at the room which gives the room a bit of 19th century touch.There's a lovely terrace on the rooftop where Zeynep furnished nicely as well. I brought my breakfast up there in the morning to listen to the humming of seagulls and watch the mosque in the sunset. A great summer time spent there.Lastly I enjoyed Zeynep and her family's hospitality. Zeynep is very responsive and considerate in all email exchanges. I got to met and chat with her mother who speaks very good English, showed me some work in her gallery and gave me great advice on taking the cruise. Ugur met me at the door the morning I checked in at 6am, and he was very nice and helpful throughout. So all in all, a very friendly and lovely experience, and I couldn't be happier. Hope I will visit again :)","July 31, 2015","4    Baylosuites

Zeynep, Selmin, and Ugur were so kind to us from the moment that we arrived. All three made us feel very much at home during our time in Istanbul. The second floor apartment where we stayed was impeccable and really showed the pride that Selmin and Zeynep take in this late 19th century building. We also really enjoyed preparing breakfast each morning in the apartment’s small kitchen which had a table overlooking a charming street below. It was a great way to start the day before touring. The shared rooftop terrace was also fantastic and a perfect spot to enjoy a glass of wine while watching the sunset over the Golden Horn.

We were very happy to have ascertained to have made the right choice out of all those AirBnB and other houses offered. Of the four available Baylosuites apartments we had chosen the “Classic” on the first floor. The three of us really were at home there. The apartment was very clean, very comfortable, very quiet and very tastefully furnished. Of course we heared schoolgirls singing and talking on their way to school in the morning outside in the narrow street, but we didn’t bother; it is a remarkable quiet street right there in the noisy (but pleasant!) Galata-neighbourhood. Absolutely marvellous is the terrace on the top floor for common use. We enjoyed it very much to stretch our legs there with a cool drink at hand after strolling around town all day and watching the sunset on the Golden Horn-area. Ugur in the gallery at the groundfloor helped us with useful recommendations and answers to our questions. We thank him and the staff of Baylosuites for their services.

232,"We stayed at the Baylosuites for four great nights in September 2014. We were on the first floor (one floor above street level). The apartment was wonderful. It was neat and clean and well appointed. They have some staples in the fridge when you arrive. The little kitchen was great for making breakfast before a day of exploring. We ate out in the evenings but there is a market just a five minute walk away so you could have fixed a larger meal of you wanted. The bathroom is lovely with a powerful rain head shower. The bedroom is spotless and the bed was great. The area served us well as a base to explore. We have stayed over in Sultanahmet as well and we much preferred the Galeta neighbourhood to the chaos across the bridge. Be warned, Galeta is one big hill and you often find yourself hiking up the hill at night to get home. The hotel is close to the tram (5 minutes down the hill to the base of the bridge) and getting around was easy. Deanna helped us a lot and often made dinner reservations for us or helped to plan an outing. Taksim is a pretty lively neighbourhood especially at night. It's a fun place to walk from the hotel and takes about 15 minutes to walk home in the evening.We loved the Baylosuites and would go back in a heartbeat.","September 29, 2014","4    Baylosuites

Yes you can believe all the positive 5 star reviews from other people who have stayed - worth the steep climb every time. In addition to the comfort, views and brilliant location for visiting both the old city and Galata, we were offered other little kind touches to make our stay so successful, for example, filtered water from the tap in the kitchen enabling us to drink safely. Reasonable priced wine in the cabinet on the floor next to the upstairs balcony (we found restaurant prices for wine very expensive and enjoyed coming home to a glass on the balcony in the evening). The effective air conditioning was very welcome on the especially humid days as were the bathroom facilities for frequent showers. Also the willingness of all the staff team to help and the offer of an emergency number to call if we needed help. They found extra things we needed which are too many to mention in this review. Deanne was a fount of knowledge about places to visit and will help with reservations and ordering reliable taxis that will come to the door and do not over charge.

It was a great place to recover from our flights; we especially appreciated that the kitchen had been stocked with basics so we didn't have to go out until we were rested and ready. The location on a minor street several blocks from Galata Tower and Istiklal in one direction and from Karakoy in the other suited us very well, much better than crowded Sultanahmet. The apartments are tastefully furnished and provide more than the basics in an efficient IKEA kitchen. It was nice to have the second bedroom (which has a convertible bed) as a dressing room as the rooms are generally rather small. Ditto for the bathroom, though the shower is great. The staff was very friendly and helpful, even offering to do errands like grocery shopping, ticket procuring, and emergency shoe repair. The shared patio was quiet and lovely with Bosphorous views.The only minus we wished we'd been made aware of is that the apartments are directly across the street from a school, and it is so close that there is no privacy with curtains or windows open.

The rooms are beautifully renovated with tasteful finishes and very comfortable. We used the rooftop garden to have a glass of wine while watching the sun set over this enchanting city. There were usually other guests up there and we had many enjoyable chats. There are only a small number of rooms and so there is a nice sense of intimacy but with ones own privacy when wanted. Situated just below the Galata tower it is in a prime location for seeing the sights, shopping or just pottering about in interesting little streets filled with shops cafes and bars to delight all senses.

The combination of technology and the historical environment is great as well, specially we really enjoyed the music system that youy could listen all of the World radio channels or listen to the playlist or create your own.:) The kitchen was really modern and had everything we needed as well, from tea to simit.

245,"There are very many pros and just a few cons. The pros are well documented and so I won't repeat.We stayed in the 3rd floor suite for six nights. This is very well appointed, and fairly spacious for one couple. There is one very funky, cumbersome aspect to this top floor suite. For some unknown reason, the entry door is set back from the stairs. (the floor plan on the website is not correct) and so you have two entry doors - one into the kitchen, and one into the foyer. So, when you are inside the suite, to get to the kitchen, you have to go through the tiny bedroom, which has two doors that swing into each other, making it a royal hassle to move to and from the kitchen. This could easily be fixed, and make the circulation far better, if the entry door were moved four feet out toward the stairway, just like the other floors. You kind of get used to it, but it really is a silly situation. The Baylo team really should seriously consider moving the door.Being that this suite is the top floor, it means that the fabulous roof terrace is directly above you. This is great since it is only a short flight up to morning coffee or evening wine. But, if you happen to have partiers in the other three suites in the building who use the terrace at night, or as a smoking lounge, as was the case for part of our stay, and you are can't sleep through this kind of thing, don't choose the top floor. There are signs up on the terrace to be considerate and quiet and all that, but even a mouse could not open the funky terrace door quietly, or climb the echo-y stairs quietly, or slide a metal chair quietly.The last, and most important, con for us is the grade school that is directly next to Baylo Suites. Unbelievably, we did not see any mention of this fact in any on the TA reviews. Imagine our surprise on Monday morning, our first jet-lagged morning in Istanbul, at 8:30 am the sounds of well over a hundred school children (grades one through six would be my estimate) and their school bus-vans began arriving directly outside the front door to Baylo Suites, and directly outside our bedroom window three floors down. I would call it extremely loud and noisy - probably impossible to sleep through and quite annoying unless you find the sounds of a children's playground soothing. There seemed to be an outdoor playground somewhere at the school that was continuously noisy from 8:30 to around 4:00 or so. We were always up before the 8:30 noise started, but for us the noise really shattered an otherwise peaceful morning, and we were usually out the door for sightseeing shortly thereafter. Most days, we returned home after school was over, and quiet, so we really weren't around all day to hear it. I didn't really want to be there during the day because of the noise.I would give Baylo Suites five stars if the street was as quiet as expected. It was generally quiet on the street outside at night and in the morning before 8:00 am since it is a residential street for at least a block in both directions.","May 27, 2013","4    Baylosuites

246,"Baylor suites is an absolute gem in the heart of Galata. About 100 metres from the Galata tower overlooking the harbour, it is an ideal location to explore Istanbul.We stayed in the top floor apartment. It has a separate bedroom, living room and kitchen. The apartments are really well appointed. There is an excellent kitchen, stocked with provisions for your first day although they lasted a few more for us. The bathroom is lovely, great shower, plenty of space to keep your toiletries, and towels. The apartment has good air conditioning too. Nothing was lacking.The assistance we had from Zeynep, Deanne, and Zenep's mother was fabulous. I was very unwell on one day of our trip and they went out of there way to find a doctor, locate a good hospital if required, and offered to get medicine if we need it. Fortunately none of this was required, but the extra effort was so greatly appreciated.Nearby there is a good supermarket, fruit stores, good baklava, everything you need for breakfast and a snack. We didn't cook other meals, why when there are so many choices in Istanbul.Above the top floor apartment there is a terrace which has great views of the old city, spice market and mosques. They have wine and beer available to drink on the terrace, with an honour system in place. Another very nice touch. If you have trouble with stairs this is not the place for you, firstly the apartment is in an old, beautiful building and there are tight stairs to go up and down. More importantly, Galata is very hilly, and much of the time you are either walking up or down. This adds to the charm and beauty of the place, but be aware of this before you book.There can be some street noise, particularly on Saturday night. It did not bother us, and other than Saturday it was quiet.This is a wonderful place to stay, incredibly friendly and helpful service, beautifully renovated apartments, and a great location.","May 23, 2013","4    Baylosuites

The apartments have been thoughtfully renovated so you have a sense of the old building while enjoying quality fittings including great showers. The location is very convenient - you can walk down to and across the Galata bridge to the main attractions. The rooftop garden gives you a sense of being in the city while you can relax with a drink and a game of backgammon. It's a sign of their service that the 'honesty bar' wine was only a few pennies more than you'd pay in the supermarket. True, there is the school in the mornings of weekdays, but this is not a city one visits to have a lie-in and the sounds of children going to school make you feel like a local resident! Most important of all were the staff who were a delight - Zeynep and her team went out of their way to accommodate our needs. They were always so cheery and happy to see us, and gave honest advice and offered little extra services - ordering taxis, looking things up about events, etc. We went to the islands for a break from the city but we left their early to return to Baylosuites!

248,"Firstly I would like to apologise to the lovely Zeynep hanim and her mum Selmin hanim for taking so long to post this review.We (husband, myself + 2 children - 7yrs and 7mths) stayed at Baylosuites from 6 July - 13 July finishing off a wonderful 6 weeks traveling around Turkey. We arrived in rather a dramatic fashion after having problems with the car rental company to find Selmin hanim (Zeynep was away when we first arrived) calm and sympathetic and ever so helpful. When we walked into our gorgeous apartment we instantly fell in love. It was even more beautiful than the photos on the website and spotlessly clean. Selmin hanim helped arrange food to be delivered to our suite even though it was late and made us feel very welcome.We stayed on the 2nd floor and it was perfect for our needs. From the lovely products in the bathroom to the comfortable bed it was perfect in every way! In the morning we found that the fridge had been stocked with enough to have a light breakfast! Everything had been thought of!! We sat every morning in the kitchen having our breakfast overlooking the street and beautiful beautiful buildings. The apartment has a luxurious feel. My husband really enjoyed the sonos system and as well as the large flat screen tv. The furnishings are beautiful and the apartment feel light and airy.We were very lucky as, from our second night, we were the only residents in the building and it made us feel even more special. I was a bit worried on our first day exploring when we discovered there was going to be a jazz concert up the road that evening (though I do love jazz) but i have to say we didnt hear a thing it was sooo peaceful and we enjoyed quiet nights every evening.The entire area is beautiful. We wandered the streets every evening with our 2 children and felt completely safe the entire time. The suites are so close to so many wonderful restaurants and cafes and there is even a jazz bar just up the street. You can walk to istikal street which is alive day and night and just the most amazing place to see. We had no problem getting around to the ferries or to the trams and found it is simply the most perfect location to explore Istanbul. The suites are situated on a hill which lead up to the galata tower but we just found it even more exciting and a bit of exercise.We met Zeynep a couple of days after we arrived and found her to be just as lovely as her mother. I cannot stress enough how helpful, kind, courteous and professional the service is. I had seen a restaurant reviewed in a travel book and had emailed to book, before we left for our holiday, but was told they would be closed during our stay. The restaurant happened to be across the road from the suites and were friends of Selmin hanim, who after speaking with the owners, managed to get us a reservation the night before they closed for their holidays! Wow! We were completely blown away, as we are from Australia we may never have had that opportunity again so it just an extra special gesture.On our last morning we decided to have breakfast on the roof terrace and were provided a selection of pastries to enjoy. It was a final gesture of hospitality that sealed our perfect stay.I have absolutely nothing negative to say other than we were very sad to leave!! We will without hesitation stay at Baylosuites again next time we are in Istanbul.Thank you again Zeynep and Selmin!!!! Wonderful!Duarte family xx","April 20, 2013","4    Baylosuites

249,Even before our arrival to the Hotel we had an excellent feeling about our stay : Zeynep responded to all our questions and queries without any delay and even proposed the car seat for the pick up for our little girl . During our stay the same attention was given to us and each time we needed something we received the service of a 5 star hotel ! The appartement is very well decorated; the terrace to which all the residents have access is beautiful. The kitchen is fully equiped and even for additional items Zeynep and her team arranged it for us (highchair for the meals of our girl) The location is also perfect as you can walk to Sultanahmet (around 45 minutes with a toddler) and the neighbourhood (Galata Tower) is really nice. We could do all our shopping in a supermarket which was not too far (Carrefour) and we had a shops next to our location. We will definetely recommend this hotel to our friends who will visit Istanbul. And if we return to Istanbul we will visit Zeynep and her team again.,"April 3, 2013","4    Baylosuites

250,"We loved that such attention was given to the renovation of these apartments. In a cityas large and complex as Istanbul, it is wonderful to see that people really care about their environment.There were very thoughtful touches in the apartment, such as fruit, bread, marmalade etc.for a first breakfast. Everything you need for a short stay in the kitchen. A good bed and nice bedlinen. The roof top terrace is wonderful.We stayed for eight nights and it is a great area, walking distance to lots of places. We found it to be quiet - and Zeynep and her staff made our visit memorable. They assisted us to have anamazing view of the fireworks on Republic night and also, with her mother, helped with a list of galleries to visit.Highly recommended and we hope to see you again!","November 16, 2012","4    Baylosuites

251,Others have raved about the good points of the Baylosuites apartments and I agree that they are clean and modern and well-located. Let me stress two other good things: there is no smoking in the building (a real plus in Istanbul) and the view is unbelievable with the Mosque of Suleyman the Magnificent front and center out the living room window of the third floor apartment. Two minor words of gentle complaint: the free Wi-Fi does not carry beyond the kitchen (ie no reception in the living room) and the windows are far from soundproof (I slept with earplugs every night). Overall a marvelous stay with lots of nice touches that will bring me back the next time I am in Istanbul. ,"October 19, 2012","4    Baylosuites

We had trawled the internet for variour hotels and apartments, and came across Baylosuites through Tripadvisor recommendations. The view from the terrace is stunning, and the apartment was perfectly presented; clean, modern and spacious.The location was fantastic, with local bars and restaurants only round the corner and the main tourist areas within walking distance - we walked everywhere from here, the location was so convenient. Zeynep and her team were superb, making us feel incredibly welcome and offered great recommendations for restaurants and places to visit. Nothing was too much trouble, and Zeynep even went out of her way to book us a restaurant for a special night - an excellent recommendation too!

254,"Baylo, what a gem in the heart of Istanbul! Baylo is located about 100 meters from Galata tower in Beyoglu district on the northern bank of the Golden Horn. My wife and I have been to Istanbul number of times and have stayed in few different neighborhoods including Sultanahmet (the historic/touristy area). During our first visit to Istanbul 12 years ago we fell in love with Bayoglu, a vibrant neighborhood with its pocket of Neo-classical and Art Nouveau apartment buildings amidst cobblestone narrow lanes, neat cafés, patisseries and small artsy boutiques. This is where the locals hangout. This trip we brought our two year old daughter with us to Istanbul for 4 days, and decided to rent an apartment in Beyoglu rather than stay in a hotel. Fortunately we came across Baylo website and we made our bookings. Baylo is truly “history meets 21st century”. We loved the Chic minimalist design while retaining the original 19th century building structure, walls, ceilings and the circular stairway. Every minute detail was thought through with perfection to make your stay comfortable. Zenap the charming host is a wealth of information and was always ready with a smile to assist us in providing suggestions and recommendations on things to do and see as per our interest. Zenap and her staff made our stay very special and personal. Although located in a lively neighborhood, Baylo is situated in a quite lane, so in the evening and morning it was very quiet. Just 100 meters walk to Galata tower, and you will have a buzzing nightlife.This place is perfect for those who want to see the historic sites during day time but also want to stay in a vibrant local neighborhood. It is only 5 minutes taxi ride to the historic old quarter of Sultanamhet , 10 minutes walk to the Spice Bazaar and walking distance to the tram and subway line.We will definitely revisit Baylo and we highly recommend this place.","September 25, 2012","4    Baylosuites

255,"I usually stayed in hotels during my travel, but this visit to Istanbul, I wanted to try to rent an apartment. I found Baylosuites in tripadvisor and it has amazing reviews. Once I checked out their website I immediately made my decision about staying there. These reviews are not lies, I had an amazing time and pleasant stay. I was fortunate that they have available unit for my travel date. I contacted Zeynep and she responded immediately. All arrangements had been so easy and I did not encounter any difficulties. The apartment is like what everyone is saying, it's nicely decorated, eco friendly, quiet at nights and it has everything you need. The terrace is amazing. We would go up to the terrace at nights and spent few hours just to chill and relax. Views are amazing during day or night. Location-wise, yes it is not in the middle of the all the historical places, but it's very close to Galata square and few meters away from Istiklal street that takes you to Taksim square which has lots of happening at night. To get to Sultanahmet, you can take a tram which is not far from the apartment and it's just a few stops away. The area is a bit hilly but if you don't want to walk, you could catch taxi or ask the friendly owner Zeynep to arrange you with one. She's attentive and very helpful. We really appreciated it when she let us to stay til afternoon since there was no one checking in to our apartment that day and we were able to spent another precious hour at the terrace :)","August 29, 2012","4    Baylosuites

257,"Baylosuites was a super place to stay. We were there for 4 days and 3 nights with our two little children and were absolutely happy with the apartment.1) Awesome location - steps from the Galata Tower and near lots of shops and restaurants. Also the funicular is right round the corner to bring you to the bottom of the hill from which you can walk across the bridge into Eminou and then to Sultanahmet. Or you can walk onwards along Istiklal Caddesi until you reach Taksim Square. 2) Super awesome host - Zeynep is a doll! She is very nice and accommodating, even letting us check-out very late since our flight was leaving late. She also was very helpful in finding us a good and reliable babysitter before we got to Istanbul. The babysitter works for a five-star hotel and was extremely competent caring for our kids while we went out for a nice dinner. Zeynep also gave us lots of good suggestions (in a great folder) for shops, etc.3) Really nice apartment - everything very new and comfortable. Cool looking design with nice furniture and super comfy beds. Ample space for our two kids. Great kitchen with basic amenities. They were even nice enough to provide essentials for breakfast! No cons for us here. The only thing is that the entire area is built on a hill so you do have to schlep up and down - good workout especially if you are lugging bags or carrying a 15kg child to the top of the hill!We really loved staying here and definitely recommend it to everyone else.","June 29, 2012","4    Baylosuites

The terrace has a great view and is perfect to relax after a day running around the city.Beyoglu is the new boheme neighborhood, where very nice renovated old buildings flourish, and singers and young people gather at night around Galata Tower.

Every picture on their website is perfectly accurate. We usually stay in hotels but because we were three, we wanted a flat. We felt at home while getting the service of a palace. Beds were comfortable, the view was amazing, bathroom was luxurious and spotless, the kitchen had everything we needed, the second room with a exactly what we wanted and the AC was amazing. The location is perfect: 1 minute from the Galata tower. Restaurants, coffee shops and small grocery shops nearby. The area is perfectly safe and quiet.

Bed was cozy, we purchased some of the towels they had, and the bath products were superior!! Location was just below the Galata Tower and there are many shops and food options. There was a music festival going on when we were there so the streets were full of people and fun things to do like marbling and art activities.

Bathroom was probably average size for a smaller European hotel, but I had plenty of room. The breakfast each morning is a simpler, traditional Turkish fare but delicious--fresh fruit, eggs, cheeses and breads. It's maybe a 3-5 minute walk to Sultanahmet/Hippodrome area (uphill though....) so the location is perfect. There's no elevator, but rather a set of somewhat narrow spiral stairs, so if you're claustrophobic or have vertigo or something, probably not the best idea. But the real draw of this hotel is the staff. I primarily saw Ayhan (I may not be spelling that correctly) and he was absolutely wonderful. I had booked a tour online that hadn't gone through, and he escorted me through the city personally to the tour office and waited while we sorted through everything, then showed me how to get an Istanbulkart (after trying to give me his). He was kind, personable and extremely generous with his time, and I'd stay there again just to be able to know he was handling anything I needed.

I had asked them to have some Red Bull for me for the when I checked in and they had it right there waiting on me for my check in! The place is clean and the food is good!

285,"It is hard to pinpoint one reason (only) why it is rated so highly.Is it the extremely friendly Ms. Cameron, the day manager, Furkan the night manager or the fact that it is so close to the Sultanahmet area? Up the hill, so you can burn off those carbs.It could be the cups of tea made on arrival, and whenever we got back from our trips. That was better than having tea making facilities in the room, as we got ""proper"" tea, not a stewed teabag.The rooms might not be large, but they are fresh and clean, and large enough. If you want to pay for international 5*, then go ahead. If you want a friendly family hotel, then come here.Thank you Cameron, and Furkan, and the team.

286,"I knew I was going to love my experience at the Walnut Shell before I arrived. Shortly after booking, I received an email from Cameron, the manager. Being a stickler for details, she patiently answered all my questions. Everything from the tours they offer to transportation and other traveling tips. She was informative and commited to giving us the best experience possible. So when we met it felt like reuniting with an old friend! The Walnut Shell is right in the middle of the action. You could literally walk to the Blue Mosque, Hagia Sophia and the Galata Bridge. Terrific dining, drinking, and shopping options are all within hundreds of feet. As a result, prices are higher than what locals may pay. The rooms are clean, a bit on the small side, but comfortable. The local touches cheer everything up on a cooler day. After a hours of exploring, my fiancé and I thoroughly enjoyed sipping Turkish wine on the balcony in our suite overlooking the Bosphorus. (Be sure to buy a bottle from the front desk!) For me, it was the service that set Walnut Shell apart. I was warmly greeted and recognized by all the staff members throughout our stay. Some of our best memories are sharing a cup of cay with Cameron and the other guests before departing ways. It all adds up to a delightful experience that we would certainly love to repeat!PS Be sure to arrange an airport pickup in you're flying into Sabiha G. as we did. We flew in at 6pm on a Friday and there was a lot of traffic. It took us almost 80mins to reach the hotel. We were grateful for the comfortable van and amiable driver they provided. It's worth every penny!PPS We did opt to do the True Blue ""Best of Istanbul Tour"" it was one of the highlights of our trip. Ask for Ugur!","October 24, 2016","5    Walnut Shell Hotel

297,"Nothing is too much trouble for the staff at this little jewel in the heart of Istanbul's Sulthanmet district. From the famous apple tea on arrival, the million dollar smile of the lady preparing our breakfast, to sharing a glass of the excellent Turkish wine, the staff are the biggest strength of this hotel. But there are other things to note too...On checking in I wasn't sure what to expect but with 5 circles from just about every guest I expected something close to perfection. So first impressions - well the reception is every bit of beautiful as the pictures, but when we went up to the room at first I wondered what the fuss was about. It goes without saying that the rooms are spotless, but they're not large, and then after a few minutes looking around it dawned on me how clever the use of space inside them is. When you consider that this historic wooden house is in the old quarter of Istanbul, then you realise how perfect the rooms are. The bathroom ""appears"" small too, but at 15 stone I'm hardly svelte and I had no issue there either. You go to bed and - there's a bedside light above you so you can read. Every little detail has been catered for. Which says to me the owners have stayed in the rooms and thought hard about how to improve your stay. Either that or I had stepped into the Tardis.Location wise, this is pretty much as good as it gets - the hotel is near a number of shops, restaurants and bars, and indeed we ate at a little place overlooked by our room on the first night. The Blue Mosque and Aya Sofia, and the Grand Bazaar are but a short walk away, and you can get a tram quite easily to the Galata bridge and surrounding area.Incidentally staying here you will undoubtedly not need to eat lunch. The breakfasts have both a buffet style spread of traditional Turkish foods, and then the young lass in the kitchen cooked us a variety of fantastic hit accompaniments. God knows how much French toast I put away in one sitting, but the missus had to roll me up the hill later.Nothing is ever too much trouble for the staff, and although Turkey is famous for its hospitality, and the Turks we met such kind and polite hosts, they excelled. There are staff on duty 24 hours, and even when we were setting out very early morning for a trip to Gallipoli they was a young man rubbing the sleep out of his eyes and eager to help us. Had we been down earlier we could have had breakfast too. My only hope on writing this is that the hotel continues to flourish, and all the staff are safe following the recent outrage in Sulthanmet. We gained so much respect for Turkey and her hard working, generous people during our stay.","February 3, 2016","5    Walnut Shell Hotel

Here you are greeted in a very different way with a genuine interest along with coffee/tea and cookies. We spent many hours talking with Furkan (night) and Cameron (day). It was such a pleasant and learning experience for us. They both treated us like family - something I have never experienced before. The service was A-class! The breakfast was filling with high nutritional value. Fresh complimentary tea, coffee, water and juice all day. Very cozy kitchen. We made several new acquaintances from various countries. Simply amazing. The rooms were relatively small but big enough for us. Great bed. Mini-bar. Good warm shower.Location is good. Near many attractions and restaurants in the old town. About 10 min walk to tram station which connects you to most of Istanbul.

315,"The Walnut Shell Hotel was a true joy to stay at. It was located in Sultanahmet 4-5 blocks from the Blue Mosque and Hagia Sophia in a fairly quiet area, especially for the Sultanahmet neighborhood.The staff at the Walnut Shell was extremely accommodating and helpful and made sure that we were comfortable at all times. They provided great tips on how to get around the city and what attractions to see. I'm especially grateful for this, since we would have missed a few had it not been for the staff here.The room was very small, but clean and well furnished. It was quiet, however, and the bathroom was more than adequate. If we would have planned on spending a lot of time in the hotel, then the size of the room would have been more of a factor but Istanbul is too beautiful of a city to not go out and enjoy it! Overall, it was an exceptional value and more than what we expected.They served excellent breakfasts both mornings we were here; even the morning we left for the airport at 5 in the morning. It wasn't a full breakfast (the previous day included the full spread of fresh fruits, eggs, olives, and crepes), but it was great nonetheless and more than we expected since we were leaving so early.We took Hotel arranged transfers both to and from the airport which were on time and comfortable. I recommend that service.I highly recommend the Walnut Shell Hotel. It was a great location with a great staff that is in the heart of Sultanahmet.","June 25, 2015","5    Walnut Shell Hotel

320,"I spent 5 nights at the HasHan Galata Hotel and very highly recommend it. The hotel is located very conveniently in Beyoglu, a short walk from the Galata Tower and the many bars/restaurants/shops that make Beyoglu such a fun, vibrant scene. The tram that goes to Sultanahmet (where many tourist attractions are) is only a 5 minute walk from the hotel, so getting places is easy. Our room was a suite on the ground floor, with possibly the most comfortable bed of my entire life and a luxuriously large, modern bathroom. The interior decoration is extremely chic and modern, and the staff very helpful and nice--expecially Zeynep, who was absolutely lovely. The breakfast didn't have that many options but it was great nonetheless, and ultimately had everything I really wanted.

322,"I stayed at the Has Han Galata for 3 nights in mid August last year. Prior to my arrival, I contacted Zynep to see if she could obtain tickets for some of the attractions in Istanbul for me. Zynep was very helpful and assured me that the tickets will be ready at my arrival. I booked a deluxe room, and Zynep contacted me prior to my arrival to inform me that I was upgraded to a deluxe suite. Check-in was a breeze, and our room was ready before the required chek-in time which was very much appreciated after a 10 hour flight. Zynep also had the tickets to the attractions ready as promised. The deluxe suite which was located on the 3rd floor was extremely beautiful, clean, very roomy and they had some Turkish delights on the bed. The bathroom was the biggest one I have yet to find in a hotel with all the top amenities to include shampoo, soap and even a little set of toothbrush. There are no elevators, and you need to take the stairs to go to the rooms. This could be a problem for someone with mobility issues; however, they do carry your luggage to your room when you get there. Has Han Galata is located in a very quiet area and is in a fantastic location in Karakoy. There are some really great restaurants nearby the Galata Tower with a very good nightlife. It is also very safe. The tram to Sultanamhet is about a 3 minute walk and takes about 10 minutes to get you the city center where most of the major attractions are located. Their complimentary breakfast is very good but doesn't have that many choices. However, it is enough to fill you up until lunch. I told them the day of my arrival that I was going on a cruise, and would need a taxi to take us to the cruise terminal around 1 pm. To my surprise, Baran called my room on my last day there to tell me that the taxi was waiting outside and I did not even have to remind them. That is exceptional service! I had a fantastic stay in this beautiful boutique hotel and I would definitely stay there again if I were to come back in Istanbul. ","January 4, 2016","6    Has Han Galata

325,"Just thinking again about Has Han Galata makes me smile. There is so much to like with this small (9 room) boutique hotel. The rooms are unusually large, made to feel even more so because of the high ceilings. The bright color themes and old photos on the walls help connect the modern decor with the history of the building and immediate area. The beds were super comfortable with good lighting. Bathrooms are exceptional, very roomy with white marble, upgrade sink and toilet. Our bathroom had a claw-foot tub and a spacious separate glassed-in shower. Towels were fluffy and smell fresh. Bathroom amenities are top end. Wifi was quick and consistent (and free). The free breakfast was simple and satisfying in a nice clean, bright space. The location is a major plus too. The hotel location is close to many key sites in the Beyoglu area - the Galata Tower, Taksim, Cukurcuma (antiques), the Istiklal Caddesi area (shops and bars), a Ottoman Bank museum across the street, and only two blocks from the Galata Bridge. You can either walk the bridge to Sultanahmet for many of the top historical sites or take the inexpensive tram.But, the biggest reason to select Has Han Galata are the staff. The hotel manager, Zeynep Inanc, is just a pleasure; friendly, thoughtful, and eager to see her rather new and blossoming hotel stand out. Her staff are equally helpful. Upon our arrival in Istanbul after being awake for over 20 hours, including a 10 hour flight from the US, we must have looked like the ""walking dead"". We were tired and hungry. When I asked if there was a restaurant they would recommend, they not only gave us the name. Orcun, the assistant manager, personally escorted us to the restaurant two blocks away. By the way, the restaurant was outstanding. From the free taxi pick up at the airport to the calm Labrador puppy at the hotel's entrance to the unique circular steps adjacent to the hotel, there is just so much to like. My wife and I wish this small hotel the very best in the future. ","October 4, 2015","6    Has Han Galata

As for the actual hotel, it is absolutely beautiful. The room we stayed in was pretty big with extremely high ceilings and large windows. The staff working at the hotel are very nice and go above and beyond in order to make your experience there truly great. There were two instances were they helped us make dinner reservations (which was really helpful considering our Turkish was pretty terrible) and they even offered to upgrade our room free of charge when a bigger room became available. Finally, their complimentary breakfast was extremely good and there was a large variety of options to choose from (Pancakes, oatmeal, eggs, etc).

Everything about this hotel is lovely, from its location next to the Kamondo Stairs below Galata Tower, to the historic 19th century building and conversion to a hotel, to the interior design (which includes many beautiful textiles and objects from nearby hiç crafts) and countless small thoughtful details (including Turkish delight in the brass bowl on the bed and candles, with matches), to the delicious breakfast buffet. But above all, the staff, from those who greeted me upon arrival to those in the breakfast room (smiling when I placed the same coffee and egg order four days in a row). I am an architect and was so pleased with the clever detailing in the room. Case in point - the way the shower and toilet compartment (with a mirrored door, which obscured it from the view of the rest of the room) was tucked into one corner. This both free-ed up other space in the room (making it quite gracious) and allowed for natural light to reach the shower itself, while keeping the toilet area private. My only suggestion for improvement would be to add a bit more lighting above the lavatory.And, because I am a bit OCD, I have to state for the record that the room was spotless.Finally, I wanted to thank the staff for their assistance. I had a bit of a personal emergency during my time in Istanbul, and the staff was very helpful in assisting me with this.","August 5, 2015","6    Has Han Galata

I have visited Istanbul several times in the past, but it was a first time visit for my fiancé, and so I was keen for it to be special.I booked a deluxe room and emailed the hotel before arrival to request the room with the round bathtub. This request was received, and when we arrived, we were informed that we would indeed be getting the room that I had requested (Room 201). The room was perfect: the bed was comfortable and the bathroom incredible. The shower was a ""monsoon"" shower and the bath simply huge. The room itself was also spotless, and the towels and soaps, along with everything else, were replaced daily. What really sets this hotel apart, however, is the service. I believe the fact that the hotel is a smaller, boutique hotel, has a part to play in this. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff working there. We got all the help and advice that we needed. The lovely lady at reception booked us an early morning spot at the Ayasofya Hamam for the day that we checked out, and the kitchen was opened early for us to ensure we left with a full stomach! It was an example of true Turkish hospitality. Indeed, the staff at the hotel seem to take great pride in ensuring that their guests have a wonderful stay, not only in the hotel, but in Istanbul itself.Complimentary tea to our room was a simple gesture, but a really nice, personal touch, too.

355,"I've visited Istanbul regularly since 2010 for work and leisure and stayed in many touristy and non-touristy neighborhoods. Galata, is the best in the entire Beyoglu district in my opinion. It's got easy access to the most visited historical sights in Sultanahmet, it's very close to the famous Istiklal St. there are lots of good cafes, restaurants and bars in this area, still, you can stay away from all the hullabaloo..Has Han Galata, is a very elegant boutique hotel located on one of the quiet streets close to the Tower, in the heart of lively Istanbul still away from the noisy streets. The 9 rooms of this adorable building that used to serve as a postoffice are each designed fabulously by a frequent traveller who's used to running hotels and serviced apartments and therefore knows perfectly well how to meet some sophisticated needs of the guests. The team running this hotel are extremely friendly, doing their best 24/7 to provide the most memorable stay for their new-to-the-city guests as well as their regulars.I highly recommend this hotel for detail-oriented people who enjoy style, comfort and elegance.","November 24, 2014","6    Has Han Galata

402,"Taksim Ultra VIP apartments has apartments as seen in its 360 degree views. The apartments are very good, neat and clean and in good condition when you check in. So if you are looking for a spacious place near taksim square, this is certainly a good one. But be careful that the walk to get back is very steep and even though it's very close as the crow flies, getting back from the square is not something small kids can do easily specially if tired.The service and staff leaves a lot to be desired though. They will take all payment upfront and make you sign a huge contract. When they take you to the apartment, all AC remotes are placed in front of you and counted. You are then warned that misplacing any results in a fine. When you ask for basic toiletries like a body wash or a hand wash soap, they will tell you how they always have VIP guests who get their own toiletries and therefore almost implying that you are too cheap to ask for something as basic as a bar of soap. The same goes for if you ask for an iron. I would assume that if a washer is provided in the apartment, a clothes iron would also be available. The reason for that is that their so called 'VIP guests' have kids who jump around with the iron and spoil it. Thankfully there is a small departmental store right next door so toiletries are easily available. Be sure to keep a bottle of water with you if you are checking in late. There will be none provided in the apartment. And even though they promise housekeeping everyday, it will be conveniently 'forgotten' by the housekeeping staff. The manager will not really feel sorry for it either. We were two families travelling with kids and the 4 bedroom apartment was no doubt comfortable. I would give 4 stars for the apartment and zero for service.","July 10, 2015","7    Taksim Ultra VIP Apartments

As the kids are all young adults now, we really enjoyed the space in the apartment and it provides for so much better interaction than several hotel rooms. The apartment is centrally located and a short walk, down hill to the tram ( to Sultanahmet etc..) and uphill back. It is also an easy walk to Changir Square and Taksim square with many good choices of restaurants and shops. In front of the apartment is a taxi stand, several restaurants and a grocery shop. Clean, very updated, good security, and onsite manager and staff. Host is available to plan excursions, airport pickups and the like.

415,"The Taksim Ultra VIP apartments lived up to their name and provided us with a great base for exploring the fascinating city of IstanbulThe apartment which we had hired for my father's 80th birthday celebrations is located in Cihangir and has a steep hill to get to it from the seafront which was the only negative. However its incredibly close to transport - you just jump on the tram at Findikli and you're straight over the Galata bridge and into the historic old town, the Bazzars and the mosques. Theres also a Taxi rank outside.The apartment was incredibly clean, warm and well heated and gave 3 good sized double beds and a single bed out onto a balcony. 1 double was en suite, and there was a separate bathroom (with a shower with radio!) and a separate toilet. The ideal space though was the kitchen/living area - huge sofas, dining table and fully equipped kitchen, with huge windows opening up onto the quite quiet street (for a town) below . Apartment had wifi, and the owners were very quick with all responses to questions before and during visit.

423,"Hotel is so far away from everything, at least 45min from the airport and 45min to the city. If the traffic is jammed expect to spend over an hour in a cab. Staff is relatively friendly, however, they are not too helpful. We asked the guest relations to recommend us a place to go out for dinner. She gave us options, made the booking and called a cab (which was very nice of her and I appreciate it) however when we came to the restaurant they told us they were closing within 30min so we had to rush through dinner, barely finished our drinks and were practically kicked out to wait for a cab at least 15min in front of the restaurant. I don't understand why would she send us to a place which is closing. On another occasion, we wanted to book a Bosphorus cruise, they told us only evening tour is available. Just by opening Google, you can see these tours are conducted all day long. In the end, they put us in a cab and were dropped off to some ferry terminal to board a boat as per their recommendation which was horrendous. Airport shuttle they advertise goes 3 times a day and takes an additional hour to get to the hotel/airport. Room was nice and spacious, very clean too.","May 4, 2019","8    Elite World Business

424,"Possibly the worst customer service of anywhere I have stayed in the world. Myself and my partner checked in for one night, everything was going well, we were shown to our room which was a lovely touch. We had a room with balcony, views of aircraft taking off, fantastic. We were flying out the next day so decided to order room service dinner and relax for the evening. We went to phone to order the room service and our room phone wasn’t working. I had to walk down to reception to order, which defeats the purpose! Anyway, we ordered a huge meal, salad, pasta, burger, two alcoholic drinks and dessert. It arrived to our room in about 30 mins. Quality was not amazing as you would expect from a 5 star hotel but it was edible. Our total came to around €30 including delivery, great value. We decided to be lazy and eat in our room the next morning, we filled out the breakfast room service card, left it outside our room and got up the following morning expecting breakfast to the room. Breakfast was included in our room price, so we decided to get it to the room, and usually there is an extra small fee, which is completely fine. I opened our door to find the room service card still hanging on the door handle! Again, I had to go down to reception, at this stage very angry, to hand in the form stating what we wanted for breakfast. Breakfast arrived minus a few things we ordered, down I go again to ask for the forgotten items. Upon check out we were landed with a bill for room service (dinner), absolutely fine, and a bill for the room service breakfast which was also for €30. I queried this with reception staff, who explained to me that yes breakfast was included in our room rate, but room service was not. I have never paid more than €10 for breakfast to be delivered to a hotel room before. I then queried how a dinner of so much food and alcoholic drinks came to the same amount as breakfast. They kept saying this was the rate of having breakfast delivered to the room, pretending they didn’t understand English when I got upset. I am shocked and outraged, they completely ripped us off. We paid a lot of money to stay here for one night and for them to have the cheek to charge us extra for breakfast was ridiculous. Our stay was ruined. Only we had to leave for the airport I would not have paid this. I emailed as soon as I got home to complain and got given the same excuse from the manager. He offered us a suite and free meal on our next stay. I would never stay here again after how they treated us. Awful customer service. ","April 25, 2019","8    Elite World Business

The room service was a delight and well priced, I wouldn’t hesitate to use this if you are staying with the hotel. The hotel offers a free shuttle to the attractions which is very helpful as it will stop at Sultanahmet, Emininou or Taksim from which you can transit to most places in Istanbul.

438,"Stayed at the Elite World Business on a stop over on the way to Johannesburg. Finding the hotel's shuttle at Ataturk was a little cumbersome, but not too difficult. The drive down to the hotel took about 20 mins due to traffic. The hotel - its lobby and restaurants - are well furnished and well kept. Our room too was a decent size and of an acceptable standard. Staff were mostly pleasant, though we found the one of the bell boys to be utterly useless. Dining was also a bit of a miss - we didn't care for the hotel's breakfast or dinner at it's restaurant or in room dining. Another issue is that the hotel doesn't allow access to the pool without a swimming cap - an unusual rule which I have not encountered elsewhere.Behind the hotel there are quite a few shops including some bakeries and a large Gloria Jeans. It's about 15 mins in a taxi to the Mall of Istanbul, though there are quite a few other shopping centres in the vicinity too. We quite liked the hotel's free shuttle to Taksim - a fairly uncommon yet useful feature at hotels this far from the city centre.Overall, Elite World Business offers decent value accommodation; there some issues, but it was fine for a short layover. When Istanbul Yeni Airport is fully functional the hotel will obviously lose much of its value, but for now it's certainly an option worth considering.","November 25, 2018","8    Elite World Business

I liked that it had a huge variety of traditional Turkish food but also offered options you would find in a typical continental breakfast.

Checked into the hotel, beautiful foyer, friendly staff and a nice comfortable, clean and spaceous room. As other reviewers had suggested, we asked the doorman for directions to the local eatery around the back of the hotel - Saraykapi Sac (walk through the petrol station and turn right, its just there) which was just fabulous. Very comfortable room, quiet, even though we were facing the busy road, and we had a lovely breakfast before using the shuttle back to the airport , early morning. Overall a very nice hotel, nice staff and great choice for a stopover, if you don't need to be in the centre of Istanbul city itself.","October 23, 2018","8    Elite World Business

442,"Stayed for 1 week and most staff do not speak English. During my stay i got to know an aged couple staying at the same hotel, we became friends. Sunday morning the wife lost her gold bangle which her husband bought for her as a gift from Istanbul itself. Expecting a Manager on duty to assist us by looking at the cctv but the respond we got was, No Managers are on duty on Sundays. We were disappointed, a staff from the coffee house managed to locate the missing bangle and returned it to the folks. When we tell you we need to pee, do you tell us pee tomorrow?The only plus point about the hotel is that shuttle bus is provided to airport, Taksim, Sultanahmet and Grand Bazaar. Other than that, room service menu needs lots of improvement knowing that plenty of cafes round the corner of the streets that offer better cheap quality food. For guests that prefer indoor room dining, hotel can look into improving room service menu.","October 18, 2018","8    Elite World Business

451,I chose Elite World Business Hotel for one night layover and for its supposed to be 1.7 mile distance on Expedia to the Ataturk airport as Expedia claims but it took me some 20 minutes with normal traffic. The ride took a lot of turns and U turns. The 1.7 miles may be a straight line distance on the map but I felt like more than 10 mileslong. The Hotel is located on a major road and right next to a gas station that I could hear a lot of car and road noises. I do not recommend this hotel as an airport because of the time it takes to the hotel. ,"July 15, 2018","8    Elite World Business

454,"I attended a wedding reception at this hotel. Nice surroundings with lots of marble and glass. I took the elevator to the reception floor, the elevator doors closed but the elevator did not move. Another passenger pushed the button to open the doors but nothing happened, We were stuck inside the full elevator, Pushed several other buttons, including the alarm button, still nothing. When pushing the alarm button we could hear the bells ringing, but no help arrived. The elevator was full including some elderly passengers, and it was getting difficult to breath and very warm inside the elevator. One of the Turkish speaking passengers took the emergency telephone and spoke to someone who responded ""we are getting help"" but still nothing. In the absence of any assistance forthcoming, I inserted my pocket comb between the elevator doors and managed to force the doors open. We all breathed a sigh of relief. and exit the elevator and took the stairs. This could have ended with tragic results. I was surprised at the casual attitude of the lobby staff and their cavalier attitude toward emergency assistance.If you are staying in this hotel make sure you stay close to the ground floor, as in case of fire or other emergency you may have to fend yourself without any help from the outside.","June 24, 2018","8    Elite World Business

458,"Had another good two-day stay at this excellent hotel on a layover between flights. The breakfast options are good as usual and the service impeccable. The only issue I had was with the massage service in the spa downstairs. I ordered an 80-minute massage but the masseuse, Yedi (sp.?) finished after 65 minutes. Towards the end I had asked her, as gently as I could, to please lighten up on her touch; she was working with extremely strong pressure on my head and face. She ignored my request and, after I asked her a second time to please be more gentle she promptly stopped and left the room. Although the massage itself was not very skilled, it was still acceptable until the end; but to finish a treatment 15 minutes early because of a simple client requst is unacceptable in a hotel of this class. The next day I got a 20 minute shoulder massage at the airport which did me more good than the whole 65 minutes at the hotel. Why? Because the therapist was skilled, that's all.","June 2, 2018","8    Elite World Business

460,"We stayed here for a few nights either side of our trip to Jordan. It is close to the airport so within 5 or 10 minutes you can be at the hotel, good if you have had a long flight. Check in was swift and the rooms are well appointed, although a coupleof the rooms at the end of the corridoor have an odd fearture of a structural pilar going through the room! The restaurants were nice to relax in and overall the staff were really friendly. We did have a bit of confussion on our return, as we arrived early in the morning (5am) I did book for the previous night so as we could get to our room when we arrived. I emailed the hotel asking them not to cancel our booking and think we were a no show as we hadn;t turned up by 10PM as we were in fact turning up early the next morning. I got a reply from them stating that it was there policy that check in was afternoon but I may be lucky if I wait until after 8am and a room became free that i could check in earlier. Luckily when I arrived there was no issue but until then I was a bit aprehensive that they might make us wait for hours in the lobby. For getting into Istanbul, they do offer a shuttle bus twice a day, other than this it's either by taxi (allow enough time due to traffic) or there is a metro bus not far if you are confident using them, but they did always look crowded.","May 23, 2018","8    Elite World Business

They have a free airport shuttle bus that come every hour on the half hour however the bus never turned up at the scheduled time.

466,We stayed here for five days having moved from other accommodation close to Taksim because we were unhappy with the standard. Here was a smart hotel which although it was mikes from anything it did offer transport into the main part of the city and also airport transfers. The room was large and spacious but lacked intimacy. Maybe too clean and clinical for me. Although tea and coffee facilities were in the room the hotel failed to replenish on a daily basis. On the second day I went down to reception and told them about this but the following three days they failed to replenish the tea and coffee. Ok so this is a tiny thing but when you wake up at 6 am and really just want that first cuppa there’s nothing more annoying when you can’t have one because nothing is open and you have nothing in the room.

472,"On arrival of the hotel the lobby was very grand and impressive. We checked in without much hassle, queried about upgrading the room to a suite but was told it was £30 extra, EACH NIGHT! So we decided to stay with the room that we had.There was no luggae service so had to see ourselves to the room, would be nice to have had a luggage service. The room appeared clean and spacious. It ha da stocked mini bar and bathroom was clean. We asked at reception about somewhere local to eat with local cuisine and was recommended a local restuarant behind the hotel (I cant remember the name of it) but it was lovely and we went there for a 2nd night later on in the week so definitely worth a visit!On the downside, the housekeeping was something to be desired. It appeared like they only remade the beds in the morning and didnt change the sheets. One day the cleaner just walked in the bedroom without even knocking on the door, we told her to get out and then a few seconds later she walked back in again?! On this same day, we had to ask reception to get someone to go back and clean out room. On the first request they didnt do it, so we had to ask a second time! Also, we had items from the mini bar on the first night. This was not restocked at all through the week. The toilet roll wasn't filled up so had to ask for more toilet roll as the cleaners didnt do this. We ate in the restaurant in the hotel on one night. It was ok, nothing special. We ordered room service a few nights, and although the menu was limited, the food was better tasting than the restaurant and service was quick. It was at our room in 20 minutes. So it would have been better if they had a more extensive room service menu. A few days we needed a taxi to get in to central Istanbul, this was requested at reception and only took a few minutes to arrive, so big thumbs up on this point. Traffic getting in to Istanbul is a nightmare though, cost abour 60-100 TL each way! Overall though, the hotel was nice and the staff friendly.

The staff were all excellent and friendly and we very much enjoyed chatting to Deniz during our rooftop breakfasts. The location is also splendid although you should take care to note landmarks or take a map so you can easily find the little road again. There is an abundance of restaurants and merchants just a short walk uphill with very fresh and varied produce. Istanbul can certainly be bewildering and it is most valuable to have such a friendly oasis. The city is very friendly, but can be a little overwhelming. If you don`t speak Turkish then buy a phrasebook and practise a few useful phrases like `please`, `thankyou` or `good morning`.

491,"For reference, my wife and I traveled with our 1-year-old son.Quick takes:English speakingBest neighborhoodNo noise problemsGreat rooftop terraceSupremely friendly and helpful owner and staffNo crib (we took a pack N play)Standard Turkish breakfastFirst and foremost, this was the perfect location for our trip. Close to the best restaurants, bars, ice cream, clothing boutiques for both men and women, and shops of all kinds, we could have happily spent our entire trip in Upper Beyoglu. It takes some time (~30 minutes) to get to both the Asian side and Sultanhamet (we never went by cab), but we easily visited both (and we traveled with an infant).Second, they were extremely accommodating. They arranged the room to create more space for his pack n play (NOTE: they did not have a crib at the time of our visit), went out of their way to help for breakfast, and were so welcoming and kind that our son jumped into their arms every morning.We had the balcony room, which is standing only, but was nice to have. We had no problems with noise.We spent extensive time on the rooftop. It was a very safe place for our son to run around and push chairs, affording a nice view of the city and a great place to enjoy at night. We went up there every night (with a baby monitor in hand).Finally, the proprietor, Deniz, was not only extremely friendly and helpful, but the perfect food resource. All of her restaurant suggestions were absolutely phenomenal (and ultimately supported by the listings found in Culinary Backstreets - also recommended). She walked us to a beautiful restaurant and spoke with the maitre'd to ensure we got a table. And the manager, Ozan, became our son's best friend.Finally finally, do yourself a huge favor and get a shave a few doors down. It'll change your life.","October 19, 2014","9    Dila Suites

Balik street has a number of renovated old houses that have been converted into ""boutique hotels"", with Dila Suites among them.The rooms were comfortable and very tastefully decorated, with satin beadspreads and curtains and large modern bathrooms with great showers. We took two rooms - the ground floor room with two single beds for our boys - and the first floor room that had a lovely bay window seat.Breakfast is served on the rooftop terrace - but as this was April - the month for tulips in Istanbul - and quite cool in the mornings, Denise served her wonderful breakfasts in the basement office.Denise was an excellent hostess.

There are loads of really nice restaurants around and the rooms are lovely. Beds are great and breakfast at the rooftop terrace is lovely.The bad: this is not a hotel! It's a B&B that charges hotel prices. There's no reception and you have to find the owner if you have any questions.The really ugly: many people find the owner extremely nice so this is purely my view as I found her very overbearing. The really bad thing happened when she booked us transportation to the wrong airport (simply because she didn't check, which she could have as she also arranged for us to be picked up from there) making us almost miss our flight. Worse, she didn't apologise but insisted we paid more money for the transfer as our airport was further away. She didn't even come to the phone herself but had one of her staff (who really is the sweetest thing ever) convey her message. We lost another 20 minutes here. I would not recommend this hotel mainly because of the owner and this incident.Overbearing when you don't want her to be and then not there when you do need her to pull through and be customer focused.","April 22, 2014","9    Dila Suites

520,"Booked Dila Suites early this year when they were #1. Last review very unfair and should have been barred. Our hosts Deniz and Ali are the BEST! They have lived in Istanbul for decades and know the city like the back of their hands. They gave us recommendations not immediately obvious from the guides and reviews. But I digress. The location is great. From the suites you walk up the street ladened with fish restaurants and just around the corner from the British embassy. At the top is Istiklal street. This is where the action is! Shopping, restaurants, cafes, clubs. One end is Taksim square, the opposite Galata tower and bridge. We had suite 103. Lovely antique furniture, large queen sized bed, and air conditioning. The bathroom /wet room was beautifully appointed with exhilarating rain shower, much needed after a hot humid day sightseeing. All was kept hygienically clean and tidy. We went to Istanbul for a rest and culture so didn't get to bed until midnight most days but didn't get up until after 10. Deniz was there waiting to make breakfast for us; continental with delish homemade jams and pastries and cake, balanced with fresh fruit and tomatoes. Great start to the day. We would chat frequently about our trips and she would offer alternative ideas for the day. Examples would be Kanyon shopping mall (Levent stop on the metro); Bebek town via a 10 tl ferry to Ortakay followed by 10 tl taxi, for seafood restaurant at the fine art gallery with fine dining.As for the dining.

521,"We have chosen DS because of good reviews but we had a terrible experience. When we got to the hotel we did not found any information on how to call someone to open the door. After waiting for a while we had no choice but make a phone call. Why not having an arrow at the door bell to call someone to open the door? After taking a shower to go out with to have dinner but when just at the corner we started feeling the effects at tear gas. I felt it first in the eyes and my daughter soon in her throat. We moved to other direction and walked away. However, when we came back the situation was worst. As police moved people from Taskim Square the use to protest at the surround and the hotel is only 15 min from it. The hotel street was full of people and tear gas was everywhere. We tried to run but I hit my leg on a street mini post. We were together with the receptionist but it was terrible to find the hotel door. Once in the room we thought our problems were solved. It took a while to feel better after feeling the gas. But suddenly we felt the gas inside the room. I decided to open the door room by more gas came from the stairs. Then I called the reception twice but no one answered. We had no choice at the time (going out and run could be worst) so we tried to put wet towels at the door gap to avoid more gas to come in. After that I decided to call Deniz and describe the situation to her. She asked the young man to come around and he finally opened the terrace door so the air could circulate from the stairs. We spent the night listening to people running and shouting and hearing the bombs. When I remember that I sent to e-mails to Deniz asking if the situation was safe and I had mentioned the tear gas weeks before she told me not to worry. I finally decided to leave the hotel and look for another one but she said ""if you leave it is your problem"". I asked for any money compensation, at the least for the next three days that I would pay for other hotel but the answer was ""no"". I explain that I well travelling with a 16 old girl and I was divorced I could not stay there anymore and leave the hotel after breakfast. I am not saying the hotel is not good (breakfast was nice) but I think we could have better support during that awful night and not listen from her that ""tear gas is good for the skin"" and that ""other guest did not complain"" (a couple left early in the morning and we say saw only a group of for the next day). What I am saying is that we deserve more transparency when asked about any unsafe situation and comprehension and respect when problems happens. Unlucky only?! PS. We moved to Sultahmet hotel district and it was so peaceful.","July 7, 2013","9    Dila Suites

522,"My husband and I spent four nights in the Junior Suite; our adult daughter joined us there for the last night. We loved our clean, comfortable room; it is beautiful and thoughtfully appointed. Even when the couch was unfolded into a double bed, there was ample space for three. There was virtually no street noise with the windows closed, and the air conditioner is both effective and quiet. Breakfast on the terrace was wonderful. The view and ambiance were great. Deniz provided an abundant and delicious spread, with some special and different additions each morning. We really enjoyed talking with Deniz and Ali, who were very gracious and willing to share opinions and insights about this fascinating city. It was the perfect way to start the day. The location is ideal, in a lively and fun area, convenient to restaurants and public transportation. It is also easy to reach other parts of the city, by walking (as we often did) or catching a bus. It is also close enough to Taksim Square to take advantage of the transportation hub there, but far enough away that we did not see or hear any sign of the protests that were erupting on our last day.","June 22, 2013","9    Dila Suites

I can honestly and confidently say that I regret not staying in this hotel during my previous visits to Istanbul although I had amazing stays at some of those hotels. We fell in love with this hotel for the following reasons. Excellent value for money, great amenities and the friendliest bunch of people at your beck and call. Dila Suites is situated a few minutes from Taksim Square and Istiklal Street, both major attractions that you cannot miss when you visit Istanbul. The owners of the hotel, Mr. Ali and his wonderful wife, were so nice, polite and extremely helpful and the cups of tea they offer are tremendous. Home made breakfast that we enjoyed at the sunny terrace was just what needed to start our mornings. In short, comfort, convenience, value and service are phenomenal. Beautifully renovated building. Smart, spacious and stylish rooms. In short, we will be back again and again and again as the hotel exceeded our expectations. Thanks Dila Suites!","May 31, 2013","9    Dila Suites

Where to begin..........the property is outstanding, beautiful, comfortable, impeccably clean and very spacious. The location is excellent, close to everything, only steps to restaurants, shopping, transit, etc., you simply could not ask for a better location. The daily breakfast was fabulous and was a great time to sit and exchange stories of our adventures with other guests. It was a very intimate setting which we very much enjoyed. The big plus was the rooftop patio which offered an idyllic view of Istanbul at a wonderful vantage point.The most AMAZING part for us was both Deniz and Ali, the owners of Dila Suites. We have NEVER come across more gracious, kind and warm people. No matter what we needed they went out of their way to accommodate us.

The owners have been charming, friendly and provided all the necessities for a cosy stay at their suites. Choosing the Dila Suites has meant staying at a perfect location in Istanbul, because of the proximity to places like Istiklal Caddesi street or other places in the center, where it is easy to visit many of the key attractions. Imagine a breakfast on a terrace that overlooks the center, with a perfect cup of coffee or tea and the irresistible Turkish sweets and delights.

534,"Bosphorus palace review for trip advisorI stayed 7 nights from the end of June to the first few days in July 2016. Service is spectacular. Everyone had a great command of the English language and that great Turkish hospitality in their blood. I felt like I stayed with family. Very polite, friendly, helpful. They even arranged for private sea taxi to get me back and forth to the Europen side and back to Atarurk Airport so I wouldn't have to sit in traffic. Room 24 was huge, high ceilings, well-decorated in the old style and just so lovely and elegant. Beautiful Jacuzzi in spacious marble bath. The view is spectacular. The Bosphorus lapping up sometimes close to my window from the wake of a boat to the panorama of this sprawling city at either first light, during the day or at sunset. Incredible. The sea view from this hotel is beyond what anyone could expect after staying in hi-rise hotels here. I was one flight over the Bosphorus and kept the windows open and the air conditioning off my entire stay. There was quite a constant breeze which even left me cold at night. The end of June. Imagine that!If you're a smoker, you can go through the restaurant where the boats used to pull up and under the mansion in the old days and sit on the wall and watch the fish swim by. Or get blown away by the breathtaking view of all of Istanbul including both bridges. It's very peaceful here away from the hustle and bustle. The little village of Beylerbeyi can be explored on foot and also the Beylerbeyi Palace down the road. Now I see why the Royals built their Summer Palace here: the weather is delightful and not at all like the sweltering city. I had some incredible meals by the ferry stop and great shopping too. everyone is very friendly, polite and helpful. A smile goes a long way. I recommend asking them to arrange for flat fee private car transfer from airport. Watching the meter tick when sitting in afternoon rush hour traffic would have started me out on the wrong foot. Well worth it and also not getting ""The Royal Tour of Istanbul"" when the yellow taxi driver finds out you're not a local. I used to live here in Istanbul so I know most of the tricks to have a smooth, effortless, enjoyable visit. I will definitely stay here again when I return in September. If you have any questions concerning your visit I will offer you the hospitality that has been given to me to the best of my ability. ","February 28, 2017","10    Bosphorus Palace Hotel

Hygiene & Cleanliness is Superb.Friendliness if staff is way above expectations, you feel at home and they are family members. They are very generous with the Amenities they give. They bring a new pair of slippers DAILY, the soap, shampoo & hair conditioners are top quality that you'd love to use. The breakfast is very generous and with great flavor.The rooms are spacious, the hotel and rooms are very well maintained, the View is Spectacular and cannot have a better view from the Location of the hotel on the bosphorus & the hotel is right on the water. If you jump you are right on the water.Each room has big windows, so wherever you are in the room you can have an awesome view. Even if you are laying in bed you can see the view without having to lift your head up.It happened on the first day of our arrival, a Coup happens in Istanbul and we got worried and wanted to get out to the ATM Machine to get some Cash. Of course there was an obliged curfew in all istanbul by the Government, so the hotel closed it's big outside gate and said nicely we are not allowed to get out for our own safety. When we told them we need to draw money from the ATM outside, they told us not to worry about anything. They said we have money and we will give you whatever you need, you don't have to pay us here anything. Later after you go to your own countries you can send us money. They told us they have food and drink and to ask for whatever we want and they'll serve us.At one point there was shooting on the bridge next to the hotel, the receptionist came & told us they'd prefer to change our room with a higher floor one far from the side of the shooting. Of course we did. They also closed our curtains & asked us to lower the lighting & to stay away from the windows. Then they kept checking on us if we needed any food or drink.We never felt as safe and comfortable before, we felt we were secured and being taken care of by caring family members. They were giving from their hearts.The reception people, the waiters and security people were just GREAT.Thumbs up to the lovely people & GOD BLESS YOU & YOUR LOVELY COUNTRY.

541,"I can't tell you what an amazing stay and experience I had at Bosphorus Palace. I had read some of the reviews on TripAdvisor and so was a bit ambiguous about what to expect however after arriving past midnight into this stately waterfront mansion, I was taken to my corner bedroom and speechless with the view! The bedroom is very large, with an equally grand bathroom, big wardrobes, dressing table and coffee stand and chairs. The bedroom literally sits on the water, so when you open the window you look directly at the Bosphorus which lines the hotel. I left the windows open during the night, falling asleep staring out at the water and the beautiful city skyline, with a soundtrack of the soft lapping of waves on the water below. I didn't want to leave my room...The staff are all incredibly helpful and friendly, with plenty of advice and recommendations on what to do. It's not a ""modern"" hotel in the sense like a Hilton or a Hyatt, but it's the former home of a Pasha and has been preserved as such, so best to keep in mind when thinking about amenities (e.g. no swimming pool/recreational activities). I would recommend this hotel for those that want to be on the waterfront, in a relatively quieter location, and who have been to Istanbul previously or are somewhat familiar with the city - as it's located on the Asian side (an 8 minute taxi ride to the transport hub of Uskudar with connections to Sultan Ahmet / Taksim etc...). So you'll need to know you're bearings or be happy with a little travel if you want to see the rest of the city.I can't wait to come back here soon!","October 17, 2015","10    Bosphorus Palace Hotel

But it's hopeless if you are staying and someone else is getting married.We stayed two nights and there were weddings on both nights. Quite understandably, the wedding guests were having a lovely time, dancing in the gardens. Meanwhile, we were trapped inside, windows shut against the thumping music, with no restaurant service, no bar and security guards ushering us away. It was miserable. Even in the morning, we were treated like second-class citizens. It took an hour to be served breakfast, despite there being no one else in the dining room. And frankly, it wasn't worth waiting for. We weren't even offered a cold drink (even water) or a choice of tea of coffee. Tea was served; when we asked for coffee we were served instant coffee.

546,"We stayed here for one Saturday night as the last day in our trip to Turkey. We had splurged a little more than we normally would on this as a luxury hotel and were deeply disappointed. This hotel was by a long shot the worst thing about our entire trip. When we arrived at about 6pm on Saturday evening, there was a wedding reception happening in the courtyard which was the only way into the hotel. We had to walk right through the wedding photographs to get into the lobby and register. As we were wearing our usual casual travel gear, we felt very uncomfortable and extremely guilty about possibly upsetting the wedding party. Although there was staff outside the courtyard, no one from the hotel walked us through the party (where we had to weave among tables) or otherwise ushered us in which might have at least given us some legitimacy as guests at the reception were clearly wondering who we were and what we were doing there.Once we finally got into the lobby and registered, we were led to a room on the first floor facing the reception. Our window was at eye level with people sitting at the tables in the reception, and the lights set up outside pointed straight into the room, not to mention the noise level of a wedding party 3 feet outside our window. Although my husband and I are very laid back travelers and have never before asked for a room change, we did demand a different room here since we could basically not use the room we were given. They did switch our room - to the one directly above it. Although this was slightly better as we were not looking out at eye level, the noise remained problematic. We were spending the evening out with friends though, and running late, so we decided to stay and just hope that the wedding would be over when we returned. Of course, when we left, we had to again go through the wedding party, weaving among tables to get to the exit of the courtyard, with all of the same awkwardness and no assistance from the hotel staff. While we would normally have come back somewhat early on our last night of a trip, we delayed going back until midnight, so the music had stopped, but of course the bridal party was still there and the staff then began cleaning up plates, tables, utensils, and other things, so the noise continued past 1am.Because of these issues, we were completely unable to enjoy anything the hotel had to offer. We were not comfortable going to the hotel bar (which was effectively part of the reception) or staying in the hotel at all after our arrival. We weren't even really comfortable being in our room until the bridal party had left since it really felt like we were intruding on their wedding. At no time did the hotel staff really apologize for our inconvenience or offer anything in the way of compensation.Our room itself, while very pretty on the surface, had no air conditioning (there was a switch but it did not work) and the fan was so painfully loud that we had to turn it off. We also found that the scrubbing pad provided in the bathroom had clearly been used before. Finally, we were hoping that breakfast would be a saving grace - in our 8 days in Turkey, every other breakfast we had was wonderful. Not so here. The breakfast had no yogurt, no fruit in honey, not even any bowls available for cereal. There was no tea immediately available, and although the staff brought some tea to the table next to ours that clearly had wedding guests, we had to ask for tea two times and both times were treated as if this was an unreasonable request.As a final indignity, when we left the hotel, we had planned to walk up to the street to get a cab, but they offered to call a cab for us, so we said ok. When the cab arrived at the front door, the meter was already running and at up to 7.5 lira. In a hotel where everything else had been up to par, we would have overlooked this, but here it just seemed one last way that the hotel was being inconsiderate.It is a pretty-looking hotel with nice views of the Bosphorus and rooms that could be gorgeous, but there seemed to be something systemically wrong in the staffing. It was the worst - by a very long way - that we were treated by anyone in Turkey, and particularly by anyone actually working in the service industry.","July 20, 2014","10    Bosphorus Palace Hotel

Their generosity and hospitality is unmatched, more than once , whenever we got guests , they served us all Complimentary Turkish coffee & tea in lobby ! Outside everything is few steps away. i highly recommend the restaurants in the neighbourhood, especially Tikke. Just outside the hotel , buy an Istanbul card & use the public transport. It was my first time ever to use Turkish public transport, although i spoke no Turkish, we managed very well. avoiding all traffic by going on boat to the western side. it costs a tiny fraction of 7 liras for all round trip including metro ( underground train ) buses, etc vs 50 in a taxi each direction .( A word of warning, never give taxi big money note. i gave one 100 liras, and he pretended he got only 20 , and took off. !! ) generally taxis with company names are ok. dont take ones with no name even if its yellow.It takes 3 minutes to cross from east to west by the under ground. or beautiful scenic trip by boat 15 minutes. We spent Seven days at Bosphorus Palace hotel , accompanied by my parents in next room, we felt very special as if we were the only guests in the hotel although it was full. Sadek , took care of all our needs, he even tried fixing my phone charger to get a bit of charge. Pelin even translated a Turkish food recipe for me. The noon call for prayer is hardly heard, we were amused about the reviewer who ""flipped"" when he heard it ...! The morning one is the only one that woke me up the first day, but went to sleep in a minute. I highly recommend this place, pay the extra bit and get sea view, it's worth it. And you will discover a new home in Turkey full of family and friends . ","December 14, 2013","10    Bosphorus Palace Hotel

But if you would like to sleep overnight think twice because a mosque is right the next building and you will be astonished how modern technologies have improved the level of sound at every sunset, sunrise and couple of other times during a day. My room was at the roof with a small balcon to the mosque. I dropped a soap when imam started to pray so loud and sudden it was. At the reception I was told that this level of sound is everywhere in the building.Furthermore there was some movie shooting till 2 am, so I was really unlucky that night.On the positive side - nice and tasty breakfast, good comfort in the rooms and quick trip to the city.","May 28, 2013","10    Bosphorus Palace Hotel

553,"This hotel is a house that has witnessed the final period of the Ottoman Empire and the first 50 years of Turkey as a private house (Mansion of Debreli Ismail Pasha) before the Ministry of Tourism decided to renovate it. It was one of the finest examples of the Neo-Ottoman architecture. After a big fire that destroyed the house to a great extent, it was rebuilt and looks better than ever (I know how it looked like around 1960 after the economic decline of the owners). The house is located in Beylerbeyi where a group of yalıs (mansions built at and over the water) with the best reputation because of their vast and beautiful gardens. Since the houses were built not just at the Bosphorus but parts of them over the water, and the windows starts just over the floor, the view over the sea is really great. On the left, it reaches till the old center of Constantinople and the harbor, on the right one can view the last bay where Jason was to be seen before reaching the Black Sea to get the Golden Fleece. In former times, the kids of the owners used to jump into water from their bedrooms. The boathouse, a unique feature of such buildings, built under the house allowing to enter the building from your boat, has been converted into a restaurant. Great idea to take breakfast with waves that almost reach your table. Looking right ahead, you see one of the finest hotels in the world, a former palace, just to the left from the window people fishing mackerels. Next boat stop is just 100 m, the bridge over the Bosphorus to Europe around 1000 m. Bus or taxi is just 50 m away. If you order a water taxi, you avoid encounters with the chaotic traffic of Istanbul. Water busses are extremely cheap and can take you from here to the end of the Golden Horn on the one end and almost to the Black Sea on the other. Beylerbeyi is part of the ancient town Chrysopolis, the Golden City, and has played a magnificent role in Christian history: When Constantine the Great decided to adopt Christian belief as the state religion of Rome, he ordered to erect a big cross here to symbolize the fact that the Roman Empire was now a Christian country. At this place, no longer than 300 m to walk, there is a big palace (Beylerbeyi Palace) with its gardens called “Istavroz Gardens” called after the Greek name of the Christian cross. If you wish to stay in this hotel, ask for a room not facing the mosque (on the southwest side) unless you wish to wake up early.","March 22, 2013","10    Bosphorus Palace Hotel

558,"If you look at the lovely pic of the front of the hotel you can't fail to be impressed by the entrance, wide marble courtyard and sweeping steps up to the front door. The promise of excellent service and sumptuous rooms filled with antique furniture. This was going to be a wonderful start to our 25th anniversary trip.WRONG! When we arrived the entire front courtyard was taken over by a wedding ceremony, there was no room service and we were asked to advise the front desk if we wanted to leave as the front entrance was out of bounds and we would have to be escorted out via the service door. The room itself was quite large, but the bathroom was desperately in need of a refit with mouldy sealant around the bath, the whirl pool sockets were broken and didn't work and the toothbrush holder had been broken and badly glued. The sink hadn't been cleaned and still had toothpaste spits in it. The soap tray was caked in the previous persons soap.The ""antiques"" were cheap reproductions, and the room was too dark as it only had 2 small lamps and no ceiling light. There were hardly any sockets, and only 2 clothes hangers in the closet. I called down for more and was told I'd have to wait until some guests checked out the following morning and they could be taken from other rooms.There were 3 rooms overlooking the Bosphorus on our level and ours was on the right hand side, I noticed that it was possible to look directly into the room next door (the middle room) from our room, I realised this because I caught the person in that room staring into mine - he was a friendly chap as he even waved at me! Goodness knows how long he'd been there before I spotted him.The first night we had to suffer constant noise from wedding guests running up and down the hall, but thought ""oh well, we've still got another night""Hmmmmm, guess what, there was a wedding the second night too! Unbelievable. Again we were unable to exit via the front and had to literally pick our way through the guests in the middle of the wedding ceremony. It was grossly unfair on everyone, us, the bride and groom and of course their guests who regarded us with open hostility. Again no room service. There was no drink making facility, or mini bar.Breakfast was served on the lower level, it was a small room with low, oppressive ceilings. We were served by a waiter who didn't speak either English, French or German. So in the end we just used gestures. There was no choice, just a small plate with some bland cheese, a few slices of meat with curly edges and some olives. The second morning we asked for breakfast in our room but were told they were too busy clearing up after the wedding.We were supposed to stay and third night but found that, yes you guessed it, there was due to be another private party that night! Enough was enough, we were paying 390eu/ night for a very stress filled stay so we voted with our feet and moved to the Four Seasons - absolutely luxury in comparison and for slightly less per night.","October 2, 2012","10    Bosphorus Palace Hotel

Ticket can be easily purchased on the spot, just have Tusrkish Lira with you.It is better to skip the rate which include breakfast, as to me the breakfast was boring while you can explore lots of options from nearby cafes or restaurant which some of them are open since morning.For moslem traveller, the hotel is next to a historical mosque which is still actively used.","June 2, 2012","10    Bosphorus Palace Hotel

You can’t beat its location, which is in the heart of Old Istanbul, walking distance to many major landmarks and incredible views from their full-service, rooftop patio. The desk staff are friendly, knowledgeable and extremely accommodating. Housekeeping went above and beyond and the included breakfast was extensive, compared to most European hotels we’ve stayed at. Istanbul is an incredible city and Amira made our visit here all that much more special! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!! ","July 13, 2019","12    Hotel Amira Istanbul

The hotel is very comfortable, well located for the most famous historical sites, with very good breakfasts and a delightful roof terrace. But what really sets it apart are the staff: without exception friendly, full of excellent advice, alwayts smiling. They clearly take great pride in the service they offer. We became quite friendly with a number of them in just 4 days. If you want a nice friendly 'retreat' from the bustle of Istanbul, I can't recommend Hotel Amira highly enough.

589,"Staying at boutique hotels can be amazing or a disappointment. This was definitely AMAZING.The staff make you feel at home from the minute you step into the hotel. There was not a single person who was not friendly and helpful, and always smiling. Excellent quality and variety of the choices at breakfast. Again very friendly staff. We tried the traditional stuffed bread breakfast that is made fresh for you, by a nice old lady.The rooms are very clean, updated, and with a strong air conditioning unit. The room was diligently cleaned daily. Fresh towels left after every clean.The front desk staff go beyond what you would expect to help you have a good experience in Istanbul. Answer any question....advise/guide you how to get the best of the area you want to visit. Their recommendations of local restaurants were very helpful and did not disappoint. That's a very important point in any large tourist oriented city. You will find a restaurant/cafe on every street.........most are very low quality.On our first night we ate at a terrace restaurant they recommended about 10mins walk away. Excellent food, service and ambiance. Was a great way to start our 4 days in Istanbul.Hotel is very convenient to all the historic sites..........my wife and mostly walked every where. We took the tram (easy to use) one day to get to the spice market area.We would definitely stay at Amira again on our next trip. So much more to see in Istanbul.","July 6, 2019","12    Hotel Amira Istanbul

590,"We first entered Amira wondering how a small boutique hotel as such would carry the title of the 14th best hotel in the world.However, after a night stay and a chance to meet with the staff team, we were already deeply impressed by what this little but elegant hotel can offer. To name a few: Upon check in, we were greeted at the reception by AJ (Robert Downey Jr lookalike) who quickly briefed us on the city of Istanbul and places to see and dine at with great enthusiasm. Throughout our 6 nights here at Amira, he was always helpful and humorous, adding to the livelihood of the hotel. Sam (bellboy) always greeted us and attended to our requests efficiently with a big smile. Ugur (Terrace/restaurant staff) was also very bright and we shared a great conversation. Ufuk (Operational Manager) kindly helped us with a minor bathroom problem personally with close follow-up, including arrangements for our tours and transport schedules. Overall, Hotel Amira wouldn’t be the same without its amazing team and we highly recommend this hotel alongside its very convenient location, terrace bar with a view, cozy breakfast area, comfy bedding , and all the little details that provided us a very pleasant stay.","July 1, 2019","12    Hotel Amira Istanbul

592,"Amidst Istanbul’s cobblestone strewn alleys and walkways you'll find quaint boutique hotels galore. Tucked away behind its nondescript facade beckons a hidden gem aptly named Hotel Amira that oozes whimsy and bohemian savior-faire.Unpretentious and charismatic as she is, the princess draws you in and never lets you go.Amira straddles old-world charm and 21st century conveniences with as much aplomb as the Bosporus Bridge does Europe and Asia.Undoubtedly, her true charm is her staff that navigates the slippery slope of doting patronage and benign insouciance. Think butler with a sense of humor. Supersized.Truth be told, we had to pry ourselves loose from her embrace just so we could catch our balloon in Cappadocia.

597,"We only had 1 night in Istanbul during an extended layover and this hotel was the perfect choice. Its location is fantastic, a safe neighborhood right within the larger Sultanahmet area, walking distance to pretty much all the major sights in the Old Town. If you take the Havaist airport shuttle bus that stops at Sultanahmet, you are about a 10 minute downhill walk to the hotel. Upon hearing how little time we had in the city, we were given recommendations on what to do. The dinner cruise on the Bosphorus was great, although I would not recommend you attempt it if you are jet lagged as it was about 1am before we reached the hotel. We also joined the walking tour the next day and that was an easy way to quickly take in the major sights. Breakfast spread was excellent and we got to sample so many Turkish foods. However, the best thing about the Amira is the high standard of service. They have a great sense of humor and put you at ease very quickly. They actually knew my name even before I checked in, just as we were arriving. Now THAT impressed my husband. Nothing is too much trouble, and you can tell the staff are well trained.

They would even make suggestions on ways to enhance my trip that I wouldn’t have even thought of. Examples include:When I arrived they already knew who I was and after taking a picture of my passport all employees knew my name and room number immediately (zero learning curve). The concierge service was hugely necessary for me as my trip was rather last minute so I didn’t have a chance to plan out what I wanted to do, but the staff was more than happy to help me arrange literally every hour of my trip. I was traveling alone and the staff was more than happy to keep me company for a tea before bed on the roof top. The staff was impeccable with giving directions and had some high tech maps to help show me my way. They also made themselves available via text for on the spot suggestions while I was out of the hotel, a service I really appreciated when looking for a place to eat. On my last evening the staff asked me what time my flight was the following day and suggested the hour I should leave for the airport, offered a wake up call, helped me to arrange for a safe, reliable and affordable ride to the airport.

620,"Our first stay at Amira hotel while exploring Istanbul and definitely not the last! Hotel is located in a walking distance (5-10 min) to major historical attractions (Sultanahmet, Aya Sofiya, Hippodrome, Basilica) in a quiet neighborhood. The rooms are spacious and clean (we stayed in a suite with 2 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms) for 3 adults and 2 small kids. The front desk staff was very welcoming and helpful with any questions we had. Breakfast was amazing! One of the best we had in Istanbul (and we tried many to say the least): catering to a variety of tastes: cold salads, warm salads, cold cuts, variety of cheeses, fruits, breads, honeycomb, and many other delicacies. This hearty breakfast was enough for us for the whole day of sightseeing until dinner time. Lots of restaurants nearby as well as Arasta bazaar few mins away. Great location, welcoming staff, clean and spacious rooms, and breakfast to die for. Recommend to all my friends. Can't wait to go back!","May 11, 2019","12    Hotel Amira Istanbul

624,"This is a small/boutique hotel which is absolutely made by its staff and it is situated within a very short walk of many of the main sites of Istanbul (Blue Mosque, Hajia Sophia and Basilica Cistern). All the staff were so accommodating and friendly, and were very quick to recommend tours/sites/restaurants for us, which were booked and arranged very easily, all of which were very reasonable too, we did not feel we overpaid for anything they suggested. The staff are really what makes this hotel so special, they clearly enjoy their work and go out of their way to make your stay enjoyable and special. In the busy world we live in today, there are not many places in the hospitality industry that achieve the level of service that this hotel does, I cannot praise them highly enough for it.The breakfast was served in the dining room and there was plenty of choice available, with cereals, fruits, breads and pastries as well as freshly made turkish breads.Our room was lovely, very large and with a balcony that we could sit out on, looking out onto the sea and listening to the hubbub of life carrrying on below. As well as a decent mirror, there was a hairdryer and even hair straighteners! It was very clean, my only tiny, little negative was that the carpet in the room was a little tired, but this was such a minor point on what was otherwise a very, very enjoyable stay.","May 1, 2019","12    Hotel Amira Istanbul

The staff were able to recommend restaurants and make bookings for us.The dining room was nice with an reasonable breakfast including lovely freshly made golzemes.We ate dinner in the restaurant a couple of nights. Its not really set up as a restaurant at night but was an easy place for us to have a simple meal and drink when I was not feeling too good and we couldn't be bothered venturing out.Our room was lovely. Up a lift then some stairs but that was no problem. We had a huge room with little sitting room and a little balcony which overlooked the sea - this was a perfect stop for a coffee in the morning.","April 27, 2019","12    Hotel Amira Istanbul

627,"Objectively: Excellent location, great facilities, and superb staff.Subjectively: This hotel has the best customer service I have experienced (and I can fairly say I have stayed at a good many hotels through my travels and even had Jumeirah Group as a client and experienced all of their properties across Dubai). I could write a long essay on the numerous ways the staff displayed exceptional hospitality towards myself and my family but I'll sum up with the following examples: - upon arrival (A.J.) spent over an hour with us teaching us the ins-and-outs of Istanbul. - not a single question, request, or adjustment we requested went un-answered, and all to our complete satisfaction. - morning breakfast buffet is lovely and the fresh made Gozleme is a nice treat - the main attractions (Sultanahmet (Blue) Mosque, Hagia Sophia, Topkapi Palace) are literally less than 10 minutes away walking (which I think is perfect) - value for the price paid I think is simply the bestThere were a small number of things that needed attention which I brought to their attention upon my checking out; they were cosmetic for the most part and I would be shocked if they didn't address them after being informed about them. I wholeheartedly recommend this hotel and personally I will make this my first choice if and when I return to Istanbul. My sincere thanks to ALL the staff for all their assistance (especially helping my father with his search for a watch), the numerous pots of tea through the evenings, and the long list of recommendations which were all worth it.","April 21, 2019","12    Hotel Amira Istanbul

So ideally located.Very clean room, nice comfy beds. Terrific breakfast included with very nice spread. Please visit the Teyze (auntie) right next door for some gozleme (like a turkish morning quesadilla) she hand makes the dough.They accommodate any requests, make reservations, suggestions. etc. Just a wonderful staff that speaks fluent English too.What stands out is the service of this hotel, the nicest, most sincere staff I've ever met. Karin, Harun, Volkan, and especially Adam/Adem helping us out will never forget them.Room has fridge, safe, A/c and heater. Basement there is a gym stocked with water bottles and towels.

631,"We stayed at the Amira for one leg of our honeymoon. The other 3 stops were all 5star hotels across Europe and Africa but this was the best. We had the most wonderful stay thanks to the staff who were beyond exceptional. They’re enterprising and personal manner makes them anticipate your needs and rush to help you out. The room we stayed in was wonderfully unique and perfectly set up for a woman (dressing table and hair dryer and straighteners) which is not something we frequently get. They welcome every person with a sit down discussion of Istanbul with insights that are extremely helpful and tips on where to go and what to see. This comes with a complimentary drink for everyone. The hotel is perfectly located in the old district so a stones throw from Haggia Sophia, the Hoppodrome and Blue mosque. All other attractions are within a short walking distance. Again, I can’t say how much the staff at this small but well thought out hotel made it. We can’t wait to go back for our anniversary and see the soon to be completed terrace bar.

I was welcomed, my room was cleaned, I could pay by euros and liras. They even to change my money. The room was clean and everything was so easy explained and done.The place is close to anything. You just go down for the trams and everything is nearby. Karakoy is defenitly the place for hip places so you can also check out the area for one day. Taksim is just at walking distance.I tried both type of accomodations. The dorn and the suits. The dorn is steady, do not forget to bring a towel and lock for your personal belongings. Everything is taken care of. There are charging points next to everybody bed and a light to read a book. Lockers are put central in the room.The suite is a bit more expensive, but that is nothing compared to what you get. A two person bed room, a private balcony and bathroom. Lounge area in the room. There were however no soaps, or any other stuff. They have a hairdryer and soap to clean your hands. Awesome place and awesome stuff. ","August 24, 2016","13    Downtown Istanbul

643,"I would have given it 5 stars but the location is kind of hard to find for the first time. It has pros and cons... it is nestled in some narrow back streets but that also means it's very quiet. The only problem I had at all was carrying my bags from the airport. I took the metro over but their directions to the place are not clear at all. For future people if you go to or get dropped off at Galata Tower and you are very close although through some windy streets. Other than my initial frustration finding the place, overall it was a very pleasant stay. And if you give cab drivers the address on the website they will look at you funny and go 'I don't know that place'. Maybe on the website they should do some photos that show you directions from landmarks where to turn along with a bigger map. The area where the place is is just steps away from a very lively part of Itstiklal Road which is a major attraction of Istanbul. The south end there has tons of music shops and historically has been known as a bit more of a 'shady' area but to me I found it clean, nice, and very safe.

Nothing to do much with the hostel itself in this point though.Wifi was terrible. I thought it was because of the blocking during the bomb or something that was why I cannot connect or surf any site at all. I realized it was not after I tried connecting in some cafes and restaurants and it worked well.- Across the street from Old Java cafe which is the great one.- Check in process was great.Tip:- To the hostel from the airport, I would say the best way is taking the tram ( blue line) from Zeytinburnu Metro station and get off at Kakoy or Tophane station. Less walking and less transfer. Once arrive at the airport ,go downstairs as directed to the metro station and buy one Istanbul cart with-20 TL bank note.Take the metro until reach Zeytinburnu-6th stop and on the right side will be the tram stop.Cross the tram way to the middle or another side and look for the line to Kabatas. Not likely to have a chance to sit but it is a great opportunity to see the town. After 30 min and cross the bridge, get off at Kakoy station then walk down to the underground pah, follow the sign Galata tower which you gotta take left.Once up to the ground,walk straight ahead alone the main street about 100 meters, Hotel Gradiva will be on the left..If you arrive during the night like me so do not take this alley yet because it is pretty dark, walk straight a bit more and then turn left to that steep streat ' Yuksek Kaldirim' which full of shops. Walk up and up, I would say it will give you sweat! until you reach the Galata tower intersection. Then Gala tower will be on the left side, take dark street on the right side which there is LED shop.Once walk pass the LED shop, turn left into the small alley.You will see the sign of Galata kitchen. The hotel is on the same side of this restaurant,walk farther about 200 m and keeps looking on this side because the sign of the hotel is very small.The hostel is across the street from Old Java cafe.- PTT yellow post box was nearby. It is located at the Galata tower and it just looked like a trash bin. I hope it works. Stamps can be brought at the grocery shop near this postal box.","October 15, 2015","13    Downtown Istanbul

666,"This new hostel is great for those looking access to a kitchen. The hostel is essentially built of 4 apartments, with each apartment having one shared bathroom, one kitchen, one dorm room ( beds) and 3 private rooms. We stayed in a dorm room - the negative was that the curtains were not great and there was a lot of light in the room.The location is good, it takes about 5 minutes to walk to Istiklal Caddesi, one of the main streets in Istanbul. Lots of restaurent and nightlife options in the surroundings. However, the 5 min walk takes you under the highway and the hostel itself is in quite a small street - as we were a group of 4, we were ok walking home at night together, but I'm not sure I would have felt safe by myself - note to solo (female) travelers. The kitchen is basic, but equipped with a few pots and pans, as well as some cutlery ect. It would be nice if the hostel provided the basics such as salt, pepper and olive oil.","September 22, 2014","13    Downtown Istanbul

It is in a good location though, as once I found it, it was easy to go to the places I wanted to go. It's in an.' up and coming' neighborhood, but the building itself was nice, clean, and run more like rooms in an apartment than a hostel. This offered some good and bad I guess. The bad was that there wasn't really a mingling place for the entire hostel, the good was that there was a mingling place for the people specifically in your flat. I had some great conversations with the other people sharing the apartment with me as well. Another great point about this was the manager, Kaan, was really nice and helpful. One night, he even brought me along with him and some other people to a restaurant for an evening. It was nice to be included :)All in all, I think it was a great value for the money, very clean (which is probably my most important criteria), and in a good location to walk around Istiklal as well as going down towards the Sultanahmet side.","July 24, 2014","13    Downtown Istanbul

The room was clean and spacious, with A/C, bright and with a view over the near houses.We spent very pleasant and relaxing time on the terrace on top of the hotel also. The staff was quite extraordinary. Our hotel manager, Vural anticipated almost all our needs and helped us with hints about our visits, transport, walks or recommendations about the restaurants in the area. One evening, at Vural’s request, a staff member accompanied us till the entrance of one of the restaurants in the area, which Vural recommended us. We were so happy with all the recommendations.We found the location of the hotel close to almost everything we needed. Easy to access by bus or by foot if you’re not getting tired after few walking steps.Overall : quality services at a very good price.

Staying at this hotel also gave us inexpensive eating options: a chicken kebab dinner with bulgur and tomatoes, freshly cooked in a kiln in the friendly hole-in-the-wall down the street, cost about $4, compared to $10 or more in Sultanahmet. It was a fantastic place to relax and remove ourselves from the hustle and bustle of the more touristy areas of Istanbul. The hotel is also close to one of Istanbul's great wonders, the Chora Church.

The room and bed was very comfortable and clean, shower had great water pressure, the AC/heater functioned perfectly, the wifi signal was strong and fast, and the satellite TV and mini fridge was a nice touch. The complimentary breakfast each morning was fresh and wonderful, and you are provided with unlimited coffee and tea 24/7. The location is safe and conveniently located to major attractions and transportation options without being right in the middle of the busy touristy areas, which means you will have a quiet night's rest. Plenty of inexpensive dining options located adjacent to the hotel, in addition to some mini-markets if you want to buy groceries or snacks. Literally right next door is a safe place you can exchange USD to Turkish Lira for better rates than I've seen at the major areas in the center. There is always somebody at the main lobby/diner at the entrance than can assist you at any time of day or night. The hotel is about 4 stories high and there is no elevator, only stairs, but we should all do a bit more exercise anyway. :-) The rooftop terrace has a nice view of the area and some tables where you can have your morning coffee or cigarette if you smoke.Ahmet is the owner (see my picture with him below) and he speaks pretty much perfect English and will spend a good deal of time sitting with you and giving you a detailed map of Istanbul and what to visit and how to get there.

I had a very pleasant week at the Lotus. All the staff were very friendly. In particular Ahmet who was very helpful. I arrived late the first day and he wasn't there but on the first morning he sat me down and explained all the places of interest to visit. He has a good sense of humor! The rooms are basic which I expected for the price but, having said that, my room had a safe, air conditioning, fridge and kettle etc. for making a cuppa :-) The most important thing for me was that the room was clean. Actually, the shower was lovely, very strong and very hot!The location was interesting because you're actually in a zone with locals. For that it's quite good. For example, a pomegranite juice there costs 1 TL but down in the tourist zone it's 5 TL. I don't speak Turkish so food was interesting. I did want to explore though and try things that I never tried before so I just pointed and that was that :-) Ahmet also explained how it's easy to get a bus back and forth. I didn't use it but one day when I was waiting for a tourist bus I saw many many of the buses he told me to get going past so it's well served. I prefer to walk and was walking between 12km and 20km every day. From my own point of view I would recommend the Lotus hotel and I would stay there again but it may not be for everybody but hopefully my review above will help to decide. Oh and I chose a double room to myself rather than sharing. One thing more I've just remembered, the breakfast is great.","December 8, 2015","14    Lotus Hotel Istanbul

688,"My wife and I have just finished 2 months travelling throughtout Southern Europe where we stayed in a total of 19 hotels. I booked the Lotus Hotel before we left on our trip after reading a trip advisor review saying it was cheaper to book direct. I emailed the hotel and sure enough the price quoted was cheaper than any of the major travel websites. With our 3 night booking we got a free airport transfer to the hotel which was a huge plus. We extended our stay another 2 nights and negotiated an even better rate.To cut a long story short our stay at the hotel was great. It was made so much better by the fantastic generosity and kindness of the owner and staff. I will never forget the help offered me when a package I had sent tothe hotel went astray. The assistance given was truly above and beyond all expectations. We also loved the ""local"" vibe of the neighborhood. To me I'd rather eat with the locals even if communication involves a lot of getures and guessing. I much prefer that than eating with the tourists at tourist prices.We got an Istanbulcart bus pass which can be bought and recharged near the hotel so the 15 minute bus trip to Eminonu ( to get to all the famous sites) and back was a breeze. We walked the trip the first time which was well worth it as the shops on the way are very interesting.  The rooms and facilities in the hotel are standard however the staff and location I feel maken this an exceptional place to stay in Istanbul.

695,"Hands down the most hospitable hotel I have ever stayed in. Vural was very welcoming and friendly, and made us feel very comfortable. Our first night we were asked if we could be put in a small room at the top of the hotel as one of the booking companies had an error and had asked if the hotel could accommodate unexpected guests. We were only staying one night before going on a short tour so we were fine with this. We also received the room heavily discounted and management were extremely apologetic. While small, the room was comfortable and made me think of what it might have been like in 'constantinople'... it felt authentic. After our tour we stayed one more night in a 4 person room, very comfortable and clean.The breakfasts were more than either my partner or I could finish and tasty. Airport transfers were cheap and reliable through the hotel and we were given a map with very clear directions and recommendations from Vural.WiFi was reliable. Small supermarket just doors down. 20 minute brisk walk to the bazaars along picturesque waterfront. Highly recommended! ","July 3, 2015","14    Lotus Hotel Istanbul

Although the place is a bit far off, there is plenty of food option which are very cheap. The best part of this particular hotel is the hospitality.

Beadsheets and towels are changed daily. Drinking water anytime available. Everything is in working condition. Wifi signal is vwry strong.

He stayed in Sultan Ahmed area so need to fetch him there.Even my friend is surprised on how cheap transportation that Vural arranged.Will definitely recommend anyone who just need a cheap and clean place to stay.

First day Vural ( owner) gave us a map to the city and told us places we can eat and travel to, so that was an excellent introduction to the city, he also recommended us government restaurant (fresh food, great service and very decent price) 3 minutes walk from the hotel, he also lent us his metro card.The area is very safe, not too far from the city center and very close to the sea. We enjoyed the call for prayer to an extent that we have recorded it. As for the hotel's team they are all friendly, Ahmet (manger) arranged a day tour to Bursa (4th largest city of Turkey), it was really good and we enjoyed it, if we had arranged this tour by ourselves it would have costed us twice as much. We also got a free upgrade to a big room which was very kind of Vural, our return flight was delayed, so Vural arranged us accommodation with no additional cost.","October 10, 2014","14    Lotus Hotel Istanbul

706,"If you're looking for for a reasonably priced, clean, and safe place to stay in Istanbul, the Lotus Hotel in the Fenar section of the city is the place for you. The owner, Vural, his partner, and the rest of the staff will do whatever they need to do to make your stay pleasant and comfortable. Upon arriving, Vural meets you with a cool drink and reviews the map of the city with you and explains how to get around the city. The hotel is only a 20 minute walk from the Spice Market and the Metro Tram which will take you anywhere around the city. Since the hotel is right in the middle of a residential neighborhood, you can buy fresh bread from a bakery or other supplies you might need from the many small stores within 5 minutes of the hotel. There is even a old fashioned pharmacy right next door. The hot breakfast you will be provided with is better than any that you would be served in a downtown 5 star hotel and the best part is that it's included in your very reasonable room rate. The rooms were spacious and clean. One caution, however, is that the hotel does not have an elevator. However, the staff will be happy to carry your bags up to and down from your room. Do not hesitate to ask. If you're as out of shape as we are, I suggest you request a first floor room. If you need it, the hotel can arrange transfer service for you and your party from and to Ataturk Airport for a very reasonable 15 euro each way. That was for two people. The airport is quite far out of the city so this price really can't be beat.In summary, the Lotus Hotel had everything we needed for a pleasant, friendly stay in Istanbul while keeping within our budget. Vural will do whatever it takes to exceed your expectations. I would highly recommend the Lotus Hotel without reservation to anyone planning a visit to Istanbul.","September 1, 2014","14    Lotus Hotel Istanbul

709,"Like many have mentioned before me, Vural and his staff were friendly and accommodating to all of his guests. In my opinion, he shows more concern for his customers than any other large or small chain hotel located in the tourist district. With respect to location, it's not the most convenient hotel. However, I really liked the feeling of living in a non-touristy area, where you see kids playing in the streets and old men sitting around on the sidewalks in the evening. It's a nice break from the pack of tourists that swarm around the Sultanahmet district. That said, it's easy to take the bus to Eminonu and from there walk to the main markets (spice, Grand Bazaar) within 10-15 minutes. If you're fond of walking, it's a lovely 30-40 min walk by the water to the main attractions. I would definitely stay at Lotus hotel again if I ever were to visit Istanbul again.

Vural, which is the hotel owner makes all the difference in this property, keeping remodelled and clean rooms. He is always friendly to give you all the important information with a cup of coffee. The rooms also have new air conditioner splitters and complimentary water to keep you cool. Breakfast was included, delicious and enough to keep you up and running at noon.This neighbourhood is not downtown however buses are available a couple of blocks away. You get used to the suburban feel of the neighbours and with that in mind, we ended up having dinner in a small eatery just a few meters away from the hotel - cheap and delicious.If good service is what matters instead of a lot of amenities that you don't end up using, this hotel will surprise you.","June 21, 2014","14    Lotus Hotel Istanbul

Our room was basic but clean and perfect for what we needed. 'Life' happened in the streets around us, it was novel to go to sleep to the sounds of the local gents sitting chatting and drinking tea in the street outside our window. We mostly ate at the small eateries around Lotus - meals were delicious, very reasonably priced and it was fun to chat to the owners and passing by people and cats (of which there were many who seem to be feral but are fed, watered and sheltered well by the citizens).

Vural was extremely flexible and so helpful - the hallmark of Turkish hospitality which I've been very lucky to have had experienced. He helped us with bus tickets, directions and other random requests. The location is a wonderful one, a couple of bus stops away from the Karakoy area but not as commercialized.

I got the hotel in lira then it is changed to 70 Euro (215 lira) and charges 338 lira (8 percent tax?). this squabbling over charges is irritating as he has exchange rates different than the international exchange rate. In short, he was the most discourteous and confrontational hotel owner I have ever come across.

The price was one of the lowest I found in Istanbul, and after asking, I was given an additional discount on the rate because of the length of my stay. The room included everything mentioned on the site, plus a mini fridge which was a pleasant surprise.The hotel is a small one, so this gives you the opportunity to interact with the owner and the other guests. Breakfast is included and you get a typical Turkish breakfast with as much tea or coffee as you want. The hotel is in the middle of a community which was great because it had all the conveniences we could have needed. Also, I was able to try typical Turkish food without paying tourist prices.Although the owners of Lotus Hotel spoke very good English, not many persons in the community spoke English, but they were so kind, caring and helpful that it was not a problem. There was always someone in the lobby to help with directions to a place, ordering pizza, changing money or anything else that they could have helped with. Lotus Hotel is excellent value for money with clean rooms, hospitable service, very close to a bus stop (and depending on your mood, walking distance from Eminonu), extremely close to many conveniences, gives you a chance to interact with Turkish people and includes a delicious breakfast.

He was most helpful, especially in organising transfers to and from the airport for us at a cheaper rate than I could find anywhere on the Internet. A great addition to the large entrance and breakfast room was a small parrot whose antics were a delight as he flew around in the afternoon, perching on the rear of the tv or a large jar and chattering away to everyone.

Stuff is very friendly, kind and helpful – especially Vural who is running this place. The neighbourhood is friendly and very traditional – opposite to TAKSIM so if you want to rest in a really traditional but safe location this is the right place. You can find 2 small supermarkets, and lots of BUFEs around, so there is no problem to get food and drinks all the time.The WIFI is working well on both top floors. Breakfast is served every morning, its easy but nice.It’s not far from Ataturk Airport, however we arrived at Sabiha Gokcen Airport (about 50 km from Hotel) and took the transfer which was offered to us from the Lotus Hotel. The transfer was an easy way to get to the Hotel and was not expensive too (cca 52 € for six persons).Only thing which could be a little annoying is the muezzins call for prayer at 6.30 am every morning from the speakers which are located just opposite of the hotel.

729,"The staff was very kind and friendly, especially Ali who answered questions, gave us helpful information and remembered our name when he spoke to us. The location was good too. However, we had some issues here. Upon arrival, there was a very strong odor in our room which we believe was coming from the bathroom pipes. We opened the windows a little, turned on the exhaust fan in the bathroom and told Ali. He said he could move us the following day if it did not improve. When returning later that day, we noticed the same odor elsewhere in the hotel. This lead us to believe that it may be an issue with the old historic building. The odor in our room had not gone away entirely, but matters had improved. We felt that relocating may not change matters and elected to stay in the room. The staff accommodated us by allowing us to leave the exhaust fan running while we were out. In addition, housekeeping made an extra effort cleaning our bathroom, but we do not feel this was a cleanliness issue. However, we feel that housekeeping overstepped their boundaries by moving our personal items. None of our belongings hindered their work, but we returned to find that many of our things were stored away inside cabinets and drawers. Lastly, when we returned the last day, we found our windows wide open. There were no screens on the window and it had also rained a little. In addition, the AC was running which we did not turn on.","October 18, 2018","15    Hotel Sultan Hill

730,"We had 3 nights stay in the hotel. It took us some time to find and people in local shops didn’t know where the hotel was. We knew it was near the Blue Mosque. It was night time and we used the metro. Top tip read the metro map. The metro station we had to get to was the Alksary train metro M1a line. We had to change to a tram line T1. We had to cross through the streets to get on at Alksaray team stop for the Sultanahmet stop. You have to buy a ticket for the metro and the same card can be used on the tram. Put 20Lev on your card and share the cars. Put it on the station entry gate then pace it back when you go through. It will take of the fare per use. Each stop has a top up point. Put the card on the small screen put in the money. Say 10Lev, put the note in with the Turkish leaders face up and nearest the pay slot. You can put in coins. The room we had was basic the fridge didn’t work, the room safe didn’t work. The breakfast was in the hotel basement and is good. The hotel is near all the beast sites. Blue mosque, Haifa Sophia Museum, yerebatan Cistern, Grand Bazzar 10 minute walk and the port 15 minute walk for boat trips on the Bosphous. A very very busy city. Good restaurants, beer, wine and spirits expensive as you will know, Turkey being a Muslim County. Will go back but it will be a few years yet. A lot of sites are under renovation. Would I go back to the Hotel Sultan Hill. Yes the staff are great and it is on the doorstep of the main attractions and is a good budget price. ","July 23, 2018","15    Hotel Sultan Hill

738,"This was my second stay at this hotel in Sultanhamet. I returned because I had been so impressed by the staff and satisfied with my stay as a solo a few years before. While the hotel has no elevator, we accepted a room on the top floor because of its convenience to the rooftop, from which you can see the Blue Mosque (practically next door) and the Marmara. The bedding is not luxurious, but is comfortable. The rooms are clean, and while small, ours was adequate for two people. The stairs can be a challenge, both steep and lit with motion detector lights, but it's all part of the ambiance of an old building. Note also that the call to prayer resonates loudly due to the proximity to the Mosque ( I was able to get a couple of great recordings from my location.)Arranging a pick-up at the airport through the hotel made the arrival trouble free.The hotel staff are outstanding at this place, consistently helpful and generous in spirit.

739,"We booked this hotel directly for 80 Euros a night and given its prime location adjacent to the Blue Mosque and not far from Hagia Sophia, we were very happy with the choice. (Hotels near prime tourist attractions in other cities can be outrageous!) It's a small hote l--almost more of a bed-and-breakfast feel and there are no elevators, so keep that in mind (our room was 2 stories up, but we didn't have particularly heavy luggage at the time).The front desk clerk we encountered was so friendly and accommodating--quiet, but quick with a smile. When we checked in there was a medium-sized dog sleeping in the middle of the walkway of the lobby, which amused us. We erroneously assumed he belonged to the hotel, but the next morning, we saw him camped out in front of a different hotel across the street. There was also a friendly cat roaming the halls as well. We found this ""communal"" owning/care of animals to be a recurring theme in our time in Turkey.As for the hotel and room itself, it was an interesting mix of old- and new-school. For example the hallway lights are motion-activated, so as you walk up the stairs, your path is gradually lighted as needed (although the lights go off a little quick if you don't keep things moving). Also, you're given a traditional key to unlock your door, but that same key is connected to a device that you slip into a holder in the room to activate your lights. Our room was definitely small and modest, but it was also clean and comfortable, and just the thing we needed as a home base to return to after sightseeing.One final thing - there's a rooftop terrace that has an amazing and wonderful view of the Blue Mosque. Unfortunately, we weren't able to take advantage of the included breakfast that is apparently served up there, but I can only imagine how nice it must be to take in a meal early in the morning while gazing on the wonder of the Blue Mosque. A location that can't be beat!","September 20, 2015","15    Hotel Sultan Hill

We arrived in Istanbul on May 1st and the Taksim area was entirely closed off to prevent demonstrations. We could not get to the apartment we rented so we were stuck wandering around the Sultanahmet with our luggage. As we walked by Hotel Sultan Hill we started talking to one of the staff (maybe Ibrahim). He offered to let us store our luggage at the hotel for the day and even offered us breakfast.

752,"We stayed here for several days and really enjoyed it. The location is central for tourists yet on a quiet street directly opposite the Blue Mosque. The staff is VERY helpful and friendly. This is NOT a 4 star place with all of those bell services and room service. Its basically a pensione but it felt like home after one day and we loved coming back to our quiet hideway and retreating to the large rooftop patio. This was renovated to serve as a restaurant/lounge but the city wouldn't give permits so it has a few chairs and chaises for the hotel guests. You sit right next to the Blue Mosque which is so dramatic day or night. At night it is lit up to add to the drama of the moment. Turn away from the Blue Mosque and cast your eyes to the sea and the shipping headed into and out of the Bosporus. Its a 360 panorama that is incomparable to anything offered at the Four Seasons or any number of pricey hotels nearby. If you want a drink they will sell you wine/beer at the front desk or you can BYOB from the local shops. Some sell alcohol and some don't and I got plenty of cold shoulders for asking for wine when I didn't see it displayed (infidel!). If its not out, they don't sell it and don't think much of you for wanting it. The hotel is wood frame so there are creaks here and there. There is no elevator. We didn't notice any noise from our fellow guests and the street is narrow and lightly trafficked by cars. Just two blocks downhill is the much busier tourist ghetto so there is plenty of shopping and dining. I'm not using Ghetto in the pejorative sense. It is a nicely conceived marketplace with pedistrian only promenades and open air festival seating for entertaining, dining and drinking. It is great to have this close but not too close. 1 block up hill is the Hypodrome the ancient horse track which leads to all of the classic tourist sights that cannot be missed (get a guide so you can cut the lines!)","December 4, 2013","15    Hotel Sultan Hill

Yes, it is rather close to The Blue Mosque and you will hear the calls to prayer but that's what happens anywhere you stay since there are so many mosques in the city. Wi-Fi was free and I had a strong signal in my room. Because it was raining I did not get to see the rooftop terrace referred to by others. Location is short walking distance to the Sultanahmet tram stop I would definitely stay here again and would recommend it to friends. The only thing I might ding the hotel on was their breakfast, which compared to another hotel in the city seemed more simple.

763,"Our first impression coming to this hotel was mixed feelings, we knew that it was on a great location but the street was not a nice one (the building in front seems its going to collapse any minute). But upon entering everything changed. The hotel is a small one which makes the room also small. But regardless we liked. The receptionist were always friendly and willing to help. The terrace has an excellent view, the space for breakfast was nice, only the breakfast itself could be improved. The rooms were very clean. The location of the hotel is really excellent. So all in all a warm recommendation.","February 21, 2013","15    Hotel Sultan Hill

765,"We booked our stay direct with the hotel, we received a prompt confirmation. We requested a room on the top floor and were delighted with our wonderful views of the Blue Mosque from room 503. The roof top terrace is lovely for an evening drink, the views again are breathtaking. Service in the hotel is friendly and helpful, breakfast is continental, with nice touches such as home made jams. Location is probably the best in Istanbul, with all the sights within walking distance. In the evenings you have a good choice of places to eat. Tram stop just three minutes away if you do want to go further afield, advice available at reception for sightseeing options. The hotel organised our taxi transfer from the airport, which was nice as Istanbul is a vibrant and busy city. Our room was not huge, but spotless and had everything we needed.

766,"I booked 2 nights at the Sultan Hill in early Novemeber based on the excellent reviews and price. Terrible value. Maybe it might be considered better value in summer, but I knew it was definately not worth 80 Euros via Booking.com. I just knew. First of all, the first room they try to give us was the size of the bed. Ridiculous. I asked to see another room. With some hesitancy they showed me a bit bigger of a room, but it was on the noisy side of the hotel, and it, too, was really small. I had read that hotels in Sultanhammet are really small, but I knew this was not worth 80 EU per night. Fortunately, they let us off after one night, and I found a great hotel with elevator, views, a way better breakfast which was on a true rooftop. The SultanHill breakfast was in their basement and skimpy. They are ripping off the tourists. There were not that many other Western tourists there either. I can figure why since they give you all the bad rooms. I looked and there were other bigger rooms available, but they don't give those out. There are gazillions of nice hotels around Sultanhammet. They are all close to the Blue Mosque. If you must book one night, then look for something else. I am so glad that I left and stayed 3 more nights nearby. Especially in the fall (November), there is no problem getting a better room cheaper.","November 15, 2012","15    Hotel Sultan Hill

767,"This hotel is extremely comfortable. Everything works! Air con is a must and it has this. There is an empty fridge in your room so you can pop a cold beer or white wine plus some munchies inside and take up on to the roof terrace in the evening as a pre-dinner 'delight'! The views from the Roof Terrace of the Bosphorus and in particular the Blue Mosque are stupendous - you are quite simply 'right there' in the heart of the best the city has: Blue Mosque, Hippodrome, Palace, list goes on. It is an up-market area with the Arasta Bazaar down the road with the highly recommended Jennifer's Hamam selling eco-stunning towels and more - you have to visit this lovely Canadian lady selling only the best pure Turkish products. Tamara Restaurant is highly recommended by us too! The Staff at the Sultan Hill Hotel, could not have been more helpful and charming, having helped us with are daily expeditions (especially where to walk on the ancient walls) and also arranged the reasonably priced airport transfer. The breakfasts, too are worth a mention - delicious.Thank you to all those at this superb Hotel - we (2 families) had the most wonderful time!","October 27, 2012","15    Hotel Sultan Hill

The other view from the terrace is the sea.Most key tourist sites like the Hajia Sophia, Grand Bazar and the Topkapi is within a few minutes walk. For all other places the tran stop is just a small walk away.The breakfast is meager but well organised. Everything usual expect a live kitchen.If there was a disappoitment it was that the room always had a stink coming perhaps grom the sewage system.

Since you are about 10 ft. from the blue mosque, you WILL hear the call to prayer every morning.

771,"The rooms are basic, generally clean, but a bit dusty. Our bathroom was musty and a bit moldy in the shower, and the plumbing leaked all over the floor, so was pretty wet after a few minutes in the shower. And the bed was on the hard side, with only one sheet.Breakfast was decent. Nice yogurt and fruit, with an assortment of cold meats, cheese, bread and coffee/tea/juice. The staff were friendly and accommodating.The main thing going for this place is location. It's right in the heart of things - an easy stroll to all the sights... Mind you, being right next to the Blue Mosque, be prepared to be woken up at 4:30am for morning prayers.Overall, average place, but perhaps not the best value, with nicer hotels nearby for the same price.","June 10, 2012","15    Hotel Sultan Hill

772,"Like some other TripAdvisor contributors, I discovered Hotel Sultan Hill in the Rick Steves' Istanbul guidebook. The many positive reviews about the hotel here on TripAdvisor convinced me to book it for my vacation to Istanbul. Reserving the room prior to arrival was easy, with all of my e-mails answered promptly by the hotel staff. Upon arrival, the hotel was only a 5 minute walk from the Sultanahmet tram stop. Breakfast every morning consisted of sliced meats and cheeses, sliced tomatoes and cucumbers, dry cereals, dry and fresh fruit, hard-boiled eggs, breads and pastries, GREAT coffee, tea, juice, olives, fresh yogurt, and several jams and spreads. The small but cozy room featured cold air-conditioning, great water pressure in the shower with ample hot water, good sheets on the bed and towels in the bathroom, and Turkish and English (CNN, BBC) channels on the television. The hotel, open since 2005, is overall very clean throughout. Upon check-out, I received a 15% discount on the 60 Euro a night rate for being a follower of Rick Steves and showing his Istanbul guidebook during the check-in process. I am very satisfied that I stayed in this hotel for nine nights, and would readily recommend this hotel to anyone looking to travel to Istanbul. However, this hotel may not be suitable for persons with mobility issues, as the hotel only has stairs and does not have an elevator. Also, anyone with insomnia may not want to choose this hotel, as the last call to prayer at the Blue Mosque next door is around 9:30 pm at night, with the first call to prayer around 5:30 am in the morning. Finally, there are some dilapidated buildings in the immediate vicinity of the hotel, but it is my understanding that these will soon be upgraded. However, the hotel's location still felt and was very safe. TripAdvisor currently rates this hotel around #100 of around 700 hotels in Istanbul. There is no doubt in my mind that if the wonderful staff of Hotel Sultan Hill continues to perform at the level that I experienced during my stay, this hotel will soon be a Top 25 hotel in Istanbul.","April 14, 2012","15    Hotel Sultan Hill

773,"This hotel has an amazing location - you are within close walking distance of the Blue Mosque, Haya Sofia, Grand Bazaar, Topkapi Palace. The staff are wonderful, very friendly. The rooms are rather small (and so it the doublebed) but this is an historical area and the hotel is set in an old house so you cannot expert huge suites. The only downside is that if you are a light sleeper you will be woken up very early (5 am) by the very loud call to prayer from the Blue Mosque, by loudspeakers. At the same time it's great to stay so close to this historical area and it certainly adds to the atmosphere (but not to the sleepquality).","April 12, 2012","15    Hotel Sultan Hill

The only downsides were they have key based electricity and mine didn't like to work very well.

778,"No frills hotel located right behind the Blue Mosque. Good location to discover Sultanahmet. Room and bathroom are basic but clean. Breakfast is ok, nothing to rave about. Regular coffee is really bad though, turkish coffee is available but at additionnal charges, rather surprising for a Turkish hotelNot really recommended for seniors or people with disabilities, the stairs are pretty steep going up to the 3 or 4 th floor. Make sure that the A/C is working in the room. It was not in mine. One last issue, the hotel is literally right behind the Mosque, so one must expect to be abruplty awaken by the loud call of prayers in the morning. It is always an experience the first time.One other suggestion, no need to use the shuttle service from the Hotel (they charge 25 Euros). It is much cheaper to hire a cab.

Overall the rooms are very good. Comfy beds. Nice whirpool system. Only downside is its family orientated hotel so they don't allow guests and making too much of a noise.

805,"If you a lover of chain hotels then stay away but if like me, you enjoy experiencing something more akin to the city's tradition, then Next2 is perfect. The hotel is in a side street only minutes from istaklal Street right next to a police station which was well protected, never felt safer!Built almost 140 years ago and a former apartment bulding the team here have and are still restoring this to its former glory. From the entrance where the they have restored the original floor tiles and uncovered part of the original ceiling the hotel is modern yet traditional and quirky.There are 11 suites over 5 floors. My room was more of an apartment, with a full kitchen, 2 bedrooms, a toilet and a bathroom with superb shower and complimentary shower gels etc.The bed was super comfortable, the floors are stripped back and it had quirky window shutters that kept the light out for a good nights sleep. The room was at the back so there wasn't a view but we only slept there so wasn't a problem for us. A traditional Turkish breakfast was available each morning and the staff offered eggs cooked the way you wanted and as much coffee as you could drink.The wifi was also brilliant. They have clearly invested in a good wifi package. It worked all the time, was strong and there was no complicated password system which so many chain hotels seem to love.A huge plus was the staff themselves. Every one without exception were friendly and helpful, especially Tolga on reception. I needed to make a small change to my booking before i arrived, I was surprised that you can reach them even on whatsapp. I spoke to the General Manager Mustafa and Tolga who sorted out the issue. Nothing was too much trouble for this team!I would happily stay there again!","September 27, 2016","16    Hotel Next2

823,"This was my tenth visit to Ist, so I have an experience about hotels in this city. Location - very nice, almost in the middle of Istiklal street (one of the most popular streets, on Taksim square), just two minutes walking, and cca 10 mins from the square. We had a triple room nr. 401, very big (which is unusual for turkish hotels), big windows, very clean, comfortable. Nice bathroom, shower, hot water. Breakfast - small area, but everything you need. They will make you a coffee/tea, eggs, you have bread, butter, cream, yoghurt, nice start of the day. Staff - they are very friendly, cute, you have tee/coffee as welcome. Pretty convenient for airport transport. If you are coming from Ataturk, take a metro red line (there is only one line which goes from the airport), get out at Yenikapi, and change to green line direction Haciosman, and get out at Taksim), go through Istiklal street, and opposite of mosque, turn left, after few metres, there is a police station, and below it, you will find this hotel (with Istanbulcard it costs 4-5 TL), or take a Havatas bus which drops you off in front of the Point hotel (so go to Taksim square and then ...), for 11 TL.All things considered, I recommend you this hotel due to it's cleanliness, location, staff and finally, price!!!

It is a small apartment building with a dozen or so units, and operates like a hybrid Airbnb and hotel—you get some hotel like services.

Then for a week we spoke with him every day, he gave us advice, answered our endless questions about the economy, culture, history, etc. So useful and fun to talk to. And he helped us book things when we needed it. Just an amazing guy.The room was great, with a small kitchen and bathroom. The building has a gym, sauna and a rooftop terrace to hang out on—with a view of the Marmara Sea.

Highly recommend this hotel for anyone looking for a practical and very affordable place to stay- it is conveniently located in the centre of the city so everything is not far by foot . Although I highly recommend bringing a good pair or runners as the streets have very high and low hills .","April 24, 2018","17    Cube Suites

843,"We booked the room from Airbnb It’s an Airbnb with professional service!We had our stay at Yusuf’s from 24th Feb 2018 to 9th Mar 2018. Everything is higher than our expectations. Let me list why is that: 1. Friendly staff:Yusuf, Yunus, Erol, Emir, they are all served and welcome you from the bottom of their hearts.2. Location:Very convenient. You can walk to any attractions in Fatih within 15 mins. There are 3 mini-markets 5 mins by walk and a shop where you can buy water, pops and bread right next door. 10 mins walk to tram stop and atm or currency exchange shop.3. Room:Just as they show on the website, and the size of bathtub is proper. Kitchen is bit tiny but useful. 4. Facility: Lobby is severed with cofffe, tea and cookie all day. Turkish bath and sauna you must try.5. Sevice: Like I said, even it’s an Airbnb. But you can get your room clean up with their housekeepers. And all the staff are helpful and nice. This is the best Airbnb staying experience I’ve ever had. Strongly recommend! 我們是在Airbnb上預訂的說是Airbnb，其實更像是小型旅館！這次入住分成兩段，兩種房型（套房跟一房一廳）我跟女友都很滿意。以下是我們認為值得推薦的部分：1. 友善的員工Yusuf、 Yunus、 Erol、 Emir及房務人員都非常專業及具服務熱誠。2. 位置 非常方便，離Fatih的所有景點都約莫15分鐘的步行路程；5分鐘路程左右有3間小型超市；而隔壁就有一家小商店，水、飲料及生活用品都能買到。到電車站、換匯店及ATM大概是10分鐘就能走到。3. 房間 就如同網站上照片一樣。浴缸的大小適中；而廚房小了點，但還是能煮些小東西！4. 設施 在大廳有提供免費的茶、咖啡及餅乾；還有你千萬要試試他們贈送免費一次的酒店土耳其浴，就在地下室。5. 服務 就如同前面提到的，雖然是Airbnb，但服務一點也不馬虎；房務人員每天都會來打掃，而所有的員工都很友善、熱心。非常值得推薦！","March 12, 2018","17    Cube Suites

861,"We stayed here on our 10th anniversary trip in April, and it was easily one of the best places we stayed during our entire trip. The building is pretty plain from the outside, but the neighborhood is charming and relatively quiet. Even though it was a very short walk to most of the main sights, it's not a super touristy area. It seemed very local to us - lots of apartments with ordinary residents, with plenty of shops and restaurants at street level. The hotel itself is beautiful. The rooms and lobby are recently renovated, with a kind of industrial/steampunk design motif. The hamam-style bath and sauna in the basement were incredibly relaxing, and one of the highlights of our trip. Yusuf and his staff were absolutely amazing. They made sure we had everything we needed, and were super attentive and kind. We were offered coffee, tea, and cookies every time we came into the building, and Yusuf's travel advice was invaluable. The room itself was just as beautiful as the rest of the hotel. Great contemporary design with a little kitchenette where we made coffee and tea in the mornings. It was simultaneously one of the most luxurious and one of the least expensive places we stayed during our entire four-week vacation. I can't recommend Yusuf's place enough.

Yusuf and his brother truly enjoy what they do as they are great hosts and at your service 24 hours a day to assist with whatever you need.Yusufs apartments are conveniently located in the best location for a visit Istanbul. The area is quiet, and away from the noise and crowds but close to many attractions.From Ataturk airport, you're looking at a 20-40 min taxi ride depending on traffic (we paid 60 Lira for the taxi each way). The accommodation is a short 5 minute walk to the Blue Mosque, Aya Sofia, Cistern basilica and 10-15 minutes to the Grand Bazaar.During your walks you will notice that the area is also loaded with tons of great authentic Turkish restaurants. We would recommend you try lunch at the 'local restaurant' which is directly across the street from Yusufs apartments. For dinner try 'Amedros' near the Blue Mosque. They have great food, wine, and service.Public transportation is also a short walk from Yusuf's apartment. Street car and metro to Taksim square costs 12 lira. I highly recommend the hop on/off double decker bus from the Blue Mosque to fully discover all of Istanbul. Cost was 125 Lira for a two day pass.Thank you Yusuf.

880,"Firstly, let me say that the rooms were bigger than your average hotel with a little kitchenette, which was nice. The shower was great and bed was comfortable. Also, one of the only (more modern) hotels in the old city.Yusuf, was very helpful and offered us some tourist information as well as turkish coffe and biscuits when we arrived, which we were then told that no breakfast was served in the morning (we were aware of this) but that was the last offer of coffee and biscuits we received up until we left the hotel. Also, the cleaning service wasn't great and we had some issues with our toilet and very difficult to figure out the tv (mostly turkish programmes anyway).There were some workers doing renovation, who could hardly wait until we left our room to leave the hotel, before they came inside. When we wanted to leave the hotel and requested a taxi through them, they said that there was a convention happening in Taksim and would not be able to gain access with a car to our other hotel for the next few days. We then decided to call the new hotel to find out from them, whether they could see any issue with regards to access to their hotel and said everything was fine & said they are lying to keep us there. It seemed more like they wanted to make it difficult for us to get to our new place so that they could make us stay longer at their hotel (I could be wrong but we had been scammed so many times in Istanbul up until that point, I would not put it past them to do that).In my opinion, not a bad hotel but not enough attention to detail.","April 20, 2016","17    Cube Suites

It wasn't a problem for us but just double check what you've booked (the pics are a little deceiving). There is no washing machine or microwave in the apartment (contrary to facilities info on booking.com) - these are downstairs- you can notify management and laundry will be done. The double beds are actually 2 single matresses. Other than that, it is tastefully decorated and cosy.Shops, supermarkets etc are within short walking distance - so is Taksim square, Istiklal street etc. The area can get a bit noisy though.Our host (Enes) was very accommodating and open to suggestions for improvement (we suggested a microwave oven in the apartment would be great).

898,"I was so pleased we chose to stay in one of MySuite Istanbul's self-catering apartments for our four nights in Istanbul at the end of July. Located in the hip neighbourhood of Beyoglu, the apartment is surrounded by loads of great coffee shops and restaurants popular with locals, and it is conveniently within walking distance of Galata Tower and Taksim Square, as well as loads of great shopping along Istiklal Avenue. I especially enjoyed being surrounded by locals instead of tourists!The host, Enes, was very welcoming, superbly efficient and so friendly – nothing was too much trouble, and he is very responsive to your needs. MySuite Istanbul includes a Metro card onto which you load credits for totally convenient travelling on the public transport system. Tophane station is just minutes away down the (steep) hill, which itself is just 5 quick stops from Sultanahmet. We stayed there together with our teenage sons (aged 13 and 16), and it was great to have a self-catering place (with WiFi) where we could put together our own breakfasts before heading off for the day. With such delicious Turkish food all around, though, we strolled to local restaurants for all our other meals. MySuite Istanbul is a winner!","August 1, 2018","18    MySuite Istanbul Cihangir Square

907,"On my most recent visit to My Suite, I stayed in Piya's Turquoise #4, although I have stayed in several other residences belonging to the property. Almost identical to the Piya's Turquoise residence on the floor below, #4 has charming decoration, a well-designed combination of boho-ethnic and modern. Thus, the space avoids a lot of the ""Turkish kitsch"" that are ubiquitous in Istanbul tourist hotels. My Suite residences are an excellent choice if you want space, freedom, and adventure. As someone who lived for 5 years in Turkey as an ex-pat and someone with a wide range of accommodation options across various neighborhoods in Istanbul, I can say without a doubt that My Suite is my favorite. I have been staying here consistently on every visit to Istanbul since 2016. The Cihangir neighborhood is best for younger people, solo travelers, hipsters, and those who like adventures. If you want easy access to the ancient sites in Sultanahmet, this is not the place for you. If you don't want to navigate the winding side streets and ups and downs of urban hills of Beyoglu and around, this is not for you. If you want a sanitized, tourist version of the city, this is not for you. If you are a family with kids, this is probably not for you. For everyone else, My Suite is a fantastic choice. Istiklal Cad. (around which much of the shopping and nightlife buzzes) is a few minutes away, but not so close that you feel choked by the crowds and noise. You can still reach the tourist sites, but you'll do it like a local. The crowd and atmosphere around Cihangir favors intellectuals, artists, ex-pats, hipsters, as well as folks who've been in the neighborhood for generations. If you like stumbling across antique shops, boho design galleries, bookshops, and so-trendy-we-aren't-trendy cafes, stay here. If you are a return visitor to Istanbul and just want to relax and hang out around the city, My Suite is an excellent choice. I love the freedom residential stay offers--you can make full meals yourself or enjoy leisurely coffees and happy hours in a relaxed space. I love sitting on the balcony with a coffee or glass of wine and listening to the noise of the city at the beginning of the day or before a fun night out with friends. This is particularly nice if you're on a budget and don't want to spend a lot on the pricey and meh cocktails/drinks around town (i.e, pre-game here!), Management is capable and efficient, but never overbearing. Overall, the level of cleanliness, taste, and comfort these residences offer is unlike anything else at the 3 or 4-star level in Istanbul. The prices are incredibly reasonable if you have foreign currency. Anyone an bring home pictures of the Agia Sophia, but stay here and you just might get to know Zeynep, who runs a fair trade design studio with her brother when she's not weekending in Paris, or the local baker who can explain to you the history and significance of Ramazan pide; anyone can order a same-same kebab in Sultanahment, stay here and you can find vegan kebabs or line up for unforgettable breakfasts at hole-in-the-wall Van Kahvalti Evi (and don't be surprised if you find yourself sipping tea or coffee next to famous Turkish writers and musicians). My Suite Istanbul is truly unique--I highly recommend them.","March 31, 2018","18    MySuite Istanbul Cihangir Square

921,"Perfect choice for a staycation in Istanbul! The flats of Mysuites Istanbul are set up in a way that you easily feel home there. Instead of staying in a hotel I had booked this accommodation that was recommended by a friend to me and i did not regrett it one minute. After a warm welcome and introduction into the flat's set up (there was even milk provided for my coffee ☺) I set out to explore the city while returning ""home"" to relax in the evening, sitting with a glass of wine on the balcony. The staff of Mysuites Istanbul was very helpful and always reachable. They even provided a simple phone to make sure I could call in case of need which I found very thoughtful as I was travelling as a single female. I would definitely chose it again and already think about planning my next trip to my ""home"" in Istanbul ! ","September 16, 2016","18    MySuite Istanbul Cihangir Square

925,"We went to visit Istanbul 1 year ago. Pro: The place was small but nicely designed (we felt comfortable inside), very clean, and strategic (near to tram station, metro station, Istanbul street, groceries and restaurants). We had everything we needed inside (1 bed + 1 sofa bed, pretty & clean bathroom & toilet, pretty small kitchen with dishwasher, toaster, water heater, eating utensils, cooking utensils even olive oil, vinegar and salt, fridge etc). The people who were running the place (Cihan & Enes) have been very helpful. They provided us Istanbul metro card, mobile phone with local sim card, welcome wine and Turkish delight, too. With all the plus sides, price was also quite reasonable.Cons: The room was in another building which was in a bit hilly location, and might be not easy to move your luggage by yourself there. But, this was a minor dislike. Cihan & Enes had helped us moving our luggages to and from the room after check in and check out. Overall this was a good stay!","July 23, 2016","18    MySuite Istanbul Cihangir Square

You are welcomed warmly, we were given an upgrade which is always a great start, and the owners/managers provide you with a local phone and an Istanbul Kart for travel as well as water and milk, coffee, tea, etc. The décor is lovely - very bohemian and artistic. It's quite rustic and homely and we immediate felt relaxed. The apartment we were in was lovely and spacious with a nice little balcony and beautiful tiling and features. It's also very light and airy.Mysuites is in a great location surrounded by coffee shops and great places for breakfast and food. It's a short walk to Karakoy (great coffee shops and you must try Gumruk!), Istiklal Caddesi (the main street) and lots of amazing restaurants in Cihangir (Limonlu was one of our favourites). There were a couple of features of the apartment which needed some maintenance (e.g. the shower was not so great at draining and the bathroom often ended up as a wet room) but they did not effect the stay and for the value, this is a fantastic place to stay.","June 23, 2016","18    MySuite Istanbul Cihangir Square

935,"Me and my girlfriend were initially staying in city centre and wanted to explore the suburbs of Istanbul. We took an hours drive until we came across Agva; a small yet vibrant town which is by the sea and between the mouth of two rivers! With local amenities, luscious green space as well as a sandy beach, we decided to stay for the night. We were told by the locals that there was essentially a strip on the riverside where most of the towns hotels and B&Bs were based. Out of the many establishments we saw, Riverangel Hotel caught our attention!From the outside, the hotel is colourful and full of life, with trees and flowers planted in every corner. The reception was grand; a spacious lobby where we were welcomed by our host, Rengin.Our room (Dreamcatcher), was spectacular. A master bedroom with a modern feel, and special touches such as the craftsmanship and furniture making it truly unique. The high quality service from the staff was only reflective of everything else we had seen so far, very friendly and attentive.The breakfast was a good size. A variety of things you would expect, as well as a few Turkish specialities! We are so glad that this unexpected visit to Agva had turned into a truly amazing experience. For anyone visiting Istanbul, a visit to this amazing town is recommended, and a stay at Riverangel is the only way to go!","May 23, 2019","19    Agva Riverangel Hotel

The rooms are spacious, clean and very well equipped. The breakfast is amazing, tea time in the afternoon is a nice little treat. The garden and pool is a great little oasis to relax after sightseeing. Unfortunately the stuff in the garden is not service-minded nor fast. However this is the only tiny downside, but does not at all affect my overall very good impression of the hotel. The hotel is perfectly located in walking distance to more or less everything you need to see and experience. I highly recommended to have dinner at the rooftop terrace at the Sura hotel across the street (Sura Design Hotel). This is a fantastic restaurant, with an amazing view of the city, really delicious food and great service at a very reasonable price.

Even asked me to contact him should i have any issues as i went around Istanbul.Another person Mr Mohammad, I saw him at the tour desk last night 22/06/19.With less that 1 hour to go he quickly made arrangements for us to attend the evening dinner/cruise. Since we're late he quickly booked us a taxi and took the contact number of the taxi driver to make sure we reach our destination safely.Mr Yahya, i see him at the breakfast booth.

The staff was friendly and did help us every time we had a request. The breakfast was ok but most of time, it was crowded and does not offer a wide choice. But the food was good and tasty at the various hotel restaurants - we tried them all. The room was a bit on the small-side, but that's what you get in big cities anyway. I took away one star in the rating as the standard is a bit below a real international's 5-star hotel. The NYE party was held on the ""N Terrace"" and we had a great time, with a great view over the Bosphorus and Istanbul night view. Too bad, the city is no longer allowed to organise a ""real"" firework show - but some residents did their own and it was lovely and festive. We would recommend it despite the weather was a bit cold and rainy at that time of the year. We also loved shopping at the various malls in the City.","May 13, 2019","20    Sura Hagia Sophia Hotel

By the way, all of these attractions are located within walking distances from the hotel. The staff also helped us with a dinner cruise at the Bosphorus. Lastly, we have to mention the exemplary services provided by Mr. Zekeriya, the manager of the restaurant.

The towels however, were quite rough. Our room service cleaner Havva was very thorough and made sure our room was spotless each day. The views from all three rooms were not great, they looked over the back street. The buffet breakfast was not as I expected for a 5 star hotel. There were many bread/bakery options but very limited hot options. There was a good range of cold meats, cheese and olives but there needs to more options for the “mains.” Scrambled and boiled eggs were available but there was no omelet station. An extra charge for omelette or fried egg. The hotel is very conveniently located with all the major attractions a short walking distance away.

Driver was waiting for us at the airport with a placard so easily identifiable. Smooth ride to the hotel. Lots of traffics though.Check in:When we arrived at the hotel, we were warmly welcomed by the hotel porters who took our luggage in. While waiting to be checked in, we were offered some turkish tea while we waited. It was a quick process.. However, when we got to the room, to our surprise it was a double room with a small sofabed. We had booked a standard triple room with 3 single beds via Agoda. We went back to the reception and explained but according to them, they don't have standard triple rooms in their hotel and advised us to contact the Agoda who we booked with. They then however said they will give us triple bedroom the next day, when some guests check out. Yahya and Ismail at the reception were very helpful indeed and sorted it out for us. So for 1 night, we had to make do with that room. The next day, we were shifted to a triple room. Unfortunately it was in the basement so literally no nice views at all but at least we had our 3 beds. The room seemed to be s standard triple. So it was a rocky start to the holiday.....however it only got better after that....Location:The hotel was in a superb location. A soon as you come out of the hotel, their were plenty of restaurants to eat at. Their was money exchange shop, and also many sweet shops too where we could but turkish delights, cakes and desserts and fresh orange and pomeranate juices too. The Blue mosque, Topkapi Palace, and Hagia Sophia were just few minutes away. The tram was also just 2 minutes away.Hotel Breakfast:Breakfast had a fairly good variety, but I have had much better breakfast ath 5* hotels in Turkey as well as other parts of the world. There was no omelete or fried egg available - You had to pay extra 15Lira for fried egg and 20Lira for an omelette. The orange juice said 'fresh' but it was certainly not fresh. It was from concentrate and tasted stale. There was a good variety of olives and fruit so we enjoyed that at breakfast. The positive thing was that we could choose to have our breakfast at their sister hotel across the road - Sura Design hotel. We preferred it there as it was less crowded and had a beautiful view overlooking the Blue Mosque. Apart from the first day, we had our breakfast at the Sura Design hotel for the rest of the stay.Staff:The staff were the highlight of our stay at the hotel. They were always smiling and greeting us, asking us if we needed anything at all. A special mention to Cemre Ugurlu - the Front Office Manager/ Guest Relations. She was the most friendliest person I ever met. She was always happy to help. Nothing was too much trouble for her. She really made our day everytime we saw her and spoke to her.Another special mention to the concierge supervisor -Turgay Yasar- He was also very helpful and a very nice guy. If we needed a taxi to go anywhere, it was ordered for us straight away and taxi would collect us from the hotel.The 5 stars for this hotel are predominantly due to the Team working at the hotel. They are an asset to the hotel.TeatimeThe hotel offered free tea and snacks everyday between 5 and 6pm which was quite nice. Checkout:Very smooth checkout and transfer to the airport. Thank you to Cemre again for a great sendoff :)All in all a very good experience. We loved Istanbul and its people. Improvements:*I would suggest that the hotel should make available a small prayer room for guests. We checked out at 12pm. Our flight was in the evening. We wanted to say our prayers but the staff said there was no prayer room available. This should be standard considering it is a Muslim country. All the shopping areas we went to had a prayer room available.*Should include omelette/fried eggs as standard during breakfast. Fresh orange juice would be a nice addition too.","March 19, 2019","20    Sura Hagia Sophia Hotel

It is a larger hotel for the area and is situated on a narrow street. This does create issues, but nothing the Staff can't handle. If you are going to see Istanbul this hotel is almost the perfect location. The downside? Since it is a larger hotel there is always a crowd at the front desk, the eating area can get noisy and the internet was terrible to the point where I went to another Sura owned property. I would not recommend reserving transportation with the hotel from the airport to the hotel, unless very late, as there are lots of alternatives and my driver was 55 minutes late....

1028,"Firstly, when we booked the hotel online we thought we were going to stay at Bucoleon Palace Hotel but we ended up at Bucoleon by Cheers. Both are owned by the same person. Me and my friend felt like we got catfished.The room was not that clean and there was visible dust everywhere, the mini fridge was disgusting and was not working. Some of the plug sockets were coming out of the wall. The bathroom was of an OK standard. The furniture was very old. The towels were not of a good quality and the bedsheets were okish.... Thankfully the aircon worked. The walls were VERY thin. The hotel had a bar and they order food in for you but there are so many restaurants within walking distance its not a major brownie point.The location was perfect because it was near all the attractions.Breakfast was included- not wow but average, I have had better. They had the same variety everyday. All the staff were lovely and extremely helpful. However, when I wanted to book a taxi to go to the airport I was advised by one of the staff members it would cost about 140 TL. Thankfully I did not get him to book it as when I booked a taxi at the time of needing one it cost 60TL!!! I felt that was cheeky of them!The hotel needs modernising. If I was to go back to Istanbul, I wouldn't return to the same hotel purely because I think that bit of extra money you can get better quality by miles.

Our room was also extremely noisy and we were able to hear people on the street talking for most of the night. The location was great and staff friendly but there are many alternatives in the same area so I’d choose them over this.

1034,"If you're lucky enough to visit the amazing city Istanbul, I would recommend you to stay at Bucoleon. Why? Firstly, Istanbul is an incredible big city, why you will safe a lot of time by staying central. Bucoleon is fortunately located very central in the heart of the old city, which allows you to walk to many different attractions, such as the Blue Mosque. Secondly, even though Bucoleon have such a central location it is located in a quite and very authentic neighborhood, which allows you to escape the otherwise pretty noise city. Furthermore, when you arrive at Bucoleon you will be greeted by an amazing friendly and english-speaking staff (important). The rooms were nice and very clean - and there is aircondition which is needed during the summer-period! And you MUST to go the room-top (see pictures ;-)) and enjoy they amazing ocean view while enjoying your traditional Turkish breakfast! You definitely get a lot of hotel for a very cheap price! I would therefore recommend Bucoleon to students/couples/families who are looking for a nice and good quality hotel for a cheap price.A quick sum up: Very friendly English speaking staff, nice rooms (good beds), aircondition, central location, amazing rooftop, restaurants close by.","June 9, 2018","21    Bucoleon by Cheers

1038,"First of all, I rarely (if ever) write bad reviews for places, but I think that people need an honest review of this hotel. I booked this hotel because it had good reviews on most sites and the pictures looked beautiful. We booked 5 nights here, and had very high expectations. I did my research and booked a more expensive room to ensure I had the view of the Blue Mosque from the window. I even wrote a special request for this room! Upon arrival, we checked in and were led down into the basement. Our room was big, but looked nothing like what we had seen in the pictures. Instead of a view of the mosque, we had a sea view... through a barbed wire fence. We had a patio, which was littered with cigarette butts and other garbage. Even the patio furniture was old and rusted. The entire room was dated, the bed sheets were stained, it was just totally disappointing. The following morning we located a nearby hotel with cheaper rates and much nicer rooms. We told the manager that we were disappointed in the room and would like to check out early. He told us that we would still need to pay for 5 nights, even if we left. He proceeded to explain that since I had written a request, they had upgraded us to the ""seaview room"". I told him we had requested the mosque view, and that the photos are completely misleading. He told us that he could give us the smaller room we had booked, but then showed us another seaview room. After avoiding it a while longer, he showed us the mosque view room and agreed to give it to us. I just cannot understand how much he resisted putting us in the room we'd booked and paid for. The staff did give us a free bottle of wine, a fruit tray, and an apology letter. That was very nice, and quite appreciated. However, even this new room was disappointing. The shower door was missing a pane of glass, and each time we showered, water sprayed on the toilet and floor. The bathroom door was broken and would not stay closed. We had to put a backpack against the door to keep it shut while using the bathroom.Our balcony door was broken and could not be opened without coming off. There were cigarette butts on our windowsill. The towels and sheets were stained and ripped.Additionally, the breakfast was pretty disappointing. This was our fourth hotel in Turkey, and was a real let down. Honestly, I really REALLY wanted to like this hotel, but they make no effort to keep it clean or in good condition. They don't honor the bookings people make. I just wouldn't recommend it, and would not stay here again.","March 5, 2018","21    Bucoleon by Cheers

Free breakfast in the morning. Right in the Sultanahmet Neighborhood. Close to everything. But best of all, the staff treats you like family.

1042,"First of all, do not believe in the pictures of this place, they are showing us fake pictures of this place, totally photoshopped. To make it short:- The rooms are not at all like the pictures, in fact, they smell very bad, the place is full of refugees (very loud people). Barely clean...- They FORCE you to pay by cash and they refuse to give you bill if you ask for it.If you insist on getting the bill they will put you out of their hotel (very rude and aggressive staff). The reason they do not give a bill: if you book with agoda/booking, they cancel your reservation so you CAN NOT write a review in those websites, without the bill you can not prove you were there.Many bad surprises in this place, do not book in this place if you want to enjoy your holidays in Turkey...Also, be aware of their staff, the ""manager"" is a liar, very aggressive person...do not let them intimidate you. They will try to make you scared and put you out of the hotel as soon as you complain...","December 7, 2017","21    Bucoleon by Cheers

1044,"We had been in Bucoleon hotel three times before. Never had booked it ahead. We would always visit that place and most of the time they had free room. This is a clean hotel and the building is cosy and some rooms have a nice view of the see. But most of the staff are rude and not helping. Anyway, last weekend I decided to book a room in Bucoleon before we go there. I wrote on the booking.com site that we would be there between 22-23. Our plane had delay and when we arrived at the hotel it was 23:40. Which is not an unusual delay. The reception told us that we should go and stay in their other building (he said the hotel has two separate buildings!) and the room they are going to give us is the exact same room that we had booked. Then he guided us to another hotel (!) which was two buildings apart. Made us climb 4 floors to the room which has nothing in common with the room we had booked. We had been in the room that I had booked, 3 times before, so we knew what we had reserved. It was so embracing. There was nothing in common between the two hotels. We refused to accept that room and I complained about the situation. The reception guy told us that he understands how embarrassing this is, but they had just gave the room we had booked to another passenger and the manager had told him to do so.We asked him to give back our money. He called the manager/owner of the hotel. The manager wanted me on the phone and SO SHAMELESSLY told me that there was a water leakage in the room we had booked and offered us to stay in another room with a considerable discount and he would move us back to our room early in the morning! I never expected an owner/manager of a hotel to give their customers lie after lie. We did not accept his discount offer and left the place. It took them a long time to give us back our money.My overall experience of this hotel shows they have no respect for the costumers.","December 21, 2016","21    Bucoleon by Cheers

He even helped us with all of our luggages (7 luggages in total :O) To my understanding, this hotel was just operated within a few weeks. So, there's no breakfast provided but maybe this service would be available later. The location is just a stone's throw to Sultanahmet mosque and there are many restaurants, grocery stores and even airport transfers offices nearby. Cheap price with an amazing stay. However if you're someone who wants a luxurious stay, this is not something for you. The hotel is clean and comfortable with all the necessary amenities.

1084,"If you are looking for a great business hotel in Istanbul on the Asian side then I can highly recommend Radisson Blu Tuzla, one of the best hotels I stayed at in this area.It is in close proximity of SAW airport so when arriving tired at night this is only a short 5 min. ride away.The hotel have many plus sides such as:- large rooms with plenty of space- super comfy beds- the hotel is fairly new build so interiors looks good.- super friendly and helpful staff- great breakfast.- one of the best gyms I have experienced in a hotel.- I like the one-touch app for all your needs @ Radisson.On the minus side is the isolated location, however if you are there for business then in my opinion all the positive sides of the hotel outweighs this one and their pricing adjusts for this also.Radisson Blu Tuzla remains my go to hotel in Istanbul’s Asian side ","July 5, 2019","23    Radisson Blu Hotel & Spa - Istanbul Tuzla

Staffs here are nice and welcome. You can actually spend whole day in the hotel. I arrived late and left at noon so i didnt spend my time much. Gym is very big and also big swimming pool. A must to do here is Spa, in very reasonable price but unfortunately it’s fully booked and i need to leave so no chance for me for spa.

Other side of highway is an industrial area. Not much to do around.We have stayed one night only as our flight was delayed and we have to take another flight in night. We have been pleasantly suprised with standard of hotel and well trained, professional staff. Our front desk personal was well traint, polate and helpful. Saying this, Radisson in other countries never put us down. Room was clean, spacious and quite. Bed was big and comfy. Breakfast was very good, so was lunch.Saying all of this, I have to add hotel is not good for a holiday seekers looking to spend time in Istambul as is not close to the main city area and tourist attractions. But if you like resorts type of holiday, there is shuttle bus at hotel and this maybe place to be? Indoor and outdoor pool, although temperature of outdoor pool when we stayed in October was 15 Celsius with outside temperature of 17 Celsius.

Location is not particularly the best if you are looking for a place to stay near one of many city centers in Istanbul. Breakfast has quantity>quality concept so there were many items to choose from but the taste factor was average at best. Had to go through a security screening with the local police each time we entered the hotel on the only road leading up to the premises due to heightened security in the area. Overall, I would recommend this hotel if you are in between flights through SAW and need a place to relax before you catch your next flight.

1112,"I recently stayed here for a Business Trip.Location is close to sabiha gökçen airport and was only about 10 minutes away from my office. This is not a hotel I would recommend to stay at if you are in Istanbul for a holiday as it is not close to the main city area or tourist spots.The actual hotel was really nice though and was a nice surprise as I was not expecting much considering the location. The room was huge, and had a big bathroom with a rain shower, no bath though. Bed is comfortable. TV did not have many English channels (maybe one?).One gripe I do have about my room, every evening from about 6pm to 9pm there was a weird thumping noise, it sounded a lot like someone was dropping a heavy weight on the floor, it was so loud that it vibrated the room. The first night I thought that maybe I was close to the gym so I called to ask where the gym was located and it was no where near my room. I was also on the top floor so again not sure where this noise was coming from. I wear earplugs when trying to sleep but this noise was so loud that the earplugs were useless.Fitness centre is amazing, and clearly one of the best that I have been to in a hotel.. It is huge with plenty of cardio options, as well as free weights and weight machines. One complaint I do have about it is that it did not open until 6am (and depended on when security got there to open the door so sometimes a bit later). This was tough as I needed to leave for office at 7:30am so did not give me a lot of time. I understand having a certain opening time when there is trainer there in the gym, but it was only the security man opening it, so not sure why there is not 24 hr access for hotel guests. This would fit in with the business atmosphere of the hotel and would give guests more options.I ate twice at the bar and the food was really good, and the buffet breakfast had loads of choices.I would definitely stay in this hotel again for my next business trip.","September 22, 2018","23    Radisson Blu Hotel & Spa - Istanbul Tuzla

1116,"I'm being very generous with giving it a 3-star despite the horrible service this hotel is offering but it's a 3-star since I did enjoy the hotel itself and it's facilities.As the titles suggests, I wanted a one-night stay before my flight to unwind and relax at the state-of-art spa but I had some flight changes so I had to leave at 9:30PM instead of spending the night so upon my arrival at 12:00, I wanted to make the maximum of the day.The male receptionist did a great job in securing an early check-in and get the whole process done in 5 minutes.Then things started to get worse. I waited in my room for the luggage to arrive so I can get changed and enjoy the facilities.10 minutes later, I called the help desk in which Dalma has confirmed that the bags will be delivered soon. Another 10 minutes have passed and then I called again and this time she lied and said that the bags are already on the way.5 more minutes and I was already fed up. I kept calling several times and they kept ignoring my calls.That was a total of 25 minutes to get my bags into the room in a hotel that isn't even busy!Finally, I went down to the reception to find that my bags are still where I left them and the guy who is supposed to bring them is standing there doing absolutely nothing and is completely free! So, basically Dalma hasn't even informed anybody about my bags and she even lied about it and then she started ignoring me as if I'm asking for something out of this world!I mean come on! What is this?Not only that, Brenda at the reception was extremely cold about it and completely ignored my concerns although I was directing my dialogue to her thinking she was the one who answered me. She even made fun of my comment when I said I will be writing about this since it's an unacceptable behavior from a brand as big as Radisson Blu and this indicates how the management doesn't even care about your reviews and where this hotel is heading.Hotel is nice, food at the resturant is below average and the pools are very enjoyable.I know that having a proper service in Turkey is something not very easy to find but going to a luxury 5-star brand and the hotel is still not being able to deliver is actually a disaster.Come for a day, spend it at the spa pools and leave with the shuttle bus to Sabiha Airport.This hotel offers nothing more.","August 11, 2018","23    Radisson Blu Hotel & Spa - Istanbul Tuzla

I don't mean to sound so British but the queue situation was a bit of a nightmare, people just walk to the front with no respect of others who are waiting. It would be good if the receptionists would take notice of this and call people forward who have been waiting. :)You will need your passport/ID when entering the hotel as it is situated in a highly controlled security area, but we had no problems getting into or out of the hotel and overall I had a pleasant stay there.

1129,"I had multiple stays at this property and I presume to have received an overall exposure.Location: very close to SAW airport and very far from the historical Istanbul downtown (Haga Sophia and Sultanahmet area). No one said it's close by but if you are interested to visit it, it's doable but it takes a long time. It's just a fact to mention at the very beginning.Once you know where it's located, it's a surprise.Nice structure, modern, clean, a bit stylish without excesses (no crystal chandlers or red velvet sofa). I personally like the usage of marble slabs like if it were drapes, quite intriguing to me.Reception: quite friendly and knowledgeable, of course do not expect miracles, you get the room you booked/paid for. Compared to Hilton or SPG/Marriott, the old Carlson Club, nowadays Radisson Rewards program provides no room upgrade, so as I said you get that you booked for. Quite fair I'd say.Elevators: really a lot of them around so never to be afraid of long waiting time (it's important if you are in a rush)Rooms: I never booked suites so I can not speak about them. Normal rooms or business rooms are quite size similar, a bit more differentiating on amenities and the presence of balcony/small terraces.Views: expect to overlook a motorway with all the related traffic/noise. Nothing dramatic, soundproof windows and heavy drapes do a good job and during the night the traffic (& noise) is a lot less. It can happen a room has a not perfect window any more but it's bearable.Restaurant: quite good food and quite open to help (no problem adding and removing ingredients from salads for example). The prices are in line with low-medium business trip, i.e. in line with European dinner budget of mid level employees. If you insist on drinks, the bill will increase a lot accordingly. Two suggestions:a) use the Radisson Rewards program to get a discount (from 5 to 20%)b) ensure you speak with a waiter/Maitre with proper knowledge of English language (it's not a given)SPA:basically half of the ground floor (or basement depending on how you number the floors) is devoted to the gym & spa, and it's free for hotel guest. Magnificent, really magnificent. It's a place to unwind and relax (even taking a nap on the warm red marble wave benches). Two saunas, one steaming room, ice fountain, water dispensers, one full Turkish bath, six Jacuzzi, two swimming pools and lot more. And multiple outdoor cold pool to recover from the sauna heating, well maintained and properly cleaned; if interested you can pay and get profession massages. Towels, bathrobes, linen cloth and slippers are provided free of charge. Only suggestion is to bring the shampoo and body wash from your room, they are of better quality IMHO.

An absolute gem who was so helpful. The rooms were good and the breakfast spread extensive. The location is great as you are in the middle of everything....a short walk to the tram that takes you over the bridge to Sultanahmet, Galata tower is literally on your doorstep with several restaurants in the surrounding area, it's a short (albeit uphill) walk to Istiklal St and Taksim square. The streets around the hotel are a bit grubby but you can see that the area is being transformed and uplifted - don't let this put you off.

1148,"On a recent trip to Istanbul my bff and I opted to stay at Walton Hotel Galata after much research. The hotel may not be the easiest to find but once you do, you will be glad you did.It is close to Galata Tower and Istiklal Street as well as the tram, metro and ferry. This makes it very easy to travel from without using a taxi. However the road between Istiklal and the hotel is a bit quiet at night. The rooms are spacious and neat with comfortable beds and good bathrooms. Being a boutique hotel, it is small so sometimes you can hear other guests in the hallway quite easily.Breakfast at the hotel is adequate. The best part of breakfast is the view - depending on where you sit, you can either look at the Galata Tower or Sultanahmet (Blue Mosque etc). This is the only meal you can have at the restaurant at present.The best part of this hotel is the staff. Fareda and Zeynep were extremely welcoming and helpful throughout our stay. They were willing to give useful advice on how to get around Istanbul, where to shop and what to see and do. Furthermore they provided a transport card which you could just top up and also offered a portable wifi device to hire for a nominal fee. Burak also deserves a mention as he was pleasant and helpful also.P.S.

She was amazing:) the location is close to the tram and close to the galata tower which was great.. And a 15-20 min walk to Taksim. The hotel is in a small street which makes it a little bit more difficult for taxis to find, but you can give the taxi driver the number of the hotel and they'll call them for instructions. The breakfast was alright, we didn't really care much for the breakfast as there are many great restaurants close by. The hotel's design is adorable . The rooms were very clean and the beds were super comfortable. The restaurant on the roof has a nice view and a great vibe.We grabbed a small bite to eat for dinner there and everything was delicious. The hotel has many offers for tours. We opted for the tour with a cruise of the Bosphorus, Dolmabahce palace, Maiden tower, Pierre lotti and cable car, and the receptionist called the tour for us and booked everything and even got us a small discount, it was a great value for the price :) Everything was great and thanks to all the staff for making our stay great :)","August 19, 2018","24    Walton Hotels Galata

1160,"We travel extensively and have stayed in hotels all over the world, never have i come across such terrible booking process. The hotel cancelled my booking 1 day before my arrival. I spent hours on the phone with both booking.com and the hotel direct- calling them from the UK. Apparently, they could not charge my credit card with the details provided on the booking.com website. I checked with my bank and booking.com (who tried charging my card to check) and both confirmed there was no issue with my credit card account and i had sufficient funds. having cancelled my booking twice- the hotel then changed the room rate (the last remaining room for that night) from the £61 i booked to £532 for the same night! They refused any alternative i offered including giving my car details on the phone to their reservation department or paying on arrival- they would not accept any solution and left me with no booking and having to find alternative accommodation the night before. If you want a hassle free stay in this fabulous city and not worry about being left with no accommodation the night before -just so the hotel can inflate their price- AVOID!","July 5, 2018","24    Walton Hotels Galata

1161,"I was captured by the photos on the Hotel website and more so after reading the reviews. Sadly the photos didn’t meet the expectation. The hotel was clearly a cool place several years ago. Now it’s severely run down and far from being a boutique hotel. My room had dust all over, a clothes tag in the card slot, the mirror had toothpaste splash all over, and the air con had the most horrendous rattling sound. After my complaints the receptionist moved me to another room which was more silent but still fat from ideal: marks on the wall from the door and toilet seats, dust on the skirting boards from a drill holes. I’mnot the kind who complains often but this hotel have stretched their definition of boutique hotel. I won’t even mention how hard it is to find the hotel.

1167,"I recently spent three nights here with my husband. We have visited Istanbul several times and Galata is one of our favorite locations for accommodation. The Walton hotel is close to Galata tower so very conveniently located but in a back street with no view. A bit depressing but I guess it makes for a quiet stay. The breakfast is very basic: all the extra charges (including for orange juice, in Turkey!) have to be paid in cash, so no ability to put anything on the room. The lobby is tiny and there is no atmosphere at all. If you are looking for a room and nothing else, this place will do. It is clean and well located. But there is no service of any kind (including no one around to make TV work) so I do not think we will stay here again.","March 14, 2018","24    Walton Hotels Galata

We were able to check in early, we arrived at 7.30am off a long-haul flight from Bangkok so were naturally very tired and were expecting to have to wait till 3pm but both rooms were available straight away. Reception area was very comfortable with large sofas and the receptionist always greeted us with a smile and asked how we were finding Istanbul.The hotel also offered free mobile phone which could be used as a hot spot when you were exploring or in the room for faster internet. This was a great service offered and meant that we could use Google Maps to help find our way around the city. The rooms were comfy with free tea and coffee making facilities, there was a Nespresso machine in mine however I never used it. Bathroom was also good with good quality shower and shampoo and soap provided. The restaurant upstairs was lovely with gorgeous views of Istanbul both in the morning and in the evening. We ate breakfast up there every day and was constantly getting the tea topped up which was good. The dinner was also very tasty and with drinks prices that were very reasonable and compariable to Istanbul and the Galata area.I would have no issues about returning to this hotel and for a city centre hotel it ticks all the boxes.","September 16, 2017","24    Walton Hotels Galata

1173,"Bit of a mixed stay, normally I would give this 3 stars but due to some of their nice touches, hard not to give them 4. Why mixed? Well of the 5 nights I stayed, 2 of them were certainly not peaceful. The 1st night I arrived at the hotel around 8pm with a pretty bad headache. The check in was great, the gentleman sat me down with the welcome box which included a phone/wifi hot spot and map, and spent a few minutes with me talking about where things were in the local area etc. However not long after I got to my room, some repair work started going on outside, a pneumatic drill, and carried on for a few hours. With the buildings all being tall and close together, the sound travels upwards and boy oh boy was it loud. After an hour I did reluctantly call reception and ask what was happening, and to their credit they had already spoken to the repair guys and said it wouldn’t go on too much longer. Unfortunately it did, but not much the hotel can do about that beyond what they tired.And one of the other nights there was some sort of party/event going on up on the top floor above us. This again was quite loud, however reception were actually proactive and called me to say the event is going on, we could move rooms if it was too loud and invited us to join. That was a nice touch and it is good the hotel is making an effort to put on such events, but quiet would also have been nice. I think it stopped around 1am, so thankfully we were able to sleep….until 3:45am when table and chairs started to be dragged backwards and forwards on the floor (our ceiling). At this point I was pretty annoyed and called reception who were not aware that anyone would be doing anything at that time, but said they would call up and tell them to stop, which it did after about 10 mins. Overall not a great nights sleep.The positives? Well as above, being given the time and having the local area and sites explained plus being able to have internet when outside of the hotel was invaluable! No hotel I’ve been to has provided this before, and it was really excellent to be able to use google maps to find where we were in relation to what we wanted to see.The location of the hotel was great. As others have said, it is in quite a built up area but you can cross over the bridge to get to most the main tourist attractions, or head up the hill to the main shopping street with many food options and shops. It really is in a brilliant location to walk to most things.The room was also very pleasant, nice design and a good bathroom. Bed was very comfy, and it was well cleaned, so all good here. Breakfast was so so, a small section of things but wasn’t very filling. The hotel staff were all very friendly and most helpful, and it was a much more personal service than you would receive in a larger hotel. Therefore if you need a base to explore Istanbul for a short trip the hotel would be a great option at a very good price.","June 27, 2017","24    Walton Hotels Galata

1191,"My husband and I stayed at Artefes Hotel from 8 to 12 June 2019. On arrival and throughout our stay, we found the staff to be friendly and helpful.However, despite booking a room with double or queen size bed, we were given a room with two single beds. Furthermore, the rooms are extremely basic and cheaply furnished - although clean. Nothing is tasteful or attractive about the decor and the color palette is drab and boring.Maintenance is poor. For example: the door frame on the inside of the bathroom is missing. I'm sure its been this way for a long, long time. In the drawer next to the bed are sawn off pieces of wood. This shows that the cleaning service either does not dust inside the drawers and/or are too lazy to remove these and throw them away. The safe in our cheaply built wardrobe was not bolted to the wall. So while we could store our valuables in the safe - anybody could have just picked up the safe and walked off with it. Why has this not been attended to? Does housekeeping not report this kind of thing?The bathroom looked like it had been redecorated somewhere in the not-so-distant past. However, again, it lacks taste and is not practical. Other than a space measuring about 8cm x 5cm on the tiny hand basin - there is not a single place in the bathroom or shower where you can put down a hair brush, a vanity bag or anything else of a personal nature. One gets the idea that the ""free"" soap, shampoo, body wash and slippers provided in the room is from the cheapest of cheap supplier that Management could find.There are no amenities (as advertised). So do not expect a find a steam room, massage room, gym and/or restaurant at which to dine from (or whatever else they claim to provide).Breakfast is downright awful !!!!! From dried out pieces of bread, to dried out cheeses, to wilted sliced tomatoes, to overcooked boiled eggs that nobody eats and (I suspect) are re-served the following day(s) as well, to dried out cake, loads of olives in every color - served whole and diced, to unappetizing cereal and jam so colorless, thin and watery that it just runs off your dry piece of bread ....... this is what you have to look forward to.Then they have cheek to put out a wooden box with the word ""Tips"" stuck to it.In 2016, this hotel won 3 or 4 awards - I ""think"" from Trip Advisor - for what, I'm not sure. If this was the case, it is sad to see what it offers now and we can only suspect that matters have seriously degenerated since 2016.As stated in my opening paragraph, the staff are friendly and helpful. However, this does not translate into effort, pride or excellence. Instead, there is a distinct air of lethargy and having 'given up' and 'stopped trying'. Alternatively, they are under an illusion if they truly believe that what they are offering, is good. They should really seek the advice of experienced hoteliers / consultants to up their game.While we were here, there was building work going on in the basement. So we had to put up with loud drilling and knocking that went on till approx 8pm at night.I had wanted to book out of Artefes and stay somewhere else. But as we had prepaid for our accommodation - we thought that we might not get a refund of our money. And since the room / hotel was, at least, clean - we stayed on and put up with the misery of everything else.What Artefes does have in its favor is its location - which is extremely good - as it is within 5 to 20 minutes walk of all major tourist attractions, such as: Blue Mosque, Hagia Sofia, Bascillica Cistern, Grand Bazaar, Spice Bazaar, Galatta Bridge, etc.However, you will find much nicer hotels to stay at in the area, within the same walking distances of the same tourist attractions.TIP: We found a lovely restaurant just across the road from Artefes - called Marbella, and chose to eat our dinner here every night. We enjoyed uninterrupTed views over the ocean from this restaurant and thoroughly enjoyed our flavor filled meals here.","June 20, 2019","25    Artefes Hotel Istanbul

Nothing like the pictures they present - they didn't want to give us our money back, but they offer another room - terrible noise starting at 9 a.m. ending in the evening because they were renovating some rooms - the rooms for massage, sauna and baths were not finished","May 27, 2019","25    Artefes Hotel Istanbul

1194,"This hotel is at walking distance from the Hagia Sophia and other important attractions, which is definitely the big advantage.However, it goes downhill from there. Have your cell phone handy if you want to call the reception, because neither of the two phones worked in the room. Good luck taking a shower in the morning with sporadic interruptions of hot water. Also, make sure you inspect your towels before taking a shower, you might find marks you don't like. There are a lot of boutique hotels around this place, I'd recommend looking for one with not so many problems. ","November 24, 2018","25    Artefes Hotel Istanbul

But more than anything, the staff went above and beyond to help me with every enquiry and issue I had - bookings, transfers, even helped by personally coming to the bank with me when I panicked because the cash machine “retained” my card just an hour before my flight!I have no reason to look anywhere else beyond this hotel for accommodation in Istanbul!

1209,"I booked this hotel on booking.com for 12 nights. Istanbul is great to travel to during winter because it is Very cheap. I got a great deal. About $660. About 7 hours into the booking I ask for cancellation. Apparently it's their policy not to have bookings cancelled.I called the property and asked, I barely got anyone speaking English. They still refused to cancel. I said, OK - will try it out and see. What's the worst that could happen. They debuted MY card almost as soon as I made the booking. The hotels ratings are very good for location. The reviews are not so quite. So I get there and check in. I ask for a tour after being taken to my room. Deck, and then I ask for the gym. It's in the basement I am told. We go there. And it's like a scrap place. Dark. No lights but it's also suffocating. Not aerated at all. There was only a treadmill which looked run down. Doubt it would have worked. My room, dark, cold, no tea or coffee.Hotel only makes breakfast. No food - had been on a 9hour flight. I couldn't get myself to even use the bathroom. My room had a lot of noise from outside, so I decide to close the windows. Mold and rust met me, and I was petrified. I immediately checked out. And found another hotel. This is not a hotel, but an Inn or GuestHouse. The gym is very dilapidated. Have staff that barely speak English. Only thing they have going for them is location but even then, nah.

It took the staff about 30/40 mins to try and fix the bathroom issue and advised us to just leave it for today and they will try to fix it tomorrow or move us to another room (which was not as nice as the one we paid for). Totally unreasonable for us to do this as we paid for a bedroom with functioning bathroom so said we would not want to pay for that room that night if the bathroom could not be fixed which they didnt agree with - in the end the issue was fixed. However, later on had another issue as the toilet would not flush.There was no kettle or tea making facilities in room so we went to the restaurant as there was boiling water and tea bags here and was told we could not use them to make tea? Never had this before.The breakfast was medicore and would have to continually ask for things as they would not provide them.When we booked the room we were told we would get free hammam, but at the hotel they said the hammam hadn't worked for a long time - why was this offer still on their own website then?Some staff were friendly and helped with issues but the hotel itself needs renovationLocation was good, 10 min walk from blue mosuqe/sultanahmet tram.

The facade of the hotel is a welcoming sight, staff is helpful albeit less cheerful. The room was not something to rave about especially when the portion of the floor creaks with every step you take. The big disappointment is the shower. Let's just say that the hotel would have been better off if they supplied the room with a bucket and a container to manually pour water and get the feeling of ""showering"".

1230,"We spent 5 days here and overall had a good experience. It's definitely worth it for the price-the location is really great (about 15 minutes walk from Sultanahmet station and the Hagia Sophia and 5 minutes from the little Hagia Sophia but definitely hard to find the first time) and the hotel is clean. The breakfast buffet is very good (although it's the same everyday so could potentially get tiring for long stays) but some of the things (like the eggs) don't get replaced as they run out so going first thing is probably best. The view of the Sea of Marmara from the rooftop is lovely. The wifi was also fairly good. There are restaurants (although pricier than elsewhere in the city) all around and a few grocery and corner stores if you just wander a bit farther out (within a 10 min walk max). I see reviews that housekeeping wasn't good but that wasn't my experience at all. Checking out was easy and they let us leave our bags for a few hours by the front desk. We also ended up going with a shuttle back to the airport due to an injury and they arranged it quickly and the price was comparable to what we saw at the travel agencies while we were wandering around (20TL each).My only complaints are that the bed wasn't super comfortable. I could feel the springs but it definitely wasn't terrible and my boyfriend didn't even notice. The other negative was just how much noise came in from outside. We were in a room facing the playground right outside and for the most part that was okay because no one was there late at night or early in the morning but the sound of the call to prayer was very loud coming from closeby outside and woke me up almost every day we were there. Finally, the hotel overcharged our credit card 20TL when we booked online and it all got sorted out but it was a bit of a process. It started off well with them taking the initiative to inform us that we had been overcharged but they said they could not refund our credit card and instead would offer us two uses of the hamam in the hotel which was a greater value. I thought it was a bit weird that they said they couldn't just put it back on our card but I decided to wait until we got there to ask about it. I brought it up when we checked out and was told it had already been put back on our credit card. When we got back I looked it up and it had not been. I emailed them and they took care of it right away but if I hadn't double checked I wouldn't have gotten it back. Overall though it did get sorted out and wasn't that big of a deal.","June 1, 2016","25    Artefes Hotel Istanbul

Our triple room consisted of 3 single beds in a room barely big enough to fit a queen size bed in We were the only people staying in the hotel at the time we stayed, so this must have been the biggest triple room available. The rooms are clean and neat. Breakfast on the first morning was exceptional. Second morning we were told there was no buffet as we were the only people staying in the hotel. Third morning, the buffet returned, though perishables somewhat aged. Fourth morning we left early and asked for an early breakfast, which was provided (similar to second morning breakfast) which we were grateful for. Breakfast room staff and concierge provided great service. Rooftop terrace is lovely and since we were only people in hotel, enjoyed the views on our own.

1237,"We stayed 1 nigth at the Artefes on arrival and were greeted by very friendly staff and then stayed again after our cruise for 4 nights. The rooms are not massive but they are very nice, the open windows allow the breeze in if it's not too hot and in our second room we had a lovely corner window. It was wonderful to sit by the window and read in the evening before heading to super or in the early morning, you could look out on the street below, which was quiet most of the time.During the dinner hour there is more traffic some days but the street is small so doesn't invite a lot of heavy traffic.It's just a 10-15 minute walk from the hotel to the heart of Sultanhamet, with the Blue Mosque, Aya Sofya and a short distance further is Topkapi.There is a small Bazaar on the way and many shops and restaurants to try local food or purchase local products.We quickly learned our way around and felt very comfortable in the area.They have a great roof terrace where you can sit with your breakfast or if you want to bring a late snack up. It's a great place to take pictures.The breakfast room is nice and clean the food is a combination of salads, very good bread, hard boiled eggs, scrambled eggs, cheeses, cereal with jams and honey for your toast with tea and coffee to drink.It is an older hotel so don't expect massive quantities of modern furniture. It is a good place to stay for the money.The wifi was excellent, never had any problems getting on and it was fast.","October 28, 2015","25    Artefes Hotel Istanbul

1240,"The first time I was a guest of Artefes Hotel was in 2004. My most recent stay was September 2015 - my 8th visit in a series of visitations spanning a decade. I think this fact alone, speaks volumes for my thoughts of the beautiful boutique hotel in the heart of the historical peninsula, that is the very heart of Istanbul. However, I believe are a few more things worth noting about this hotel...I live in Australia and travel to Turkey on a regular basis. i am yet to find another hotel that rivals this wonderful home away from home. First and foremost, its centrally located within Sultanahmet and its a matter of 5 minutes walk to reach a point of public transport that will tie in with any other location in the city. Secondly, it is simply the very heart of the historic peninsula - even if you're only planning to stay for no more than a few days in Istanbul, the vicinity of the hotel is a gold mine in terms of tourist attractions and history - all within walking distance. Third, its 20 minutes to the international airport, so distance is never an issue when travelling to and from your point of stay. Fourth, the hotel is well maintained, with modern amenities and will not fail on hygienic grounds. Fifth, the staff are tourism professionals personified - they are extremely courteous and helpful. In terms of the included buffet breakfast - a review can be dedicated to this point alone. Think of all the possible breakfast items that a hotel can offer you to provide the energy you need for a touristic up and go - you'll find it waiting for you every morning, prepared at the top floor dining hall with nice large windows for an early morning glimpse into Istanbul - full sight of Sultanahmet mosque and the Sea of Marmara.Over the years, I have stayed in various other hotels, however I have not found the same level of excellence in comfort and all that one can expect from a hotel, as I have in Artefes Hotel. I have experienced the feeling of being at home away from home 8 times, without fail, over the last 10 years of my visit to Istanbul. I plan on visiting Istanbul again in the near future, and when I do, I will not be going through a list of hotels in the heart of the city. I feel fortunate in having found what I consider to be the best boutique hotel in the city.","September 26, 2015","25    Artefes Hotel Istanbul

1241,"This hotel was a very pleasant surprise. Situated I next to the Blue Mosque on the old town this is the perfect place as a home base for exploring Istanbul and all of its fantstisk places. We actually wanted to stay at a 5 star hotel, but found this through friends who had stayed there. And we were not disappointed . The hotel is clean, cosy and has everything to cater your needs. The staff is super friendly and will go the extra mile to fulfill your requests. In the basement you will find a steam room, sauna, exercise room and even a full fledged hamam all free of charge. When you get back from a hard day of touristing and shopping you can get a massage from a skilled masseuse. The hotel has a superb roof terrace overlooking the Bosphorus straight on the one side and the old city and the Blue Mosque on the other. If you want something special you should book the Suite on the top floor. It has it own terrace overlooking the Bosperous Straight, Jaccusi and is convienently situated next to the breakfast restaurant, which means that you can just slip out of bed, go pick up your breakfast and coffie and enjoy it on you own terrace.The manager Vedat Aydın will makes sure that you have a pleasent stay...

1242,"If you are looking for a relatively inexpensive suite room look no more. A modestly designed, albeit a bit funky, room was more than adequate for our 6 day stay in Istanbul from 27 August to 2September. Just remember the sofa bed isn't quite the size for an adult. There were only 2 of us cousins and we were happy sharing the king which was more like a queen size American style. Close by within walking distance are Aghia Sofia, Blue Mosque, Topkapi. Many small restaurants, and a very nice shopping bazaar (better than the overwhelming Grand Bazaar) are also within walking distance. The fellows running the front desk were particularly helpful with local information and the staff was courteous and friendly.If you are adverse to the sounds of the call to prayer please note this happens several times day and evening and being so close to the Blue Mosque, you may want to stay a little further away. Also there is some construction going on daytime across the way, cutting out some of the view from the suite's balcony. These 2 things did not bother us and we slept through the 5am call to prayer each morning.","September 10, 2015","25    Artefes Hotel Istanbul

1244,"Having been directed by Trip Advisor I have just read the hotel`s response to my review. The whole manner of it reflects the unpleasant attitude we experienced at this hotel. With relation to the points they made, we were a party of two adults, a toddler and a baby. Why would we need or want two rooms? Nor did we have a guest in our room. Also the exaggerated claims that fresh bedding etc had to be purchased are defamatory. We have been regular visitors to Istanbul for nearly a decade and have never met with anything but friendliness and excellent hospitality, never has there been any complaints regarding us as guests until we had the misfortune to book this hotel. (a last minute booking).The worst part of our stay at the hotel, which I was too distressed to mention in my original review, was when a member of staff called the little two year old girl ""A freak."" having seen her rocking in her push chair. Her mother had just died!! How cruel and insensitive can you get to a grieving small child.","August 2, 2015","25    Artefes Hotel Istanbul

1245,"The location of the hotel is great! There's a bus stop just in front in case you get to Ağva by public transportation from Istanbul. Moreover, it is along one of the rivers and only 20 minutes walking from the center and the other riverside.The reception was very useful and they take their time to treat you very well and giving you useful information from the surroundings. They go with you to the room and they take care a lot of clients even at the check out. 10/10We took the bungalow room and it is exactly as you expect. Wooden building with balcony and views to a green garden, with a complete bathroom and amenities. Very cozy!!The restaurant is just stunning next to the river with a very nice terrasse. Even the service was not that much professional, the food was average but it worths spending time there because of the atmosphere and views.The breakfast was the typical Turkish one and it was a good one, they even ask you on which way you want to have the egg cooked. Appreciate it!The relation price/quality is very good. It may be a bit more expensive than other accommodations in Ağva but it really worths staying in Robin's nest.By the way, wifi did not work in the room, just only by the reception, but it was so cozy, pleasant and peaceful that we did not mind.

1246,"Hey, this is Harry. When my dad offered me the chance to write a comment about our stay at Robin's Nest in Ağva, I thought, why not, and decided to give it a shot.I am here for 5 days now with mom, dad and my elder sister Yeşil (No, I am not a catophobic!) It is winter time, so we are not able to stay out too long but I stick to my routine man walkings. Since the nature and environment is wild and beautiful here I take my mom and dad out at least twice a day.The weather is crazy but that don't stop us from joining all kinds of activities. Mom and dad took a boat trip on the river which runs by our hotel. They also visited a nearby bay called Kilimli that they thought was fantastic. I took my first canoeing lesson on the garden and I liked it. On one of our night walks, we came across gendarme, they started to run for us because they thought I am with the 'Yellow Jackets'. Boy, that was weird!My usual diet is coupled with fish and meatballs at Robin's Nest which I find pretty delicious. I heard my mom agree about the quality of food. But she also said that the menu can get a bit boring after a few days. She says some daily dishes would add value to our stay and dad nodded. Still we are all very happy to have fish every day and trust me, love for eating fish may be the only common pleasure amongst the members of this family.As for the rooms, we are staying in a Comfort Room. It is clean, comfortable and peaceful. We have huge windows with a beautiful view of the river. Yeşil is especially happy with this as she is a moody, lazy soul and she definitely needs an opening to life's pleasures that she can enjoy without moving her legs.My mom says some simple features are missing and that makes some simple activities a bit difficult. Like hanging my wet raincoat to dry as the room doesn't have enough hangers. She also said that we could have used some more of shelves and drawers and dad nodded (yeah, that's what he does). Also, we only have a fixed shower head and every time I need my legs washed I have to go thru a full body shower. So I guess they can work a bit more on these things in the room.The hotel is 'animal friendly' even though I don't find this expression especially friendly. The chow chow I met on the first day was cool but he said 'ciao! ciao!' very early and left. So I stuck with this blonde cat and the grey cat and my folks keep feeding them as if there's no tomorrow but come tomorrow, I will get them for diner for sure.The staff: I don't see them much often as it is forbidden for me to enter public spaces. But every time I hear my folks talking about asking for some more towels and other stuff, someone shows up at the door in a minute with a smile on his face and never forgets to blink at me. They are doing their best and we really like them.All in all, our stay at Robin's Nest in Ağva has been a pleasure. In fact, I can't wait to come back here especially for the Irish cutie living on the other side of the river.Sincerely, Harry.","December 26, 2018","26    Robin's Nest

1247,"Robin's Nest is a charming, quaint place. Very country style and food is of good quality. It's a place of peace and tranquility and if you are into photography, this place won't disappoint you.Having said that, don't choose to stay at the bungalow. It's all made of wood and the room is very basic and simple that you won't even find a full length mirror. It feels like you are staying in a sauna. You can also hear every single footstep of the upstairs' guest and it's impossible to sleep because of the noise. The wooden ceiling would creak at every pressure. Bathroom wasn't exactly pleasant. Shower area has rusty bit and does look gross and unsightly. For over 400tl per night, I guess I expected more. Perhaps if management does some renovation to better the room and bathroom, it will make guests alot more satisfied and pleased.Staff are nice and lovely though and people in Agva are really nice and sweet.","November 4, 2018","26    Robin's Nest

1255,Came here with my girlfriend for a small getaway. The pictures online look really nice and the premises look pretty. Its right off the road but it has nice greenery and trees. It's right next to a small river but the river looks really muddy due to recent rains we were told so we didn't end up going kayaking (a friend of ours went there a month before and it looked the same even tho it didn't rain). The room was disappointing. It was clean but had no mini fridge and we reserved a double bed which ended up being two singles put together. Not comfortable at all to sleep in as a couple. The poor service came from asking the staff to cool a bottle of wine for us as there is no mini fridge. They refused to do it and began talking of a service charge for the possibility of doing that. We ended up going to a restaurant in town and the wine cooled off while we had dinner. ,"August 5, 2017","26    Robin's Nest

We were meant to drive back to Istanbul, but the hotel let us stay to warm up and lit a large, pre-laid fire for us, so we got warm, dried off, and had an excellent lunch by the raging fire.We will return to the Robin's Nest, many times I am sure!","August 19, 2016","26    Robin's Nest

The highlights are eating on the porch overhanging the water and swimming in the large and spotless pool. The rooms are clean with wood paneling and balconies . Request one on the river side not the road. It is a long walk or short drive to town. A shorter walk to the beach. The service was extremely friendly but certain aspects that I found charmingly reminiscent of hotels 20 years ago, might not appeal to everyone. The large menu only had about one quarter of the items listed. The bar has all kinds of special drinks but only one or two bottles of wine from the list of about a dozen and those were on the verge of turning. There is tea all day but it was hard to get something cold to drink at the pool in very hot weather. Our room was not serviced. The kayak is really old and beat up. Same with the fishing equipment. Breakfast supposedly started at 8 but by 8:30 not much was out-no bread yet. Sitting overlooking the beautiful river, I could easily take a deep breath and wait for the cheerful and willing staff to bumble around and get it pretty much right in the end. I loved the natural setting and old fashioned charm. No package tours, no disco and as far as I could tell, very few foreign tourists. All pluses for us. ","July 14, 2016","26    Robin's Nest

1262,"I chose Robin's Nest as the venue to host a group workshop for 20 people from around the world - Africa, Asia, North America, and Pacific. I wanted somewhere peaceful and comfortable, where we could focus for a week of intensive group meetings, and in a location that had accessible, friendly local places to explore but not overwhelming like a big city.I found the town of Agva on a recommendation of a Turkish friend, who suggested it as a place that many people from Istanbul visit when they want a peaceful, nature retreat from the city.I was very impressed by Robin's Nest because the manager, Bahar, was so responsive and addressed all my questions and requests easily and in a personalized way. Bahar prepared a package for our group that included all accommodation, meals, meeting room, activities, and even all the transfers for getting everyone to and from the Ataturk airport (including greeter service at the airport). The package was a great deal and saved me a lot of logistical work, especially because I do not understand Turkish.From when we arrived at the airport, to being received at the hotel, to every meal, and every interaction with staff, the team at Robin's Nest made us feel very welcome and took care of our every need. The meals are absolutely delicious and bountiful - full of fresh, local produce and fish - and all of our participants enjoyed the food (not an easy feat with an international group!). The large dining room is very comfortable and great for meal time conversations, and the outside deck by the river is fabulous for large group lunches or enjoying the pleasant weather.The conference/meeting room is a real highlight of the hotel. It is one large open room, in its own separate building, with lots of wood, stone, and warm light. The fireplace heats the room very comfortably on cooler days, and the windows can all open up for a refreshing breeze. The acoustics are great, the room can be rearranged for a large group in various set-ups, and there are small tables and couches for break-out groups, as well as spaces outside for small groups. The room has a great projector and screen, sound system, and Bahar set it up with flipcharts, markers, notebooks, and even a printer for us to use. Fantastic! We even converted the room to a dance floor for our final night's party.The rooms themselves are comfortable but fairly small. Since we booked each participant into their own room that was not a problem, but if you wanted to have more than one person share a room, be prepared that they would be sharing small rooms. Each room has its own bathroom and balcony. The wireless internet worked well. Sound does carry between rooms a little, but Bahar told us that they are updating all the rooms to improve the separation.The town of Agva is wonderful - very cute and fun to stroll around. It is a small, beach-side fishing town, surrounded by green forest hills and farmland. There are very pleasant routes to walk through the town from Robin's Nest and trails up into the forests - be sure to ask Bahar and her team for suggestions and a map. I cannot say enough of how amazing Bahar and her team were for our group - they are a really wonderful team and make you feel like you've joined their big family while you stay there. I absolutely recommend this as a venue for group workshops or small conferences or a relaxing vacation too - I and the whole group, hope that we can return again for a future workshop. Thank you Robin's Nest team!","December 4, 2015","26    Robin's Nest

1263,"From my observations, this hotel is probably one of the best choices available in the area. Do not expect high quality furnitures as this is not a luxury hotel. The service both at the reception and the restaurant was very good. In terms of cleanliness, my room was rather clean (although could be better). The hotel is well located and very calm in fall. I would strongly recommend taking the trekking path at Kilimli bay.","November 30, 2015","26    Robin's Nest

1265,"Driving to Agva at mid night I get tired and take to room at Robin's Nest Situated by Goksu River, the place surrounded by a beautiful green garden. It offers accommodation with air conditioning, and a beautiful area on the side of Goksu River. Regardless of quantity and quality of breakfast it is worth to have breakfast in the river side. For those who are traveling by car I should say that there is an open air parking at the yard and the car can be parked in the side of street. About the Cleanliness, it was fair. Comfort as a whole was fair .in the mater of Value for money it is not bad. Location was in the heart of river and very present after a long drive. Comfort of bed was fair but because I was tired of driving I sleep whole the night unconsciousness .Free Breakfast but not a variety of food. The staff was polite and helping. The atmosphere was beautiful . The services (WC & bath) were not as good as the other place like that. The room was very humid and smells unwillingly. The sound of car passing by maybe annoying. But if you don’t reserve a room before passing through a town, you can not expect any better! If you want to stay there it is better to take room in river side rather than rode side.","August 3, 2015","26    Robin's Nest

1266,"We'd previously enjoyed a great trip to Istanbul and this time we wanted to experience a coastal resort within a few hours drive from the city. From the start we had a memorable experience. The hotel with its big grounds was on the banks of the river and we ate all our meals on a lovely terrace with views of wildlife and gentle river traffic (eg canoes). The surrounding area is beautiful - the wide sandy beach is just a 5 minute walk away and immediately next to the hotel are some easy walks you can do on lanes through the forest. On one walk we found a wild tortoise which the kids loved seeing. The hotel also offered free use of fishing gear and a canoe and on one trip we saw wild turtles and lots of bird life. One of the highlights was the food in the hotel. We stayed half board and the breakfast and dinner were delicious and filling - dinner consisted of five delicious courses each evening and the buffet breakfast was also excellent. But perhaps the most memorable part of the stay was the kindness and friendliness of the hotel staff - in particular Bahar, the owner, and Abdullah, the head waiter. They both spoke faultless English and could not do enough to help us. Seriously, it was service that really stood out. I would 100% recommend this charming family-run hotel to other people who want to see a beautiful part of Turkey just a short drive from Istanbul.","July 18, 2015","26    Robin's Nest

1275,"i booked the room through a website just a few days before my trip. two things that attracted me to the hotel is how close the hotel to 3 main places of interest and the price. The photos looked good and they have a terrace overlooking the sea and a beautiful mosque.Once arrived at the airport, I hired a taxi. I believe the driver was cursing in his head while driving back and forth in middle of no where at Sultanahmet area. After a lot of struggles, at last we found the hotel. The signboard is the tiniest hotel signboard i have ever seen. No wonder our driver had hard time to find it and it located at an alley.Ok, then we were welcomed by one of the staff. Apparently I was 30 minutes early from the official check in time so we decided to drop our bag and went out for lunch. There were restaurants nearby but the area was at terrain, be prepared to climb back to hotel.The reception area was decent looking. we received our key and our bags were brought up. There was no elevator. So for those who has bad knee, you might find that ascending the staircase is not your cup of tea.How's the room..? It was never in my expectation. the curtains were torn, the floor border was broken, there were no towel (at first), i have to request the towels from a lady who I assumed the cleaner (she cannot speak english, but we communicated like chicken and duck). The room was heated. The cupboard was an antique. The room faces an abandoned building..so tips to others, please choose room with view (the view is nice). Too tired and jet lagged, we just do not bother to complain and urgently need a nap.Since we were out most of the time, we do not spend much time in the room. Sleep quality was ok. The attendant at night was much politer compared to the day shift attendant. If you want hot tea, the attendant was available to prepare it.Breakfast was 10 lira per pax. We chose to sit at the terrace which had the sea view.They prepared some cheese, olives, boiled egg, cereal, bread, etc..not much but ok. The cafe located at the lower ground and you have to go through staircases and some ongoing renovation work.From the hotel to Blue Mosque is around 400m walk..in terms of radius it just 200m. The hotel can arrange airport shuttle which cost 10 euro per pax. there was free wifi at the hotel. From Atarturk Airport is 30 minutes drive, while from Sabiha Airport is two hours.","April 6, 2018","27    Hotel Tulip House

After a bit lost to get to hotel since it wasn’t in the main road we didn’t know if hotel was close because you can’t see front desk from outside. Staff that was at lobby were very friendly, in fact the only good thing on this hotel. After a quick explanation they took us to the room which for my surprise it was totally different than the trip advisor pictures. This room was a total mess, first thing I noticed was 2 towel with holes and stains. It was like a joke, I was ready to look for the hidden camera. I couldn’t believe what I was seeing, nothing compare with what all people talk about in the reviews or how the room look on the internet. I was so embarrassed with my mom because it was a special day for her but you could tell in her face how frustrated and disgusted she was with the room. Beside stains in the towel bed also had stains, broken cabinet, ugly curtains with no covers to stop the light to get into the room, bathroom was average as the shower faucet was also broken so water was going all directions. On top all this issues you could hear everything from your neighbors, even if they are sneezing. This place was near everything indeed but it’s a shame the room didn’t help it.

And second they guy who runs or at least who was running the hotel today is a really bad person really agressive, since we got there he made us feel not welcome at all, then The first thing he said was the room you booked is three floors down but I can give you a better room for just 5 euros more per night, So we said no it's ok. He insisted and led us up to see the new room which was all dirty and still messy at 3p.m. So we told this kid to show us The room we previously booked, and actually was better than the one he was trying to get us charging more, but im not saying was good that place is not good at all. So we ""decided to take it"" anyway. When we came down to tell him he turned really agressive saying we could not, because he did not want to get any complaint and we said not it's fine, better than the other you offered; we ended up in a dicussion being told stupids just because we wanted to take then room we booked. ofc, we left right away and fortunately they did not take our credit card, he just got the copy of our passports.

One of the ""fresh"" bath towels had a small blood stain and hair on it. The little bottles of shampoo (?), conditioner (?) and soap (?) were unlabelled and none of the staff knew which was which. We were there for two nights and on the first night at about 10 pm, we were in bed and heard a key in the lock. Before we could get out of bed, the door opened and a male staff person looked in, to which we said ""excuse me!? we're in this room!"" and with a murmur he closed the door, apparently unaware we were booked in the room? Creepy and unnerving. The shower doors were stiff and hard to open and close, and the shower rod supporting the handheld shower was not properly attached to the wall. Our stay wasn't a disaster, but certainly not of the minimum standards we would expect. Not angry, but certainly disappointed.","October 7, 2015","27    Hotel Tulip House

1299,"I booked a room with a king bed in this hotel on booking.com with a fairly good price and I was very happy and excited to get there with my boyfriend to spend the best vacation ever! Unfortunately, that turned out not to be the case. First, they told us that we need to pay additional fees if we wanted to have a second person in a room that is obviously for two people. After I contested this additional fees, they told me that we cannot even stay as two unmarried people in the same room anyways, because it was not a decent thing. I wanted them to cancel the room, and in fact started begging, but they could not care less. After all this ordeal, they have already taken out the money for the hotel room that they obviously are not going to let me in. Thanks for ruining my one vacation this year even before getting there. Avoid this place at all costs.","August 30, 2015","27    Hotel Tulip House

Azim was incredibly helpful with where to go, what to see and how to get there. Breakfast was lovely on a small outside area. The hotel is within walking distance from the Blue Mosque and many restaurants, although quite steep - pulling luggage is not an option! We took a taxi from the airport which cost 45 TL as opposed to the 25 Euro pick-up service that the hotel email offered beforehand. The terrace has fantastic views over the Marmaris Sea but the furniture is scant up there, got to get there first to get a seat.....we had our own sundowners there every night.

1302,"I stayed here for four nights in July. The gentleman who checked me in said he was ""upgrading"" me to a sea view room. The room did have a balcony with a nice view of the sea. However I cannot imagine a smaller room. There was barely room to walk around the bed to get to the closet. The bathroom was very tiny and the shower had only a hand held shower wand that did not spray directly down--you had to hold it and spray water on yourself. The shower was also dirty, with black mold in the tile. The service here is also very uneven. Some of the people who work here are friendly and want to be helpful. Others seem bothered by a guest's questions or a request for tea. Even the nice ones cannot get you what you need. There were several bulbs out in my room including the one over the bed that serves as a reading light. I asked if they could be replaced but that never happened. I asked for more hangers - never appeared (I had maybe four in the closet.) There was only one thin, scratchy blanket on the bed and no top sheet. The man at the desk during the day watched tv and talked to friends on the phone and seemed like I was annoying him when I approached for assistance. When I needed to buy a train ticket for the next part of my journey, he did not know anything about buying tickets and showed no interest in helping me figure out where to go. I had a second reservation here for a few days when I come back through Istanbul next month and have cancelled it and booked someplace else. There are over one thousand hotels in Istanbul. There is no reason to stay somewhere that shows such disinterest in customer service.","July 21, 2015","27    Hotel Tulip House

He then recommended a few good restaurants and told us they would be happy to allow us to check in early! The rooms were clean and well appointed. I had a nice little balcony and a mini fridge. My sister's room had the fridge but no balcony.

Furthermore, they suggested suitable tours and organised all of our hotel transfers. Room was okay for three people, as we knew the size when the booking was made, it was sufficient enough as we were out for most of the time. On our first day, we had to leave early for a Gallipoli tour and the kitchen staff were kindly enough to prepare each of us with a plate of light breakfast. The hotel was not on the main street and required a bit of a walk which we didn't mind, however it may not be suitable for the elderly and those with young children.

(don't really know what a difference between my room and budget room).This hotel seems to be a combination of two hotels in on? It had two staircases next to each other and the lift only goes to the other side so you will need to use the stairs 1/2 a floor if your room is on the ""Tulip Hotel side"". I think the other one is Art City Hotel Istanbul.My room was T404, it was facing the alley on the 2 floor, the view was not nice, but i knew that already when booking a budget room.I'm sure the view from the other side of the hotel is great on the top floors!Room was nice size with a big bed (queen size I think), big enough for 2 people.Bathroom was modern and working. Water pressure was not the best but adequate.It had an ac unit(didn't use), And a large radiator (used on one cold night).It had just single windows so sounds carry from the ally pretty clearly.There is a mosque just 1/2 a block from the hotel so be wary of the morning call to prayer! (If you are a light sleeper it will wake you) (earplugs!)Breakfast was included in the room price. It was ok, nothing special... you should consider having a traditional breakfast at a local restaurant and sample all the Turkish specialties ... no just the basic white bread and cornflakes.

1309,"Hotel Tulip House is a Great value, Very Friendly Staff, safe location, quiet neighborhood, has a breakfast up on top with a good view and close walk to many historical sights and museums famous mosques, Chora Church now a museum. I want to stay there on my next Vacation to Istanbul, Turkey. So much to see in Turkey for everyone. Over 60 percent of Biblical History occured in Turkey. If you plan right and check out each area you travel to away from Istanbul you can see the Seven Churches of Revelation by yourself using a bus from the Turkish Otogar (Bus Station) to travel close to each location Church) and use a mini bus or taxi to reach each location. Of course, the seven churches of Revelation locations now have different names but pepole at each town knoe where you want to go and generally will help you find where you want to go. Gor example; Ephesus is now near the modern city of Selcuk, Izmir was Smyrna, Dinizli is close to Laodica, Alisahir is where Pjilidelphia is located and only covers a very small area, Akhisar is where Thyatira is located, Sart is where Sardis is located and a 20 minute or so walk away is the Temple of Artimis and a small church at the end from the 300's AD and Bergama has a Big Church ruins and 26 minute walk away is Pergaman which you can walk to or take a ski lift to and see some pretty neat ruins.Practice up on a little Turkish and download a translater onto you tablet, cell phone or I phone and that will help. I also went to Iznik, which used to be called Nicea and which is where the Nicean Creed was written in AD 325. You can see the actual church where the Nicean Council took place. The church was changed to a mosque in the year 1333, but still is predominately Christian influence to the church. It has an old minaret on the front left side. The vity of Nicea, now Iznik, was originally planned out with the main streets that cross as an actual Cross. There are many Fortress walls still standing and a Roman theatre. This city of Iznik, formerly Nicea, is the Third Holiest place for Christians behind Jersulem and the Vatican in Rome. Finally, I saw the first known Christian Cave Church in Antakya, formerly known as Antioch, which Apostle Peter himself helped build. This is where Christians were first called Christians. In 1198, during the Crusades, the Crusaders built a new facad. Awsome, to stand at the alter where Peter and Paul preached the gospel. Don't forget to see the Archelogical museum near St Peter Cave Church (St Pierre Kelissi as it is called in Turkish.) The have some of the finest Roman era mosaics anywhere in the World. Note: See Konya city where the world famous Hercules Sarcophagus is housed in a small museum. There are many Sarcophaguses there but the Herculese Sarcophahus was made from a single piece of Marble; beautiful piece of artwork.Pamakkule, formerly Hiropolice, Has two Roman gates still syanding and a Roman road that you can walk. A big museum at the end and the white cliff with calcium water running, where Cliopatra once went too and one of the most complete Roman theatres in existance.

1323,"We stayed in a family room for 4 nights, but had we known the room was so small, we would have definitely booked two twin rooms instead. The beds were comfortable and the bathroom was good- especially the shower. But the air conditioning was not adequate for four people in the middle of August. So we spoke to the manager and he quickly gave us a fan which helped a lot. Also, the staff delivered a mixed service; the manager and kitchen staff were consistently friendly. But we were greeted by a member of staff who tried to make jokes that were quite frankly rude. It has to be said that this particular member of staff was politer the next day though. We had a problem on our second evening, as we returned to the hotel at around 10 pm but the doors were locked. After knocking and waiting for five minutes with my daughter who desperately needed to use the toilet, a member of staff finally opened the door. When I asked why the door was locked, he replied very disrespectfully. He also mimicked what I said and asked in a very rude manner: 'why are you so angry? I only went downstairs, you didn't have to wait that long.'Even though we booked for four adults, we had to request an extra bed- which wasn't a problem but I had to go up and down the four flights of stairs five times to ask for the pillow for that bed. On the positive side, breakfast was really good and there was a wide choice everyday. The location was also excellent, and most places were within walking distance. There were also a range of restaurants very near to the hotel.The location is really the best feature about this hotel, so if you are looking for somewhere that's close to the centre but you are willing to compromise with other features, then this hotel is ideal.","September 7, 2014","27    Hotel Tulip House

The staff is friendly and the rooms are clean. Each room is dedicated to a Jazz musician and Jazz is played on the speakers (don't worry you can turn the music off if Jazz is not your cup of tea).On the negatives: Breakfast ist very sparse. In Turkey and we did not once have simit (turkish bagel) available for breakfast. The selection of cheeses and meats were limited to a selection of one of each. The omelette was usually very dry and the coffee service was poor. If you are on a Business trip and only want a quick bite then I am confident this will suffice, but for a holiday I personally felt it was rather lean.The wifi is sufficient for messaging, but too slow if you intend to stream anything.Bottom Line: I would stay here again if I intend to stay for only a short time and will be out and about mostly. If on a longer holiday of up to a week then I would opt for something else. Not to be understimated however is the price of the hotel compared to others in the neighbourhood.","October 3, 2017","28    Jazz Hotel

1361,"Although not in the central tourist locations of Istanbul the Jazz Hotel is a great little boutique hotel with rooms under £100 per night. I was staying here on a business trip as I needed to be based in Nisantasi. It's up a little back street off the main road so pretty quiet for an Istanbul hotel where you can expect a lot of traffic noise 24 hours a day. The rooms are all themed for a Jazz musician and you can have jazz music piped into your room if that's your thing. There are only 12 rooms in the hotel so it's very cosy and quiet and the staff are very helpful and attentive.It's just 5 mins walk from Abdi Ipekci which is essentially the Bond Street of Istanbul with Prada, Gucci, Armani, Burberry and so on all located amongst some great cafes, bars and restaurants. Cabs into all areas of Istanbul are cheap and plentiful but beware, so is the traffic. You'll basically hit a traffic jam of some description 24 hours a day.The only reason I didn't give a mark of 5 is that the breakfast could have been a little better and whilst there is satellite TV there were on 2 English channels (both news) and so nothing to watch if in the room working as I was. There is a DVD player in each room though so take some if needed.","November 4, 2014","28    Jazz Hotel

The nearest metro station is literally 5mins walk away, but even so, you can walk to Taksim Square, for about 15mins only. Not only that, the hotel is located just a street behind the main road make the area quiet at night, and get good sleep. - This is the only hotel that gave me a welcome and farewell gifts! A box of Turkish delight when I first arrived my room, and a CD with Jazz tracks, specially produced by the hotel. Lovely!In summary, it is an amazing small hotel to stay in Istanbul :)","June 2, 2013","28    Jazz Hotel

Staff were very helpful in providing advice regarding travelling further afield in the city and assisting with any problems we encountered.Great location, there is a very good shopping area in close proximity. This also provided plenty of places to eat on an evening.Cannot recommend this hotel highly enough.","May 9, 2013","28    Jazz Hotel

1379,"We started our vacation to Turkey in Istanbul and stayed at the hotel. It is a beautiful hotel right in the middle of old Istanbul. I can't say enough about the people at the hotel. We had a wonderful experience with all of the people and were able to see the wonders of ancient Istanbul. We were scheduled to leave after four days but unfortunately I became very ill. We extended our stay one day so I could just rest. My wife and I were treated like family. Long story short we travelled to Izmir and I ended up in a hospital for 10 days with pneumonia. The hotel is run by a small family and the staff has been working there for many years. I can understand why. They are the most welcoming, caring people I have ever met. You will feel like you are home. I truly consider them friends and look forward to seeing them again.","June 4, 2019","29    Hotel Valide Sultan Konagi

1380,"We stayed for 4 nights in October 2018....As my title states, this hotel is a true gem and it really is the staff that make it! Veysel, Mahmut and Ramazan (Baba) are what make this hotel so special! So thank you so much to all of you for making our stay wonderful ❤️We had pre arranged the airport transfer offered by the hotel ( we didn't have to pay for the return journey until we checked out).On arriving at the hotel we were made so welcome and treated as if we were family. Turkish coffee/tea was offered to both of us and we were told to relax and rest after travelling. After our refreshments we were taken upstairs and were given the option of choosing our room! We had paid for a triple room (this was the only option available to us on booking with Expedia) and chose this actual room as it was really spacious. Veysel arranged for the single beds to be pushed together for us. Veysel recommended a wonderful restaurant to us and also a bar (Shadow Bar) both of which were fantastic. We loved the elegance and traditional Ottoman style of the hotel and the friendliness of the staff. Every evening when we returned from dinner Mahmut would make us a Turkish coffee and sit and chat with us, he told us so much about Istanbul and Turkey. Breakfast every morning was lovely, a traditional Turkish breakfast with both hot and cold food. Baba would always ensure that our coffee cups were filled and we sat and relaxed with the wonderful panoramic views of the Bosphorus, Ayia Sofia and the Blue Mosque. The hotel is perfectly situated for all of the major attractions of this beautiful city. Veysel is so helpful and would explain the easiest routes to where we wanted to go, giving us lots of historical information too.To conclude if you wish to find a beautiful, small and friendly hotel where you are treated like family then the hotel Valide Sultan Konağı is the perfect place. We can't wait to return. ","May 27, 2019","29    Hotel Valide Sultan Konagi

1384,"We only had 14 hours in Istanbul, arriving at 11P and departing at 1P. So, really we only had 1-2 hours to do any sightseeing. This hotel made the experience perfect. They arranged the shuttle from the airport, so we didn't have to try to manage a taxi at 11P at night. Faisel got us checked in quickly, so we could get to bed. The breakfast was amazing and Rambo offered us great service. The view from the rooftop restaurant, while eating breakfast was perfect. We could see the Blue Mosque, Hagia Sophia, the Topkapi palace wall and the Bosphorus. After the delicious meal, it was a 5 minute walk to Hagia Sophia and Topkpapi. Given our limited time, we only went to Hagia Sophia, but being so close to everything was perfect. Then they arranged a shuttle back to the airport. We didn't have to stress about anything, which given our limited time, made for a top notch experience. I hope to return someday and definitely would stay here again. Great service, reasonable prices.The only downside is the rooms are small and setup for couples or singles. For our purposes, this was fine. It was a comfortable bed to sleep on during our limited stay. If one was travelling with friends, they would have to get two rooms, or share a bed.","September 1, 2018","29    Hotel Valide Sultan Konagi

These people have made us fell like home, we had a wonderful vacation, a unique and unforgettable experience.Most important thing is that these people became for me and my fiancée, a new family and when i say a family, i say it from all my heart and in the true meaning, because the Mama and her daughter, made a traditional ceremony for us before we left the hotel. We were in lots of places, countries, diferent hotels but this is the first time when our heart was broken and we had tears in our eyes becouse we had to leave.We recommend this hotel and I will definitely return here every time I have the opportunity.

If there are some issues, they do their best to solve them and being there, one feels that guests are the most welcomed. Breakfast is delicious. It is Turkish special and many things are home cooked, not traditional international hotel breakfast. Therefore, it is great added value for this place. And the breakfast service is so homy and friendly, we felt as we were visiting our grandfather who expressed his care.

Rather than endure that, I asked my travel agent to book me the closest small hotel to the famous Hagia Sofia, a place I've always wanted to see. The hotel we chose was the Valide Sultan Konagi, and there could not have been a more ideal place for my introduction to one of the world's most enchanting cities. It's a mere block away from a charmingly busy district of fine restaurants ands shops. The hotel is a jewel, the staff gracious, caring and sufficiently fluent in English, the rooms immaculate, and the breakfast superb. Ask ""Rambo"" to cook your eggs and make Turkish coffee!

1396,"A good bed and a good shower are the two major prerequisites that make my wife happy when travelling. And you know the drill, 'a happy wife is a happy life'. Thankfully, this family-owned hotel came up trumps on both scores. Our room (309) on the third floor, while small, was comfortable enough and had great views of the Bosphorus and the Sea of Marmara. The hotel's location in Sultanamhet is just perfect for visiting the major attractions of the Blue Mosque, Hagia Sophia and Topkani Palace. The palace entrance is two minutes away with the Blue Mosque and Hagia Sophia only several more minutes away. The breakfast and dining room on the top floor offer even more expansive views of the Sea of Marmara, the Bosphorus and the imposing Hagia Sophia. And just around the corner is Akbiyik Street and its many restaurants. Staff at the hotel are very welcoming, friendly and only too happy to offer advice and help. One of the staff, Erol, even walked us to the nearest tram stop to show us how to get a ticket. Mahmut and Feisel at the front desk also deserve a special mention as does Ramazan (Rambo) who looked after us at breakfast time. Ramazan made my 70th birthday that little bit more special with a gift of a bottle of red wine. Nothing was too much trouble for him. I found the daily room rate of around $75 Australian more than reasonable and because we stayed there for almost two weeks, they arranged a free pick up from Ataturk Airport and a free trip for the return journey.

The breakfast room is on the last floor of the hotel, with great views on the Bosporus and ships cruising up and down the strait. The breakfast itself is Mediterranean with local cheeses, olives and cakes. It may appear basic - but it offers something for everyone to enjoy. Hotel staff is friendly and helpful. In some occasions we felt they are working on a commission based salary as they tried to push to make us book dinners, cruises and taxi rides via the front desk. Needless to say that the price of these services were all higher than the ones we found outside.

My room and bathroom were clean and had an amazing view of Hagia Sophia (the room, I mean, not the bathroom). Several good value restaurants are just a few minutes' walk away.

1415,"Stayed here with my friend for four nights in February. The location is a stone's throw away from the Blue Mosque and Hagia Sophia. It's also possible to walk to the Old Bazaar - about 10min walk up the hill. The hotel itself boasts 3 floors of rooms. We were the only guests during our stay (we went in February shortly after the attacks, there weren't many tourists about in the whole of Istanbul), and because of that we got to pick our room. The front staff was great. Provided us with tips, maps and general information about the life in Istanbul. We were greeted with Turkish tea upon arrival.The room itself had enough space, sufficient storage and the bathroom was clean and lovely. The bed was comfortable and it was warm.The breakfast is served in the rooftop restaurant, which overlooks the Hagia Sofia and the sea, and is served by a lovely gent. It consisted of omlette, some olives, a selection of cheeses and tea and coffee.We would happily stay here again.","June 22, 2016","29    Hotel Valide Sultan Konagi

1419,"After battling through the road works and traffic jams, our first impression of the hotel was it's peaceful location (n.b.during the day up until late afternoon, this area is used by taxis and minibuses for drop-offs). Faisal, the concierge, came out to meet us and immediately offered tea (the first of many over the course of our stay) on the hotel's cool, marble terrace where we enjoyed the view of the Topkapi walls and the Hagia Sophia. The staff, including young Furka the bellboy and Rambo in the breakfast room, together with the brilliant location really make this hotel a little treasure. The hotel itself is absolutely spotless and the rooms, although small, are charming. We were offered the choice of three rooms and chose a corner bedroom with fantastic views of the sea and the Hagia Sophia. Breakfast is self-service and Rambo is on hand to whisk up an omelette and offer hot drinks. The hotel arranged a transfer to the airport and our driver had provided water and Turkish delight for the trip! We had considered cancelling our trip to Istanbul because of official travel warnings but security is highly visible all over the city and we never felt in any danger.","April 18, 2016","29    Hotel Valide Sultan Konagi

1420,"I had a wonderful 8 nights in Istanbul at Hotel Valide Sultan Konagi. It was my first visit to Istanbul, and the staff made me feel right at home. Ferdi, Gockhan, Mahmout, Rambo -- all true professionals who took good care of me, gave me excellent advice on touring the city, and generally made me feel welcome. I think I was the only guest in this boutique hotel for the first part of my stay, as I went during low season and arrived 2 days after the Sultanahmet bombing on January 12, 20016. My room (310, I think) had a stunning view of the Hagia Sophia. The bed was comfortable, the bathroom was lovely, the wi-fi was reliable. I loved having breakfast on the top floor terrace looking out across the Bosphorus. And all for a very reasonable price. I would highly recommend this hotel, which is conveniently located near all of the big attractions in Sultanahmet and close to the tram station.","March 6, 2016","29    Hotel Valide Sultan Konagi

1422,"The good about this place was the location, it was a very very short walk to the Aya Sofa and Topkapi palace. The room was quite small and we were told that it was one of their larger rooms. The room was pretty to look at and offered a lovely view of the Aya Sofya but that was it. The mattress was kind of uncomfortable and the heating was never working the entire time we were there which unfortunately for us was 3 whole nights and in December while the temperature outside was -10 degree Celsius. We complained to the hotel staff several times and they kept saying they would 'send someone' and never did. We then asked them to give us a different room and they said they would get it fixed in 10 minutes so there is no need for a new room. We stayed two more nights after this and no one fixed anything. We had just given up and cuddled to stay alive. I don't think the staff were trying to be rude to be fair, I think they were just inefficient. The cleaning service was quite sloppy as well.The staff were also somewhat pushy at times about some attractions they had tie-ups with including souvenir stores, cruises etc. I guess they seemed like they were trying to be helpful but we certainly didn't appreciate it when they recommended a restaurant of their ""friend's"" that 1. had awful awful awful food2. ALSO had no heating, and3. had the owner and some other businessman of some sort arguing heatedly the whole time we were there.So in conclusion, if you want a good view and a mediocre stay this place is fine. Good views are not hard to come by in Sultanahmet though. We did stay however at a couple of other hotels who did have heating.","January 5, 2016","29    Hotel Valide Sultan Konagi

1423,"I stayed here on a solo sightseeing trip to Istanbul and loved this little hotel. The location is fantastic. You are a 1 minute walk to Hagia Sophia and Topkapi Palace. The Blue Mosque and the Sultahmet tram stop are about 3 minutes away.My view of the Bosphorus, over the Topkapi Palace walls, from room 307 was amazing. I opened my windows wide at night to let the cool air in from the sea. Each morning I would awake to hear the call to prayer from the mosques and watch absolutely stunning sunrises over the Asian side of the city.The view of Hagia Sophia from the top floor restaurant is beautiful. The morning breakfast buffet was a nice treat—cereal, hard boiled eggs, yogurt, pastries, tzatziki and fresh tomatoes and cucumbers, sliced meats and cheeses—and a great way to start the day. The restaurant manager, Rambo, is very kind.The staff could not be nicer or more accommodating. They had lots of information about the sights and restaurants in the area. Ferdi, who seemed to run the front desk, was friendly and always willing to offer tips (also, he was quite a cutie!).It's an old refurbished Ottoman house/mansion, so rooms are a bit on the small side, but what the hotel lacks in modern amenities it more than makes up for in charm, staff, and location.

1424,"We stayed here for two nights recently after arriving from NY,. The hotel is in a perfect location and the staff very very helpful and friendly. The breakfasts are excellent as well. Keep in mind the rooms (or at least ours) was kind of small, but considering the city location and the price this was not unexpected. Having said that, the beds were comfortable. But be prepared for the ""call to prayers"" being blasted very early in the morning. (In Istanbul you really can't get away from them, so you learn to not hear it.) Another point: You do not need to arrange transportation from the airport in advance. A taxi from the airport ran us comparable to about $35 or 40.","November 21, 2015","29    Hotel Valide Sultan Konagi

1426,"I found this hotel through Rick Steve's book and one off the things he intimated was that this place is a bit ""tired"". We didn't find that to be the case at all! Lovely interior, extremely clean and tidy, large windows that open either to the very close Hagia Sophia or the Bosphorus. The call to worship is very up close and personal and quite an experience if you are on the mosque side! The staff could not be more friendly, accommodating and attentive. You can tell that their goal is to be hospitable in every way. Buffet breakfast has a very large selection and views from the dining area are stunning. You can eat either inside or outside. The beds and pillows are super comfortable and oftentimes that is hard to find on your travels. Maybe the best thing of all is its location. For all sights in the old city you need only to walk... And I even have a knee that acts up from time to time but all the places for sightseeing were very doable for me. Restaurants in this vicinity abound! And so many of them ooze Turkish culture and create wonderful memories. We are checking out of the hotel this morning and are leaving with only fabulous memories!","October 8, 2015","29    Hotel Valide Sultan Konagi

The staff there is so generous and they make you feel so comfortable in every way possible. The hair dryer in my bathroom wasn't working and the hotel arranged for a new one within minutes.
