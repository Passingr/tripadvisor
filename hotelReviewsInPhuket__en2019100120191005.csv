0,"Splash Beach Resort is well located and has everything the family needs for perfect vacations (amazing and helpful staff - especially guys named MISHA (hope I spelled it correctly) and FADON, complimentary waterpark access and lovely setting). The breakfast has a large variety of dished to choose from. The noise from a nearby airport is not a problem, even at night. One setback though - if you do decide to book a room in Splash Beach Resort, I would highly recommend to spend a little more and pick Executive Room or higher. The difference between Executive and Deluxe rooms is gigantic. Execs are much cleaner, spacier and better located but most importantly - what struck us the most when spending two nights in Deluxe after 8 nights in Executive was how the bathroom needed a renovation - when we moved in we found a water on the floor. We couldn't locate its source - at first we thought it was a leaky toilet but it turned out there was a crack in a ceiling (covered in mould) and the water was dripping behind the mirror and all the way down to the floor. Hope it’s just a phase and these rooms will soon get a much needed renovation because the complex as a whole is a great place!One more thing - at the end of our stay there was some sort of business conference taking place in the Resort and all the meals for „regular” hotel guests had been moved to Baan Thai restaurant which, aside from its beautiful setting, is an open building with no air conditioning - it wasn’t comfortable to eat breakfast in hot and humid environment. Also, because of the conference, electric buggies which are normally used to transport hotel guests around the Resort, were also mainly occupied by the conference folks and the hotel management thought it would be good idea to let tuk-tuks in to the Resort which resulted in noise, horrible exhaust smell and danger on Resort’s footpaths.","July 11, 2019","0    Splash Beach Resort by Langham Hospitality Group

1,"We have been staying at the splash beach resort from the 28th June .We have had the best hospitality, courtesy the Indian chef ATUL who was kind enough to introduce himself and make sure we were given an Indian breakfast everyday.Also he catered to one of our children who was allergic and made specific food for him too.Chef Praveen too was very nice to us !!!!","July 8, 2019","0    Splash Beach Resort by Langham Hospitality Group

4,I stayed here for 2 nights. This was the perfect length of stay for my 2 teen boys and me. We played at the water park all three days. My wife relaxed in the very comfortable and modern room. You do here planes take off when you are outside your room. If you have PTSD then don’t stay here. My friend recommended this resort to me and I will recommend it to my family and friends. Room extremely great. Water park great. If you want everything to be perfect then go to Disneyland. This is an amazing place for Thailand. My kids thought it was better than Great Wolf Lodge. I did 5 nights in a villa and 2 nights here. This was a great for my family. ,"July 4, 2019","0    Splash Beach Resort by Langham Hospitality Group

6,"I stayed there with my husband and kids for 2 nights only. I wish we stayed more! Its a huge place approximately 47 acres of land, lush green with lakes, water park, infinity swimming pool, villas, rooms in different categories, restaurants, bars and buggies to take you around and yes a private beach! What else could you ask for on a vacation! We all loved it! The staff explains everything at your check in and for any problem you face or any assistance you need, just dial 0. Extremely professional staff! My experience started with my reservation which was handled my mainly Ms. Chonticha and her other team mates including her Reservation Manager. I booked directly with the Hotel. I had different queries and I kept emailing them and they kept responding and handling each concern. Ms. Alina was extremely courteous and helpful. So was Mr. Sinaporn. We were checked in by Mr. Ta, he escorted us to the room while explaining all the facilities if the Resort and also gave us a map. He also guided us for the magic number 0 which deals with all your queries. I was highly impressed by the quick response to everything. Loved the view from infinity pool. Their breakfast was ample and healthy. Had dinner at the Splash Kitchen. Lovely food! I will definitely return with family and friends and also recommend this place for a lovely vacation. And yes it is near the airport so you do get to hear the airplanes taking off and flying past but when you are tired from a fun filled day at the water park and swim at the infinity pool, who cares about the airplanes! I didn't hear anything once I dozed off! ","June 30, 2019","0    Splash Beach Resort by Langham Hospitality Group

7,"For all that Langham represents, I had high expectations for this property. Sadly, the downsides we had experienced with this property far outweighed the environment.+ Lush landscaping+ Staff who try as best, despite poor fluency in English Language.- Poor food quality/ dining options- Noisy (Towers 2 and 3 completely exposed to the noise of airplanes taking off)- Mosquito-prone environment- Odd-shaped roomsFor every positive we encountered in service, there was always something at the back that bothered us.1. We were given early check in when we arrived on property at 11am. However, instructions given by our travel agent didn’t match the instructions in their system so they did not accord us Club Lounge access.2. The room they had first put us up in was grand - it had two bedrooms and en-suite bathrooms, a double sink setup for the Master bathroom. However, the dining table was riddled with ants AND we were awoken by loud pellet firing at 5.40pm (we were put up in a room facing some in-house construction).3. On requesting a room change, service came promptly to move us, but across the hallway. This time, the same 2BR had a different configuration and the room size is markedly smaller.4. For the duration we were on this property, they were booked for a large scale wedding. This meant the standard breakfast place was closed for 3 mornings in a row and dinner options were limited. Such a bummer to be given a sheet upon arrival on location. It would have been better hospitality to email your guests ahead of time and/or provide a heads up on your webpage for service outage.5. The new breakfast place was outdoors, and we became mosquito breakfast before getting to our breakfast. Gentle caution to load up on your insect repellent, esp if you are traveling with children!6. Breakfast quality was really, really poor. I cannot reconcile with the other reviewers’ comments about the breakfast quality - it sounded like we were on a different resort!7. Splash Jungle was complimentary for our booking, but everything from towels to lockers to water had to be paid for. Food at the “park” was a mixed bag of hits and misses - the wood-fired pizza was the only item which was reliable in our 3 days in location. I would be super bummed if we had to pay for entry fees on top of the miscellaneous charges.8. Dinner was just bizarre. It was told to us as “International Buffet”, but the line up had a live pasta kitchen + a few dry/ tough meat dishes + a seafood casserole, soup and 2 Indian dishes with a pathetic cheese board. Dessert was honestly half-hearted - melted chocolate mousse in milk and white versions, a mille-feuille dish and 2 sponge cake types.And yet, kids ate for free. So we took it like any normal meal, had one plate of mains and went off.A holiday on this property was barely relaxing - we either had to walk in mosquito-infested grounds or wait for a buggy every 15 minutes. The limited dining options also meant we had to constantly plan ahead for our 2 kids. This is a definite no-return location for us - our trip last year at a Choeng Thale property was way better thought-out for us every step of the way.","June 24, 2019","0    Splash Beach Resort by Langham Hospitality Group

8,"When we arrived, the staff that served us spoke fluent English which made the whole process smooth. She was very polite and friendly. She upgraded us to a king's room, which was big and comfy. As our flight was at night and our hotel deal included breakfast, we could takeaway the meal to the airport. Also, the hotel helped us to hire a taxi to the airport and even helped us bargain the price (of course upon our request). Our room was near to the water park, but there was little directions and signs to guide us so it took a while to get there. Also the shuttle bus service was confusing. We asked the staff to help us call for one each time we need one. The water park has too little stuffs to play. 3 hours max. Did not get to try their restaurants because there were local ones right outside the hotel. Not many choices but at least they were cheaper than the hotel restaurants. We were told there was a beach next to the hotel that could see the sunset, but we didn't go.","June 22, 2019","0    Splash Beach Resort by Langham Hospitality Group

9,"The rooms are clean, comfortable and serviced daily. The property has lovely gardens to walk around and a beautiful infinity pool which is beach-side. It was really reasonably priced for the the amenities provided. Plenty of restaurants on-site or nearby. The Splash Water Park is accessible from the resort and part of the package. Great for kids and adults. It is close to the airport so planes can be seen and heard. We didn't find this to be a problem.

10,We stayed at this hotel on 13 Jun 2019 for 1 night.Location ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐This hotel is situated near Mai Khao Beach and it's a mere 15 minutes drive away from the airport. Breakfast ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ + ⭐I would give a 6 stars!! The breakfast was superb during our stay with plenty of bacon. Spoiled for choice! Staffs refilled the foods promptly and attempted to chit chat with their guests with bright smiles. Very welcoming environment in an air-conditioned dining place. This is a family friendly resort wth free access to water park. Late check-out at 2pm was granted during our stay too. We wish to stay longer though!I highly recommend this resort to everyone! ,"June 20, 2019","0    Splash Beach Resort by Langham Hospitality Group

13,"It was indeed an unforgettable experience for us while staying at Splash Beach Resort.The resort is too huge lush and vast with lots of amenities and they have full fledged buggies available to make you go here and there within the resort.We stayed in Ocean 8 and got a one bedroom apartment with kitchenette.The view was good from the big balcony overlooking plane spotting, splash jungle and villas etc...We mesmerised with the services by Splash Kitchen team especially Nuch she is a gem for the restaurant. Nuch made an extraordinary effort for my wife when she noticed my wife require first aid she took by herself and arranged bandaid , oitnment etc.. she made extra efforts to play with our child to make us more comfortable her attitude towards services is exemplary and we noticed a great growth in her... Our special thanks to the following1. Nuch2. Pim3. Aof4. Dream5. Banana6. Atul (Indian chef)7. Praveen (Indian Chef)The Indian chef are very good in understanding demands of Indian guest hence they are also a good asset of the Splash Resort.The check in was however not smooth as we have to wait in lobby area for almost 1.5hrs however we got the room by 1200hrs which is still ok. I would suggest please install AirCon in lobby area as it's quite hot and humid while waiting for the room.The beach area is most beautiful place as every evening they do a DJ night with Live Bar quite happening while you dip in pool. The pool is quite big alongside a kids pool is also good.Baan Thai is also good but the service not upto the mark even though the restaurant was empty however we have to asked them 3 times just for water service.Kudos to team Splash Kitchen they made our Breakfast and Dinners during our stay.Overall the best place to stay in Phuket with Splash jungle free entry, Indian food, big integrated resort, lush greenery, lots of options for kids to do.","June 14, 2019","0    Splash Beach Resort by Langham Hospitality Group

14,"Overall I had a great vacation at the splash beach resort.. I would have given splash resort 5 stars if the check in process was smoother.. having booked the property online, the staff couldn’t place my booking initially, and while waiting.. my mom and kids were standing next to me for around 10-15 mins. It would have been nicer if someone requested them to sit at on of the lobby sofas while the staff was trying to place the booking. It’s a minor gesture, but makes a huge difference.. However the place, and the staff service after check in - makes up very quickly for the above.. The staff is very courteous.. the property is well maintained.. for reasonable prices.. we had a lot of fun. Thank you splash team!","June 12, 2019","0    Splash Beach Resort by Langham Hospitality Group

Mistake in booking and checking out on the night to stay at a real 5 star with service and quality food, judging by previous comments either people have low expectations in Thailand when many beautiful places or the manager thinks an apology will suffice, yet i hope even one person reads this and choses a nice place to stay..","June 9, 2019","0    Splash Beach Resort by Langham Hospitality Group

20,"It was unbelievable experience in this resort with the employee and management.Duration of stay: May 31st to June 2nd 2019Room: Ocean 9 - 9713Resort - 7/10 - good for kids to play with the water parkBuffet breakfast - 7/10 - decent but employees need to improve in basic English such as understanding of sunny-side-up or scramble egg...Thai Restaurants in resort - 5/10- expensive for the quality of basic/traditional Thai foodPool Service - 4/10 - really much self-service since there was no staff to walk around to check on the guest's orderRoom: 6/10 - water pressure was so weak, AC makes very loud noise, AC isn't clean.Here comes to the worst experience I had during my stay.On June 1st @8:05PM at Ocean 9 building, My husband accidentally left his Salvatore Ferragamo male leather wallet on the bench of the lobby Ocean 9 where there are 3 CCTV cameras around. On June 2nd @ 10AM, he realised the wallet was missing and informed the receptionist of the Resort ASAP but they said there was no wallet found. I then ran back to the receptionist to request for viewing the CCTV since we remembered the exact date and time we left the wallet. It took more than 1 hour to show me a very short clip from a far camera which could only see half of the lower body. The funny moment was they showed me only the time we were sitting there but not the time we left to see whom might have seen the wallet first. The receptionist told me that the 3 cameras at where we sat do not cover the place we sat.I ran back to the Ocean 9 lobby to check on those cameras which I am quite sure that they all can clearly view where the wallet was left. I then requested again to view the clip (time after we left) and specifically told them that I want to see the angle of 3 cameras. The receptionist seemed to avoid my request until I got quite upset to highlight my request has to be met at 9pm on June 2nd.When the time came, I was waiting at lobby to see the hotel manager about my request. The receptionist then told me to see IT manager whom showed me the clip. From the video clip, I could clearly see the person took the wallet and took the stuff out into his pocket.Here is the story from IT manager: 1. Mr. Adul (Maup/Maug) - Housekeeping supervisor who firstly took the wallet and took out the cash inside to put in his pocket. He then returned the wallet to Ms. Klidchaom Treyossakon - Assistance Housekeeping manager on June 1st 20192. Ms. Klidchaom Treyossakon - Assistance Housekeeping manager kept the wallet and forgot to file the case in Lost and Found Dept. She left the wallet in her office on June 1st 20193. On June 2nd 2019, the wallet was missing from her desk and no-where to be found until now.4. Hotel puts the case under-investigation with police.On June 3rd @ 9AM, I had to requested to speak to the Hotel Manager - Ms. Alina Hrom about our case and personally requested for the names whom took and involved with our wallet - Housekeeping supervisor - Mr. Adul (Maup/Maug) and Assistance Housekeeping - Ms. Klidchaom Treyossakon.I am very disappointed how Resort Management handled the situation. It seemed that they wanted to hide the evidence that their employees have been involving in our missing wallet. We do not know what is happening with the 2 persons whom had our item in their hands. It is our bad that we lost the wallet (cash, card and ID) but it is so unprofessional how Splash Beach Resort Mai Khao, Phuket managed the case. This was my experience with this resort!Suggestion: do request for CCTV to view the situation.","June 3, 2019","0    Splash Beach Resort by Langham Hospitality Group

21,"My small family and I just stayed the one night and enjoyed to amazing two days in the kids club and water park. All the staff were lovely and helpful. The breakfast was fantastic and all the prices for beer and soft drink were exceptionally fair without adding on 17% when you come to pay, what you see is what you pay just how it should be. The rooms were also very comfortable all not to far from the beach or water park. The main swimming pool is nicely right next to the beach and beach club bar. We will definitely be returning for our next small holiday as the resort is perfect for children however it would be nice if there were more shaded swimming areas in the water park as all the paddling pools for very young children were all in direct sunlight, you could seek out shaded spots on some of the bigger pools but nothing permanent for the shallow beginner pools.

I appreciated that the staff there asked for feedback of the food and they really do listened. The fee of 1 beef burger and pizza waived.Stayed in 10 - 11 Apr 2019","May 17, 2019","0    Splash Beach Resort by Langham Hospitality Group

33,"It’s ok for the kids, but it’s not a 5 star standard of accommodation or environment. Staff are great, but our exec double double room was barely 4 star. Dirty floor rug, bird droppings all over the balcony and shower that could not keep an even temperature, too hot then too cold. It’s also very noisy as it’s next to the airport. The beach side pool is nice until about 11am when the staff put on music way too loud under the guise of doing pool aerobics. Only about 20% of poolside people took part in the aerobics on both days were were at the pool, so there’s no need for everyone at the pool to be disturbed. Overall I found the stay disappointing. I won’t be going back. ","April 29, 2019","0    Splash Beach Resort by Langham Hospitality Group

35,"17 of our family stayed here, some for 1 and some for 2 nights - the hotel rooms, lobby, restaurant & beach were all to a very good standard. We did have several problems, most of our rooms were ready an hour early which was great but one room was under the wrong name and caused a little confusion. The water park could not locate room numbers for the correct guests which ended with some of us being let in without signing in, this was not a problem until the following day when we were told that the three wristbands we had put money onto on our first day were wiped of money. We were not told by any of the staff at either gate nor the security guard who asked me to hand in the wristbands but I replied I would use them tomorrow. (no cash is used in the waterpark and wristbands must be loaded with cash at the gate - you must claim unused cash at the gate each day), we were standing at the gates the following day for 40 minutes trying to resolve the very long winded & poorly explained way of doing things. Reception could not arrange transport for us to go out for dinner, they could not secure enough taxi's and the lady in the lobby bar refused to serve us at 8.40pm, hotel information showed the lobby bar closes at 9pm. There was a wedding during our stay & the beach, beach bar, large pool & areas were closed off, there were structures blocking the view all around the pool and beach and work going on throughout our stay, day and night. As reception could not arrange taxis we had to stay at the complex but was difficult to get back to our rooms after dinner the night before because private tuktuks for the wedding guests were the only transport, the hotel train did not appear for over 20 minutes so some of us walked back with the children but I had to stay and wait with my Mum, the wedding organiser kindly let us use their transport. We were a family group of three generations. Our stay could have been so much nicer.","April 27, 2019","0    Splash Beach Resort by Langham Hospitality Group

39,"Nice a close to the airport you can watch the planes takeoff from beachside pool.Had family room for family of 4 which was a decent size and clean.We had two separate issues with 2 rooms and staff were happy to move us 3 times and ended up in room with a balcony which was a better room than the previous two.Golf carts to help get you around.Food on offer at breakfast buffet was very good but the best spread seems to happen on weekends. It does get very chaotic though when other guests don’t understand the simple concept of lining up to be seated and staff scramble to sort them out or pushing into line for dishes.Dinner buffet is very good with what was on offer seafood, local and some western options.Alcohol is reasonable with some good drink specials.Kids enjoyed the pools and obviously having access to the Splash Water Jungle included was fantastic and kept the family busy.The Beach Club activities for kids and overall was great especially the fire show.It is a fair way away from Patong and Phuket town and getting to and from isn’t that cheap compared to say KL so we didn’t bother.Tried the restaurants outside the resort and were good but the food at Red Mango by Kin Dee was by far the best.Overall the family really enjoyed the stay and we’ve already recommended the resort to family and friends.","April 24, 2019","0    Splash Beach Resort by Langham Hospitality Group

Breakfast was the reason we did not give 5 stars, it was chaotic and food ran out very quickly, including long queues to get a drink. This is not necessarily all the fault of the hotel, as some guests were a little greedy, but not the most pleasant experience.

44,"Where do i start? 1. When we arrived at check in there was no one there to help us with our luggage, we had 2 car seats, 2 pushchairs, 2 cases and 2 hand luggage cases. My husband was left to move them out of the way as there was no one to be seen. Not the nicest welcome to a hotel after traveling for a long time with two small children. 2. When we got to reception to check in there was only one person there for check in, It was only 8pm so not too late. We queued up to check in and when it was our turn gave the lady our booking confirmation and she then told me we needed to go to a separate check in area as we were in a villa. Would have been helpful to know this before we queued up. We then had to wait 15 minutes for a golf buggy to arrive to collect us. When we had eventually checked in and got to our room we had been at the resort over an hour, not ideal when the check in wasn't even busy, i dread to think how long it would take at peak times. 3. The room. We booked a three bedroom pool villa. One room is only accessible from the outdoor pool area. So for a family with young children this is unusable. The twin room is downstairs. The master bedroom is upstairs behind a door, through the sitting area, through the bathroom, through the walk in wardrobe, i.e a long way away from the stairs and therefore unsuitable for children to be left unattended when there is around 5 doors downstairs that go out onto the swimming pool. We complained. There is NO photos on either to hotel website or any other site we looked at to show that the three bedroom pool villas have stairs. The penthouse rooms show stairs but this does not. The hotel need to make it clear to families that this room is not suitable for young families. We were then moved to a two bedroom pool villa but as we had pre paid were not offered any compensation. We spoke with the manager the next day and after lots of going back and forth were offered 10,000THB to be added to our room for credit to use in resort, not ideal when the actual difference is 30,000THB but i had had enough of going back and forth and didn't want to spend any more time arguing about it whilst on holiday. 4. The room has blinds in them, all around, in our children's room there was 5 cords alone. My husband tied them up to prevent our children seriously injuring themselves on them. Due to these blinds the rooms get so bright early in the morning, you could honestly read a book in bed without having to turn a light on.","April 20, 2019","0    Splash Beach Resort by Langham Hospitality Group

47,"Stayed for two nights before we left Phuket. We had visited the waterpark on previous trips so decided to stay at the resort this time to give it a try. We were upgraded to a three bedroom apartment which was amazing. Huge bedrooms each with large ensuites. The resort is huge and you either walk around though not much signage or a vehicle comes round to pick you up every five to ten minutes. The pros:Access to waterparkAmazing roomsClose to airportThe cons:Outdoor pool near the beach could do with a renovation as decking and surrounding areas look tired and old.Dining options - With such a large resort there is only really one or two places to eat. The reception bar didn't have any food options which if your waiting to be picked up after checking out is annoying. Breakfast buffet.......wow...I have never seen anything so chaotic ever in my time of staying in hotels and resorts!! Firstly the queue to get in can be quite long as on ly one staff member taking registrations. Then once you can find a table the buffet is madness with big delays on getting food due to the amount of people and the lack of chefs cooking. The juice containers were tiny for the amount of people waiting for drinks. Also you struggle to find anyone who is standing in an orderly queue, it seemed like a free for all most times. Staff try there best but they need a secondary breakfast outlet that is twice the size so you can get the day started off relaxing, not feel like your fighting for your last meal ever.We will most likely come back again but just hope these things are rectified.","April 17, 2019","0    Splash Beach Resort by Langham Hospitality Group

48,"Before I start my Review, let me make it very clear that I do not make reviews to just complain, I make reviews based on what I see and experience. As a Pilot I travel +250 days a year and stay in hotels around the world. But a few times your experience is either so good or so poor you need to tell others. I know the resort most likely gonna bring their standard reply to a negative review however that only goes to show how poor it is. Again I am not here to complain but to show the real side.My wife and I and 3 small kids aged 6 month, 4 years and 6 years, decided to do a last minute trip to Phuket due to the kids spring-break from school. Wanted it to be something for the kids to enjoy and not just a beach and a pool, very quickly Splach Beach resorts came up due to their water-park which seamed like a lot of fun so we booked the resort for 6 nights. Price was pretty good for a 5 star resort but it soon showed why.Upon arrival the reception was unable to located the reservation (although booked and paid directly to the hotel few days before) Having traveled a whole day with 3 kids the last thing you need is to sit for 45 min. While waiting for things to get in order. However after the wait we were issued keys for the room.The room on first look was nice and big, 2 bedrooms and a living-room very spacious, however having stayed at plenty of 5 star resorts before it quickly became obvious they need to catch up on things.Blood-stains on the curtains was a big no no, dirt in and around the corners especially in the showers, made it look like cleaning was purely changing bed-sheets and emptying trash. Sofas and chairs stained and made you wonder who or what has been sitting in them before.Having been told that our luggage would be send to the room right away I decided to call the reception after an hour of waiting in the room as we all wanted to change out of our cloth and into something new. However it took 2 hours for our bags to be delivered to the room, which is totally unacceptable.After a change of cloth we went to the main Splash restaurant as we were all hungry and having read the reviews the buffet seam like a good and quick option, however being a Family/Kid´s resort the buffet was no where kids-friendly, and offered very little options for kids below a certain age. (our kids are 4 and 6 years old, not taking our 5 month old into account) so we went with the regular menu, which was a disaster.The food was overpriced (Not for a 5 star resort) but over priced for what we got. We spend about 2000 bath which is about 65$ usd. But seam like food spit out from a factory kitchen. After that we went home to sleep.Next day we decided to go to the breakfast. The breakfast have received several praises and good reviews, which is understandable if you dont travel much but for a 5 star resort the breakfast was a MESS.Total chaos is the main words I would use to describe it. The resort caters to all, but mainly 2 nationalities stay in the resort and it was like a feeding fest with people going wild trying to put as much food on their plates as possible. Having only 2 coffee-machines makes the line for a cup of coffee take upwards of 10 minutes, not speaking of the line just to get into the breakfast which on certain days could take 15-20 minutes or more, as they only had one breakfast registration table.The food was sub-part, nothing close to 5 star and would be what to expect at any decent 3 star hotel. I am not fussy and I can eat food at a 3 star hotel without any issue but when you pay for 5 stars you expect that in return.After the chaos at breakfast we decided to go to the Splash water-park as this was the main reason why we chose the hotel. It may have looked decent 5 years ago, but the current state is a mess. The water-park is fun for the kids dont get me wrong, but it lacks a lot of maintenance, but the biggest issue was the staff or lack of. At no point can you leave your kids out of sight as the few lifeguards that they have on duty are either on their phone or simply just missing. The main water-slide towers had staff, but their English was non-existing and when asking them questions they were extremely rude and impolite. One went crazy on my wife as she was leaving one of the slides at the end to the right instead of to the left yelling at her in Thai.I know the water-park may be a separate company but as it is advertised by the hotel the hotel should make sure that the safety is assured, which without proper lifeguards its not.After spending a few hours in the water-park we decided to find the main pool near the beach. Without very many signs and the resort being as big as it is, its a nightmare to find your way around and we only just got it down the day before we left. However after some time walking around in the heat we found the pool.Here starts the big mess: The water was dark green and filthy, asking the staff why no-one spoke more than 1-2 words of English and all they could say was its ok its fine.Living in Dubai, with pools everywhere I know that the green color is either due to algae, too much copper in the water or too much algeacide. But the kids was hot so they jumped in. The rest of the pool area looks a mess. The wooden decking is in a poor condition, broken several places and with loose decking moving around when you walk on top of it. The baby-pool however seamed clean and the water was clear so the wife and I took the little one in that one.Not long after the kids jumped in, my youngest came running, her hair had turned green (She is blonde) and her swim-suite the same, I went back to the big pool to see my other daughter playing with a wire under the water. To my fear I saw it was electrical wires coming from an underwater broken lamp. I rushed her out of the water and went to the guy handing out towels and asked why in the world there was wires sticking out. With his lack of English he managed to say that it was broken lamp, and they knew about it for several days.I had a flip as everyone knows that electricity and water dont mix, so I went to the pool-bar where one of the guys spoke decent English and explained to him that it was unacceptable after which he called their engineering. 10 min. Later they arrived just to place a big red cone on top of the lamp, and I could not grasp what I just saw, as people were still swimming next to the electrical wires. I decided to jump into the pool and check all the lights and found several to be broken and some with quick fixes to the wires that were poking out of the lamps, so we decided not to gamble with our life and health and anymore green hair so we went to the other but smaller round pool.The other pool was cleaner and we all jumped in when my daughter asked what it was floating on the side of the pool. I went to check just to find yet another Lamp but this one was completely removed from the wall just floating on top of the water. I checked the rest of the lamps and all was broken after which I had enough.Splash Beach Resort prides them-selves as a family resort and for me my kids and wife safety is number one, so we got out and I decided to go speak to the manger in the reception as it is simply not acceptable conditions.The duty manager was very friendly and nice, and I told her what had happened and even had my daughter come with me to show her that her hair had gone green. I told her that I found it unacceptable that the condition of both the water quality as well the electrical issues was what it was and that I had never stayed in a hotel not even a 1 or 2 star hotel where my kids hair was colored green.I was told that upper management would be told and that things would be rectified.That night we had dinner at the Thai restaurant which for once was a good solution however rather expensive for a Thai resort spending about 3000bath for 2 adults and 2 kids.To my surprise I next day found that nothing was done to fix the electrical safety issues and their solution to the green color was to have guys walk through the pool with bags of chlorine pellets that was thrown by hand into the pool. It was a mess to look at but the chlorine started to take effect and 5-6 hours later the water started to change to be a bit more clear but throughout our stay it kept the same green tint, and we met other guests who had their cloth and hair dyed as well.Lifeguards are non-existing in the resort, they have guys to hand out towels but when they are not handing out towels they are busy on their phones, I have never stayed in a resort where lifeguards was not a 100% must at all times.We decided to have dinner at the beach bar the 3rd evening, and ordered drinks and food. We sat down pretty early as the kids have to go to sleep not too late and about 20 min. Later other guests started to come. Having waited for 50 minutes I stopped the beach bar manager and asked him why we had not been served our food or at least our drinks. The excuse was that there had been a mix-up but it would come shortly.I got served my food as the first one, but noone else not my wife or my kids got any food for the next 20 minutes, however another table who sat down 20 minutes after us was given their food. I asked again and shortly after the food and drinks was rushed to the table. We were offered free buffet dinner in the Splash restaurant but politely declined as we were not interested in eating in that place again. It was utter chaos and it seamed like noone was in control of the place at all.Next night we were gonna give their Friday BBQ dinner a change but it as as bad as the main splash restaurant and a complete waist of money.Having not had anyone clean our room after the first night I called the reception after the second night to ask about room-cleaning and was told it only is done if requested.. Again I have in my time as a Pilot stayed in many hotels and I have yet to find another where room-cleaning is not done automatically every single day.. We decided to walk outside the resort, and found by the exit/entrance where you have the water-park just a minute walk outside there were several restaurants and especially the Red-Mango was amazing. Great food and good prices, well above the standard at the resort.The night before we left the hotel I called and requested transportation at 9:30 and for our bags to be picked up NO later than 9:15. As we finished our breakfast (where one of the 2 coffee machines had broken down leaving to cues of more than 15 minutes for a cup of coffee) we went to checkout. We were there at 9:15 and I asked where our bags were. However they had no idea and had to request someone to go collect them.Our bags arrived at 9:30 and off we went.To complete this pretty lengthy review I just want to sum it up briefly.1) By no way in this world is the resort a 5 or even a 4 star resort, and it does not come close.2) The resort may be managed by Langham, but it has nothing to do with Langham quality (I have stayed in Langham properties before so I do know what I am talking about)3) Safety is not a concern for the hotel at all, if it was they would have closed the pools and fixed the electrical issues as well as the water quality. Lifeguards should be placed at every pool as long as the pool is open.4) Hardly none of the people working in the hotel speaks English making it hard to ask anyone for help or advice.5) The food is overpriced and sub-part and resembles nothing of a 5 star resort.6) The service level of the resort is so poor that I would not be able to recommend this hotel to any of my colleagues until the issues in the hotel has been resolved.7) It is easy to see that the hotel is geared towards certain nationalities more than others especially with whatever staff not being Thai being Russian speaking.For my family and I it was a rather unpleasant stay, the kids enjoyed the water-park but they are too young to understand safety concerns or water/food quality issues, having blood-stains on the curtains and dirt around the rooms including the sofa and chairs are just disgusting.I do not say this just to be another complainer I say what I see and experience, and I will truly forward my comments to the management at Langham Hospitality group.","April 16, 2019","0    Splash Beach Resort by Langham Hospitality Group

52,"To start, it is a reasonably priced resort close to the airport. In fact, you can hear the plane Everyday but not so loud that it disturb your sleep. The resort is practically beside the runway. Clean resort and so is the beach. They have family room of different sizes to suit all. If you are thinking of going snorkeling in the Similian Islands, suggest you choose this location as transfer is only an hour away.The bad and ugly. The resort majority consist of Russians. Next will be PRC and Indians. We took a holiday to be relaxed but this is far from relaxed environment. There is always a mad rush during breakfast and que is chaotic. All being housed in the same location, noise level is to the max. Also we had to fight the flies. I hate most is to see wastage. Ppl pile their plates to the brim than left having only a bite. Even our family young children asked why?!? Spread was good and constantly filled but no changes. We book the 3 bedroom apartment but they only managed to clean the room once a day. Even when we leave the room at 7am, they only manage to get our room clean around 3pm daily. We had to deal with dirty towels and limited toiletries. The Splash, only reason to opting this hotel, does not provide towels and the floor was scorching hot! hot! hot! So from ride to ride, we had to deal with getting our feet tender. But of cos the younger children enjoyed it with much persuasion. Perhaps more mister or trees would make it better?Conclusion, after 3 nights, we moved to another hotel. And the exclamation unanimously from 7 yrs old to 54 yrs old when we reach the other hotel? “Wow” “ Finally a hotel” “ This is what I call a hotel” spoilt family!!! (Follow me if you want to know the name of my next hotel) So, we wouldn’t go back to Splash. It is not a pleasant quiet family get away resort. But overall, i will still give this a 3.5 star resort. I Guess the branding and target guests really makes the hotel a great difference.","April 12, 2019","0    Splash Beach Resort by Langham Hospitality Group

55,"It was our first time travelling in Thailand and this hotel was honestly one of the best we’ve stayed during our travels. The rooms are lovely and spacious with nice decor and always clean. The breakfast was varied and suitable for everyone- we never left hungry !! The beach area was nicely designed with designated chairs and umbrellas, it was also lovely and private but still had good access to the full beach. The swimming pool and bar area were gorgeous and well kept. What made the pool/beach experience even more leisurely was the beach bag filled with towels provided in the room and the towels could be changed - this was a bonus !! The staff were very friendly and welcoming even the cleaning lady on our floor. As it was my girlfriends birthday during our trip the hotel decorated the room beautifully on arrival which made the trip even more special. Although slightly further out of Phuket town it was lovely and quiet but nothing seemed far away with only a 35 minute moped drive to the iconic big Buddha. We would definitely return to this hotel !!","July 8, 2019","1    Bandara Phuket Beach Resort

62,"When I first look in booking.com this was my second option, we choose this hotel because it has an ok rating (up 8.5) and their instagram photos were amazing. The hotel seem not that far from everything. When we get there it was in the middle of nowhere, which is ok since we needed to rest and enjoy, we’ve been traveling for 15 days. We get to the room and went to the pool to have some food, it was happy hour. My husband asked for a rum with coke and since it wasn't in the menu they couldn’t serve it although they have cocktails with rum and they have coke. Strike 1. We ordered pizza which was very good and it comes with two cokes (we only drink one and take the other one to the room and put it in the fridge) The live music in the bar was really good. Next day I get up really early to go to walk at the beach and to catch a sunbed my husband went down later. They never offered us something to drink and the beach (were the sunbeds are) was really dirty it seems they never razor the sand or clean there was broken glass and cigarettes. Strike 2. So I told my husband to make an upgrade to the villas which seemed nicer, I went to the reception and the guy there with very bad english told me to wait to the other girl, but the upgrade has to be like a 100usd, seems fair. When the girl arrived they told me the upgrade was about 8000 bahts! Thats 266 dolars for one night, in booking the same room was only 190usd. It supposed to be an upgrade and they want me to charge more than the cost of the room. We said no thanks and came upstairs to the mini pool to refresh, again bar closed. We went inside the pool and realized there was chicken bones in one corner, of course we came out immediately went to the room, take a bath and we ask for a taxi to get out fo the hotel. We just came back to sleep. Next morning we did the check out and they want to charge us for the coke we take from the restaurant that was already paid. After couple of minutes telling the girl we didn't grab it for the mini bar i said it was ok and paid it, not before i write down on my check i didnt agree about the charge and when i did it she just apologized and give my money back. It wasnt her fault. I would never come back to that hotel. I stayed in hostels and luxury hotels in my 20 days trip and this was the only one that I complained.

The hotel is located away from all the hustle and bustle of the main beaches, so if you can't live without beer-bars and shops selling t-shirts, this is not the hotel for you. Although remote there is a few restaurant nearby, so you don't have to eat at the hotel every night. The breakfast is average and I miss a manned egg-station.

68,"My wife and I really enjoyed staying at this hotel. We booked a deluxe room on the 4th floor and we had a partial sea view from the balcony which was stunning. The room was clean and had everything you would want from a hotel room.The restaurant served good food and great cocktails, all were reasonably priced (especially during happy hour 17:00 -19:00)! The staff were all very polite and spoke exceptional English. The breakfast had a large selection of food to choose from (fresh fruits, eggs, waffles, pancakes, fried rice/noodles). There were two automatic coffee machines (lattes, cappuccinos etc) but both were out of order during our time there. The beach was clean and the sea was beautiful. My only criticism is that the rule of ‘no reserving sunbeds’ was not enforced by the staff. It was very stressful everyday trying to get a sunbed due to other guests reserving sunbeds before breakfast everyday. There was one occasion were there was an argument between guests because someone had reserved their sunbed for over three hours and someone wanted to move it. This could all have been avoided if the rule was enforced better.But overall I loved this hotel, I thought the location was great, there are a few shops and restaurants along the main road but it was well out of the action of main Phuket. If you prefer a nice beach holiday as apposed to one where you go out every day then I would definitely recommend this hotel! ","March 19, 2019","1    Bandara Phuket Beach Resort

From the check in staff to paddle board instructor, nothing was too much trouble. Pool was small, so sunbeds went quickly, however the views were amazing, and there were more sunbeds on the beach.

83,"Hello!My husband and I just returned from visiting Thailand (started in Bangkok then ventured down to Phuket for a few days) and it was wonderful! We had heard/read a lot about where to go and where not to go while in Phuket but because we didn't want to be in the middle of a crazy party town but also didn't want an area that was super quiet, we were lucky to have found Bandara Beach Resort in Ao Yon Beach. This area was perfect. Tiny little ""town"" or ""village"" about 45-60 mins from the Phuket airport. So while yes, it takes longer to get to, its worth it. The resort was super clean, beach was beautiful, food was UNREAL amazing, views spectacular and there were other places to walk to if you wanted to venture off. The area was super safe as well. Two markets right beside the hotel (a 7-11 as well as a family mart), a couple of cute restaurants within a 3-20 min walk (there is one right on the beach about a 20 min walk away called The Beach Bar and Restaurant. Great little spot with local food and well worth the stroll along the beach at night to see all the lights. Again, super safe to get to. just ask someone how to get there). The staff were super friendly and helpful whenever we needed questions answered. I am vegan so found it hard to find coffee at the resort as well as anywhere else in the vicinity that offered any nut milks, but the green curry (with tofu) at the resort made the sacrifice for no coffee well worth it! I would highly recommend this resort for anyone looking to get away for a few days (or even longer). ","January 9, 2019","1    Bandara Phuket Beach Resort

We spent more time at the pool because the view is breathtaking! Food is very good at the hotel restaurants and bars. A bit more expensive than outside.Location is perfect for those who want to avoid crowd. It is a bit far from places of interest, but you can always take a tour or rent a car. I would recommend to rent a car! By the way, there is a local rent-a-car company next door (to the left from the hotel entrance) - friendly and honest. Can recommend them. We had a brand new car and a private parking place there everyday without any problems.When it is hot, it is perfect to have a car with air-conditioning. We were always happy to return to our hotel after sightseeing, because it is very cosy.Very nice restaurant just next door to the hotel. It looks simple, but food and service are excellent. We had dinners there almost every night. Tried other places but this remained the best.2 supermarkets just 50 meters from the hotel.Also 30 meters from the hotel you can buy fruits. Not a very big selection, but for everyday it is Ok.Wonderful place for romantic trip for a couple.Wouldn't recommend for travelling with kids, because there is no entertainment.I would love to stay at Bandara once again!","January 7, 2019","1    Bandara Phuket Beach Resort

86,"We visited Phuket for a holiday. Upon arrival we were made to feel instantly welcome, no detail left unattended. Our room was beautiful, housekeeping staff was impeccable. Management introduced themselves and went out of their way to make us feel special. We loved that each day staff inquired as to what we were doing that day and offered assistance with planning activities. Their activities like street food and BBQ seafood nights with live music made every day feel like a relaxed party with good friends. Thanks especially to Mr. Tee and Mr. Edd for their careful attention to detail. We will be back!","January 5, 2019","1    Bandara Phuket Beach Resort

87,"Bandara hotel seems to be the best choice for people who are looking for calm stay in the Phuket. Far from the noisy discos and nightlife attractions Bandara offers nice accommodation for a lazy, calm week in Thailand. The strongest points are: nice and helpful staff, cleanness, nice pool and bars located in the pool area and on the beach. For sure I will back to Bandara in my future travel to Thailand.","January 4, 2019","1    Bandara Phuket Beach Resort

88,"Great hotel overall. Room is very nicely equipped: we really liked the toiletries (big size and nice smell), slippers, robe, beach towel and the beach bag is a nice touch!Breakfast area is small, but nice choices with fresh fruit, sweet and savory options. Never got too crowded. There are various deals at the restaurants, including happy hour. Staff got our orders wrong few times, but in the end, everyone was nice and polite. The beach is really small, but feels secluded and quiet. Pool is nice,but way smaller than it looks in pictures. One caution for those that are first time in Phuket is that the hotel is far from everything, there are very very limited options for food nearby and to get to Patong it is a 30$ cab ride. Most tours (eg Phi phi islands) charge extra for transfer from here (same deal in Patong is 900 baht and here 2000). Would recommend for a short relaxing stay, but not to do exploring the island from here,","December 31, 2018","1    Bandara Phuket Beach Resort

89,"I wanted a hotel in Phuket that was on the beach and the Bandara Phuket Beach resort offered me everything that I was looking for. Bandara is located in a quiet part of Phuket. However, there are several businesses, restaurants, convenience stores nearby within walking distance. I found this to be tremendously beneficial compared to other resorts that are rather isolated with nothing around them. The building and its facilities are wonderful. I lucked out and received a balcony room facing the ocean, but most balcony rooms are positioned on the side of the building. The breakfast was good, the pool is beautiful (however, seating is at a prime!), the beachfront seating is great. The beach is beautiful. I booked a couple excursions through the hotel and the airport transfer, all of which worked great. The staff was very friendly. The only other resort in this little town is the Bandara Villas, which seemed really nice. For a lot more money, I'd like to try that place sometime, too. My only complaint, and this has nothing to do with the hotel, is that I traveled alone, which must be an oddity because everyone kept asking me if I was alone, or where my wife/partner/companion was. This got old after a while, but I think that it might be unusual for people to travel alone here.","December 22, 2018","1    Bandara Phuket Beach Resort

90,"We have just returned from Phuket after a 2 week holiday. We are familiar with the Bandara resort standards having stayed at Bandara Koh Samui many times now. Bandara Phuket Beach Resort certainly lived up to the high standards we have experienced in Koh Samui. The Bandara Phuket location is perfect, and sits on a beautiful bay with awesome beaches. Great views across the bay with many activities happening on a day to day basis. The resort is also 5 minutes walking distance to local facilities including Family Mart, local restaurants, pharmacy, taxi services and laundry options.The resort itself is only 4 years old and the facilities including pool top restaurant, beach bar, indoor pool and beach access are amazing. It is very modern and clean, with great access for all ages. We can highly recommend rooms 1114 and 1115 for their ambience, functionality and great balconies overlooking the beautiful bay. Bandara also offer events throughout the week including a seafood buffet and street food night, all of which are reasonably priced. Breakfast is also good and kicks off the day nicely.One thing we have always found when visiting any Bandara resort is the people, and how friendly and helpful they all are. Bandara Phuket is no exception. Led by Manager Sac, the staff are a delight to deal with and nothing is too hard for Sac's people. Sac himself went out of his way to make our stay memorable, and that was also supported by La (our housekeeper) who, despite the challenge of 2 teenage girls in one room always left our rooms in perfect condition. Our visits to the beach were memorable too, thanks to Ja, who is one of the happiest, helpful and polite Bandara staff member we have met. Well done to Sac and the staff. You are fantastic people.Whilst Koh Samui will always be our favourite (we have a ""love tree"" there) we will be returning to Bandara Phuket, to enjoy the facilities, local people, local ambience and culture.Highly recommended","December 21, 2018","1    Bandara Phuket Beach Resort

93,"Bandara is a fantastic place where to stay, in terms of building and outside space. Panoramic pool is amazing, the beach is really nice and the Deluxe room we had was beautiful. The food is cheap and tasty and breakfast is absolutely super to me. Then, unfortunately it happens that you are looking somewhere and you forgot to look at the right direction... these was a dead fly on the bathroom floor when we arrived and after 7 days this morning it was still there; there was accidentally some sand on the TV place and again it stayed here for four days. We took something from the minibar 4 days ago and we’ve been asked if we were hiding the fact that we “stole” the can from the fridge this morning (no, absolutely, simply no one checked the minibar for many days and they just discovered this morning they did not charge us for the drink). Ah, welcome drink is horrible, the worse drink of my entire life. Yesterday night there has been the Seafood night on the beach, food was fine but.. they came at 3,30!!! In the afternoon!! Saying that in 10 minutes they would need us to be away cause they needed to move sunbeds and put around 15 tables with some chairs .... so we just moved to the pool. Just saying, during the dinner, we selected the fish we wanted to be cooked and we came back to the table. After about 20mins we went to the barbecue to check where food was and we discovered that it they gave the seafood to another table (by mistake for sure but.. if you wanna manage something in a specific way you need to be precise and care about the flow) People working as staff are so gentle and kind and we appreciated them so much, they were so warm but really someone needs to organize English courses cause they do not neither understand or talk enough in that language.Probably there are more things I would need to mention but anyway, for the price we spent (50 euros/night having room and breakfasts) the hotel (I would call it hotel cause it is not a resort indeed) is more than fine but in my opinion it could be almost perfect as quality/price if only staff and management would take more care about small things; it could be small but if you put it together with other ones they might become a big matter...","December 4, 2018","1    Bandara Phuket Beach Resort

94,"From the moment we arrived, through until we left we were impressed. The staff are kind, friendly and helpful. Our rooms were spacious, clean and well appointed - the inclusion of a beach bag with towels in each room for the beach was an excellent touch. The rooftop bar and infinity pool are impressive and more formal than the beach area (with friendly bar staff). The shuttle bus service is organised well by the front desk and is very useful. I don't think I have seen a more comprehensive choice for a buffet breakfast. The many choices are monitored and topped up throughout the morning and include fruits, cereal, western and Thai cooked items, fruit juice, tea, coffee etc. You will not leave hungry. The Panwa peninsula is quiet and suited us well. We would happily stay again.","November 20, 2018","1    Bandara Phuket Beach Resort

About 20m at its longest point and 3m at the deepest part and quiet enough to do swim drills if you're into swimming.The only negatives are that some staff don’t speak English (but Google translate was enough to convey ideas), the wifi was dodgy and the drying room is a very small space with a few lines to hang small stuff on it – definitely not your BCD or wetsuit (but this can be hung around the pool where there’s hardly anyone and anyone you do meet is likely to be a diver).

It's near the dive shops, (although really hidden and no taxi driver could find it without our help), the room has a place to leave the equipment and the swimming pool is the best we have seen so far with a really deep part for dive training. On the other hand, for a couple in honeymoon, was a little disappointing. The room is really small, the bathroom is old, there's no separation between shower and wc, the air conditioning was super noisy and the mosquitos were a nightmare. We didn't like the cleaning, we left something on the bathroom floor that stayed there until we left five days later. The staff didn't speak much English, it was hard to communicate, although they were kind. Breakfast was expensive and no one explained to us how it worked.

124,"The Palm Garden Resort is tucked away in what feels like it's own little island while being in town. The resort is very clean and the staff are the best we have ever encountered in our travels. The font desk staff was eager to help and was able to secure transportation for us to the many different places that were not within walking distance. With the foliage and the landscaping, you hardly know there are other guests. We were lucky enough to stay in cabin 106. Right outside our door is the waterfall for the pool. Waking up to the cool breeze, sounds of many different types of birds and the waterfall was natures sweetest alarm clock. While scuba diving and other sports are prevalent, we felt comfortable either sitting on the porch or around the pool reading a book or taking a nap. Probably the most relaxing place we have ever visited. The food variety and tastes were excellent!!!A must see is the Phuket Orchid Farm. This is the only working orchid farm in Thailand. Not only can you walk up and down the rows of budding or blooming orchids, but you get to see some of the prettiest peacocks and chickens. We also toured the Tiger Kingdom. We were able to pet different aged tigers and get pictures with them. The scuba diving, with the Sea Bees, our friend was able to do offered him a very cool experience and some great pictures. For shoppers, there is the Central Festival. There are a lot of shops that you can find in most any American shopping mall. The treat is the different kiosks. We highly recommend a visit to the herbal tea kiosk. The blends are some we have never seen before.Two things to keep in mind. While this is a very touristy destination, there are not your normal souvenir shops, at least not within walking distance of the property. And the beds are pretty, pretty firm!This is a place that I would recommend for anyone needing a true getaway.","March 1, 2016","2    Palm Garden Resort Phuket

128,"This resort is secluded: about 300m away from a main street (where you do find everything, and I mean everything) in a cul-de-sac. So no noise from passing traffic or bars here, which is rather nice and exceptional in the area. The central pool is very clean and pleasant, and it has a 3m depth part to it (this hotel is associated with a diving center). Behind the pool is the massage area, where 4-5 people can simultaneously be pampered in what looks a bit liked a square veiled pagoda. Around the pool and massage parlor is a very well maintained and pleasant garden. Spotless and in our experience the most manicured garden around here. (Of note: at least one of the gardeners does smoke; not pleasant in the otherwise smoke-free resort. Admittedly, some guests also seem unable to understand the global no-smoking signs.)Around the garden are a dozen huts, each with 2 rooms (double/twin). Each room has a small front terrace with 2 seats, a table and a hammock. This is where you see the divers dry their gear. The rooms are pretty basic and functional, though again very well maintained. A very small TV with bad image, a wall airco (efficient, not silent) and a ceiling fan: this is a place to sleep, not linger. The bathroom is really outside the AC area, and the shower is right next to the toilet (no curtain). Very nice hot water and working shower, you just need to master the art of not splashing too much. It actually feels a bit African with the colours, wood and inlaid pebbles.So far, so good. Now for the less pleasant: the breakfast and the restaurant/bar staff are both below standards. Given the association with the diving company (Sea Bees, in the main street close by) you would kind of expect the same quality of breakfast as on the diving ship. Well, unfortunately not. For example: on the ship you have 3 types of bread; here you only have spongy white toast. The coffee is actually OK (as is the soluble coffee on the ship). It is really a shame: just add a few cereal choices, some yoghurt (which was finished by the time we got there), and some real bread, and this could easily be a really good breakfast.Harder to “fix” will be the staff attitude. The two ladies behind the bar seem to share a general lack of interest in both clients and in working. Examples: when bringing you the order of hot breakfast, they do not check for or bring cutlery. When they bring a second plate (portion was not big), the first dirty plate is not removed. Dirty plates and cutlery were removed only 17 minutes after we had all finished. At no time do they come to check if all is OK or if we would like something. All this time, it is not that they are busy: they do sit or stand behind the bar, or in the kitchen. So, no effort to serve or to understand what a customer would like. Also no English skills (but that cannot be the cause, as we have experienced so much better attitude in other places with non-English speaking staff). To be fair, the front office staff is a breath of fresh air compared to these two.I do need to mention that the quality of the dinner was very good: the schnitzel was the best we had on the island, as were the mashed potatoes. The Thai dishes were standard (i.e. good).Two important tips: there are quite a lot of mosquitos (apparently at any time of the day and night: repellent is not offered but conveniently sold on the bar counter: a hidden revenue model?) in the open air restaurant, and the Wi-Fi has strong signal but is slow and intermittent. Both of these again make lingering less attractive in this resort.All in all: the best place to stay if you dive with Sea Bees and have no car, but not really recommended otherwise.","October 29, 2015","2    Palm Garden Resort Phuket

129,"Stayed here during a recent SCUBA trip. This quaint little place is not far off the main drag in Chalong and all the action. The bungalos are clean and gave hot water shower, small icebox, a/c, cieling fan, small patio and a TV. The bed is a pad on a box frame. It may be a little hard for some but it was great on my back. They have a nice pool which was nice after a day of diving or just to cool down. The staff is super friendly and greets you with a smile as you come and go. The have a two for one happy hour from 5-6 which serves up some good mojitos and other beverages. I will stay here on my next trip as I had a relaxing time and great sleep.

Taxi drivers from the airport have a hard time finding this place and there's not a lot of amenities in this particular area of Chalong unless your interested in diving-the staff leave shortly after 6pm so there is no food or drink served after that, it's just what is in your mini bar (which is expensive!)-the electricity went out several times during the thunderstorms and there was some sort of animal wrecking havoc on our roof during the night which made it difficult to sleepN.B. The pool doubles as a diving pool school although the German guy was lovely and the divers never got in our way. There are dozens of shops for diving gear around the corner.All in all a very good, quiet place to stay!","August 5, 2015","2    Palm Garden Resort Phuket

133,"We have been coming to this hotel for a number of years now - usually before and after diving from a live-aboard, but on this occasion simply to relax in the middle of a longish trip around Thailand. It is a lovely place to chill out with a nice garden and a great pool, but don't come here expecting a beach. The food in the hotel is OK, and it is lovely to have lunch sitting at the table outside your room, but we would recommend Dickies Lighthouse (walk down to the sea and turn left) as a better place to have dinner. In general our stay was as good as ever, but the staff are in need of firmer management. The two senior staff we met, Mam and Kaew, were both lovely, professional and extremely helpful. Whilst the other staff were always friendly to us, they had a tendency to spend their time chatting to each other or playing with their mobile phones when the breakfast buffet needed replenishing or there were dishes to clear from the table etc., or sitting around in hammocks and exchanging gossip whilst waiting for rooms to be empty so they could be cleaned - there was simply a lack of professionalism about the place as if the staff have forgotten the hotel is run for the benefit of the guests rather than the them.","March 16, 2015","2    Palm Garden Resort Phuket

135,"Just returned this week from Phuket where we stayed for two weeks at Palm Garden Resort in Chalong. I travelled with my family: two adults and two children.It was hard for the taxi driver to find this hotel. He drove first to Rawai and then started to ask people how to find this place. The road to the hotel looks like there can't be anything for a tourist in the end of the road. But luckily there was.We had a whole bungalow; one room for adults and one for the kids. The rooms are clean but simple and a little bit shabby already. Our shower gave very little water and they couldn't fix it during the two weeks we stayed. So I used mostly the shower in the kids´room. The biggest minus for the room comes from the rock hard mattress. My back was aching every morning.The restaurant in the hotel is very good. The food is tasty and inexpensive and we found ourselves having dinner there many evenings. Also the coctails are good... But breakfast was a different story. Very limited choice and if you don't come early, the fruit and the pancakes are gone. The service in the hotel is friendly but especially in the restaurant not very professional.The best in the hotel is the well kept garden and the nice pool area. I also like massage and they have a very good masseuse who charges 300-350 baht per hour which I find very reasonable.The hotel is located close to in the middle of nowhere so if you are not a diver who spends the days out at the sea, be prepared to pay a lot of taxi fees or rent a motorbike or a car. We had a car for 8 days and it was a good decision.","January 18, 2015","2    Palm Garden Resort Phuket

Usually had breakfast on the boat, but off days ate on the buffet, glad to always see yogurt and fruit in addition to regular breakfast fare. Had several dinners and some lunches here, could get service to the pool or eat on my cool patio. The grounds are immaculate and the rooms are very clean, but be sure to bring your own shampoo as no little bottles in your room. You do get new bottled water everyday and there is a mini-fridge too. Loved the hammock on my patio, great for napping after a massage.

138,"My bf and I just returned from there. We stayed at this resort because it's near Chalong beach where our dive boats depart. We would recommend this if you are planning to dive or prefer quiet than party. It's away from the hustle and bustle, good service, good food and surrounded by nature, that is, mosquitoes, crickets, birds and cats haha! Bring ear plugs if you are a light sleeper!Room has soap bars, towels, tv with cable, good wi-fi, a small balconey, fan and aircon. We didn't like the shower because water was either cold or too hot, must be faulty. You'll have to walk to restaurant for hot water but it's ok coz it's a compact resort.Taxis are more expensive in Phuket than Bangkok. A cab to and fro Patong will cost you 1600baht and 30-40 minutes ride depending on traffic. There's no food nearby but the hotel food, reasonably priced and good can keep you satisfied for a few meals before you crave for something else. A cab to and fro Phuket Town where there are big shopping malls cost 800 baht. You can be adventurous and take a private motorcycle, operated by the motorbiker himself for 200 baht one way. My bf and i squeezed into one and was quite an experience.Overall we enjoyed our stay and paid a good rate.","February 10, 2014","2    Palm Garden Resort Phuket

It may not be within walking distance of the beach, but we were happy to stick to the pool after 2 weeks of the beach on different islands.

The resort itself was beautiful and well maintained and the food was amazing and very cheap. The only bad thing I can say about it, was the location, there are only 2 decent places to go and eat outside of the resort, Pier 42 and Kan Eang@Pier (not your typical Thai prices, but still very good food) This was all that we found anyway.

142,"We stayed at this hotel and the manager Oui was very helpful, courteous and spoke / communicated in English very well. They had another German staff member, a young girl by the name of Beatrice who at times I was shocked to learn was actually a staff member. We arrived at our hotel at midnight, the security guard escorted us to our room. He was very courteous, barely spoke a word of English but was very humble and sincere. In the morning no one called us or checked up on us to see how we arrived and if everything was ok and our welcome drink was never provided - we had to ask for it. So when we went to the front desk, Beatrice was sipping on cola. She looked up at us and we waited to be greeted, failing that, we initiated the conversation by ""well...hello to you too"". She finally got the cue that it's her job to greet people and welcomed us in the resort and tried to explain the breakfast menu. Basically we are entitled to continental breakfast but you can choose to not get that and get other stuff but they wont tell you if you have gone over or under your allocated amount for the continental breakfast meal. We dont eat pork and we stayed there for 5 days and had almost the same breakfast daily. On the third day, after taking our order daily, Beatrice gives us food with bacon. Her incompetence and demeanor was a big let down for us - she didnt care - but the other Thai night shift manager Oui makes up for everything that the German ruins during the day. Oui helped us get a scooter when they had run out and she helped us to book activities and although super busy she always had a moment to spare to customers. The location of this resort is also THE MOST dodgy entrances that we have ever encountered. It is dark, poorly lit, very narrow and there are dogs everywhere. At night, we were afraid to return to our own resort by foot or be dropped outside on the main road by our trip operators!! On the last night, we arrived our hotel from the day's trip to the James Bond Island and were hungry. Fearing the dogs and the dark, dodgy area that this resort is in, we ordered food from the hotel and avoided walking out. We were called to restaurant where the food was left open on the table for us. We ordered two chicken curries and rice.The next day we checked out - and to try something new we ordered something other than the continental breakfast: we ordered from this resort an omelette with mushrooms, and tomatoes, rolled up with cheese on top... all was good until we arrived in Bangkok ... that night we had stomach cramps, got dehydrated due to diarrhea and vomits. We spend that next whole day in Bangkok just being miserable in bed. It took us 30 hrs to recover. Unfortunately for us, Palm Garden Resort with the German staff, the food and its location just left a very negative impression on us.","January 4, 2014","2    Palm Garden Resort Phuket

The restaurant has a decent selection of various foods, and I found it to be quite good. The check in/out processes were both good experiences. A special shout out to the hotel manager, named Oye. While in town, I ate some tainted food and became quite sick for several days. Oye took such good care of me that she was more motherly than a hotel manager. She went far and above any reasonable standard of care. Because of Oye, I will always stay at this hotel when I come to the Chalong/Phuket Town side.","November 24, 2013","2    Palm Garden Resort Phuket

There weren't any blow dryers for anyone looking to dry their hair so bring your own if necessary. The staff were fantastic and provided great service. The pool was very clean and inviting, with plenty of lounge chairs. Breakfast was always superb as was lunch. As a group we tended to go out for dinner after having happy hour at the resort (5-6pm). The only down side is that as a group of 10, meals would take a while to come out as there was only 1 chef. We did end up staggering our breakfast orders which worked out well. Restaurants and bars are within a 5 minute walking distance. Some group members did go for massages at the resort which were reported to have been well worth it.

The pool is large and it was nice to relax there after a full day of diving. Bed was a bit hard but was probably better for my back and we had to keep the A.C on because the room would get very humid and damp. Remember to pack mosquito spray.The manageress is lovely and always smiling, she does everything there and helped us out a lot in booking taxis, recommending beaches and our overall queries.

We wanted to have a drink after one of our dive days and the restaurant was shut by the time we got back at 9pm, which was a little disappointing.If you are there to dive and relax then Palm Garden is a good place since you don't need to wake up so early to meet at the dive centre!","May 8, 2013","2    Palm Garden Resort Phuket

We spent a very relaxing day at the resort, swimming in the pool, eating in the restaurant and enjoying refreshing drinks in the bar.

If you are looking for a few days of relaxation, laying by the pool and being looked after then I would also recommend this resort to you. I would definitely go back!","January 15, 2013","2    Palm Garden Resort Phuket

155,"Having already read reviews on this resort, I was really looking forward to seeing it and was not disappointed. The accommodation, whilst not 5 star of course was more than adequate, beds were really big and comfy! The rooms were cleaned daily and mini bar restocked. My only complaint was that there was no tea making facilities in the room but of course this could be ordered from reception and is a minor drawback when you are staying in such beautiful grounds. The pool was exceptional and we were often the only ones in it, despite visiting at the busiest time of year (christmas). The staff were so lovely and helpful nothing was too much for them. The hotel food was good and very reasonably priced, we ate there several times and were not disappointed. We were also able to get laundry done, hire a moped for the week and there were various trips you could arrange through the hotel. Definitely the best place I have ever stayed in any country.","January 7, 2012","2    Palm Garden Resort Phuket

156,"I stayed for three days prior to joining a boat to sail from Thailand to Borneo so I was looking forward to some rest and relaxation prior to several months of cramped conditions. The resort organised transfers for me and also a scooter for the time I was there. All in all, the service was good with the only downside being the reception desk is closed at night. The room was small but well kept and the gardens well maintained with a great swimming pool. An easy walk to the nearby shops and Chalong. There is no real beach to speak of at Chalong so if you want a resort and beach type location this is not the choice. If you want somewhere quiet and well located to explore the southern part of Phuket it is a good option.","November 22, 2011","2    Palm Garden Resort Phuket

157,"First the disclaimers... this is a ""resort"" in Thailand. If you do not understand that, then you will feel I have given them too high of a rating :) The resort is in the middle of Chalong, a crowded, noisy, dirty place but to get to the resort, you turn off onto what could not be more than a paved goat road and wind your way back till you are convinced you are in the middle of the jungle. They have done a wonderful job with the layout and decor. It's hot and it's humid but it's a tropical jungle! If you stay at the resort and never leave till your plane takes you away, you will have great Thai or German food and exceptionally friendly staff smiling with every chance they get. You can have a Thai massage here on the grounds for the same low price you would find out on the street. Speaking of the street, during the day it is not so bad but at night, the ""bar girls"" are out in FULL FORCE and you cannot walk in any direction without offers of long-time-love. Still, it's not as bad as being in downtown Patong! You can view the layout on their website so no need to describe the pool and rooms when what is really wonderful is the people here. We are here in their low season and they have been very generous and kind and warm. It almost makes you wonder what their angle is (that is my American cynicism coming out). But we have been here 8 days and I could not stop myself from going ahead and giving them a review. The rooms are a little small, and when you leave, to conserve electricity they have it set to shut down when you take your room key and leave. That means you come back to a warm room ...but it cools down quick and is a minor inconvenience for us. We have certainly made new friends here at Palm Garden. They far and away have outdone our expectations. It should be noted that they are a great hotel choice for S.C.U.B.A. divers!","May 26, 2011","2    Palm Garden Resort Phuket

We booked most of our daytrips through the staff and they were extremely helpful. The resort has a lovely swimming pool. It also has an restaurant area where you can mingle with other divers / guests. We used Sea Bees for our scuba dives. Sea Bees is a German company (about 10 mins walk from Palm Garden). They are an extremely well organises and professional company. We did 5 boat dives with them and enjoyed everyone of them. The boats are well equiped and they serve breakfast, lunch and tea during the day. We definitely recommend both the dive company as well as their resort.

163,"I arrived late on and was swiftly checked in and informed I had been given an upgrade. I was taken across to a corner suite room U113. I had thought this great as I had read that with the superior room I had booked sea views were only partial and that the suites had a fuller sea view. First impressions of U113 were good – huge size, double sink in the bathroom, rainstorm shower, large bed, sofa tv – the only thing I couldn’t see was the view from the balcony. I went to sleep and woke up the following morning to find I was ground floor and all my balcony was blocked by large trees. As a result given that I was travelling on my own I asked if a superior room was available the next day and Daniel one of the managers who speaks excellent English sorted a switch to S421. This new room was smaller but perfectly spacious as I was travelling on my own and again had everything I would need including airconditioning, fridge, tv, bath and shower and the view was stunning. Lovely and quiet to given it is the only room the other side of the lift in the building I was in so there was no disturbance from other rooms. Everywhere is within walking distance but I particularly liked the location as I could head straight downstairs to the beach from the S WING and straight through to the main reception from the same level. The longest walk I had was to the Top of The Reef Restaurant and that was no more than a leisurely ten minutes. Breakfast was a large selection and consistently restocked so when I took it I had eggs made to order with bacon and a wide selection of pastries, scotch pancakes and cereal so no complaints there at all. Even when taking it early one morning to get out in time to see the Elephants everything was well stocked. The Food was superb – I ate twice in Top of The Reef where you can choose from a set menu or you can pick a lacarte – the soup with prawns and the rock lobster were superb and I like the added touches including petit fours with coffee after the meal. Service was quick and very well explained when I ordered the souffle which took additional time to cook. The steak buffet in Café Andaman was the only time I ate in that restaurant and it was a great experience with a wide variety of meat and cuts and large buffet to go with it all for a set price. The Chocolate fountains to finish also a lovely touch. I took the bus down into Cape Panwa to try Laem Panwa but for the travel down into Panwa whilst the seafood was good I found the atmosphere a little lacking. My favourite of the restaurants though had to be Panwa House though – the Thai cuisine and seafood dishes were a delight and the banquets great value for money. I ordered one and was given 7 or 8 beautiful dishes and left stuffed a very happy man and then the Tamarind prawns the next time I went were even better. Its location on the beach also makes it a unique place to dine.I didn’t use the main pool but I note with interest now how guests from the sister hotel have been stopped from using it and plaudits to the management team to listening to the feedback from guests on that one. I spent all my time whilst in the resort down on the private beach which was beautiful. When I went the hotel was about half full and as a result I didn’t have any trouble getting sunbeds and umbrellas but I can see in peak season it being very popular. Unlike other posters I liked the fact that Thai law prohibits sunloungers on the beach itself as with them tucked under the trees you get the true beauty of the surroundings more when you wander up and down the beach and swim in the sea. Towels were always available from the hotel and you could take more than one which was great but id argue that during the next round of maintenance some of the sunloungers and umbrellas are showing signs of frequent use and a rolling replacement of those would add more to the experience for guests. Swimming in the sea was fine but previous posters are correct as I would definitely recommend swim shoes as there are rocks and bits of sharp shell as you enter the sea and leave – the rest of the beach is beautiful soft sand. Drinks and food by day were from the Beach Bar and I had lunch there every day. The staff are especially good and friendly here and when you head in are very attentive. I would suggest wandering around to sunloungers more would encourage a greater drinks spend or maybe some system of flags on umbrellas when someone wishes to order. I also felt that the hotel is missing a trick by not offering cocktails by the jug to save multiple trips to and from the bar but a minor gripe.The hotel runs minibus transfers to and from Patong Beach, Old Phuket and Central shopping complex and at a reasonable price so I made full use of those which is a nice touch and can heartily recommend the Green Elephant Sanctuary and the Blu Anda sunset trip around Phang Nga bay (it goes later than others so stops are much less crowded with tourists)Finally the spa is good and I think value for money – I took the Top to Toe massage and found it very relaxingCape Panwa provides value for money peaceful high quality standards and surroundings for those looking for a break and isn’t such a hassle to get to other parts of Phuket – Can heartily recommend and my congrats to management for listening to guests and making progress on improving an already good product. Room Tips _ Avoid blocks T,U and V where possible and take some ear plugs if you are a light sleeper as air conditioning units can make some ambient noise at night that will interrupt your sleep if you are a light sleeperWeather in rainy season 10-24th June – lost two days in 14 to rain otherwise showers were at night. Always a risk to book but one I would risk again","July 7, 2019","3    Cape Panwa Hotel

164,Spent a great 10 days here as part of a luxury escapes. It has all the things a great resort should. Initially stayed in a junior suite but air conditioning stopped so we were upgraded to a full suite no questions asked. Food a was excellent especially at the top of the reef restaurant which I would give 5 stars to. Breakfast was ample and lunch in the café had both Asian and western fixed menus. There are some really super views especially down at the beach which is clean and tropical and where there is another great Asian restaurant. Staff were friendly and helpful and the pool is was super. My only criticism is that there are a lot of stairs when getting around and down to the beach. They do have a tramway to the beach.This is an out of the way place although easy to get to ( about 1 hour from airport) with not much around it.Overall a really nice place to stay.,"July 2, 2019","3    Cape Panwa Hotel

This was a jnr suite Everyone is just so so friendly they all and I mean all what ever their position say good morning / etc to you however many times you see them in the day/eveningThe breakfast (including in our package ) was just amazing - their own egg station where you decide how you would like them and cooked which ever you pick to perfection....So much choice for everyone ( including noodles etc ) bacon sausages ( four different types!)Everything for a full english/ American/Australian/ continental you name it they have it! A fruit station, juices of all kinds fresh tea and coffee ....The food in both the hotel and the beach bar and in all the restaurants in the hotel is varied fresh and just wonderful...Alcohol very expensive ( we had a bottle of Prosecco to the room I think it was around 35 pounds and white wine 27 pounds ...But there is a 7-11 shop down the road which sells everything ( there is a courtesy bus that runs throughout the day and evening to the bottom of the hill and then back again!The hotel seemed really empty - most of the time just the two of us sitting round the pool !Fresh towels everyday for the pool,The service round the pool was great as well - bringing round iced water for guests on hot days which was a lovely touch....The entrance to the hotel is I think the nicest we have ever been in anywhere round the world...They all speak very good English and helped with taxis, markets, trips etc....The room cleaned daily and the hotel is spotless every where...We actually didn’t leave the hotel much as it’s just so relaxing - we went into Patong ( just to have a look) one night and ate at the Hard Rock Cafe - lovely.We did a night market on a Saturday evening ( you can get the bus right outside the reception) well worth going to for your gifts.We also did an island trip for a day which was lovely.It’s very humid there at the moment so be prepared for heat and humidity....But I have to say the nicest hotel we have ever stayed ( we have been to many many countries ) So if you want to be treated like royalty for two weeks and eat wonderful food and lovely fresh smoothies and room service and views - please go there !!!!Last thing about a minute walk from hotel you can get amazing massages for about ten pounds for what ever you want “ Diva” is the name of the place.Also there is a shop that takes all your dirty laundry and washes dries and you collect the next day and it smells beautiful!

After checked in the hotel, we were led to our room. The room is spacious and clean. However, when I get out to the balcony, I was so upset because the view is blocked by trees, like staying in a forest. I could not even see through the trees to see the sea.

171,"My partner and I have just returned from a weeks stay at Cape Panwa Hotel for our honeymoon. Prior to arriving, I had read some negative reviews and was a little concerned as to what we should expect especially as we had gone all inclusive. All I can say is that these reviews were either somewhat exaggerated or the issues appeared to be rectified prior to us attending.Upon arrival at the airport, we were met by our driver and transported to the hotel in aircon and all hassle free. Once we got to the hotel, we were extremely surprised to hear that our room was ready as it was 0930, but was extremely grateful for this and the staff was extremely attentive at going through all services that we had, relevant information and took the time to show us around. We were staying in the Cape Suite and our room was fabulous. The Suite was large, plenty of seating, everything was clean and well looked after. The only issue we had was with the outdoor jacuzzi - we followed the instructions but the cold water tap only spat out unregulated hot water which was boiling. I feel this may have been more user error than anything else. It was also lovely and quiet, the bed was comfortable and massive and it was just a perfect room to relax and wind down in at the end of the day.Pool: The pool was fabulous and right temperature, plenty of sun lounges to go around and there wasn't ""bus loads"" of people coming up from the village to use the facilities like other reviews had mentioned. Some of the sun lounges were slightly stained but they are open to the elements but were by no means in disrepair. My only feedback would be that as there is no swim up bar and you have to go up into the restaurant to order a drink if by the pool, it would have been nice if someone went round every so often and maybe offered people a drinks menu.Food: We had an all inclusive package at a very reasonable price and certainly took full advantage of this. The food at all the restaurants was fantastic, so full of flavour and all dietary requirements were easily met. We also ordered off the menu at times, this was very reasonably priced being at a hotel and also slightly more isolated than in a main town. The tax and VAT may seem large but if pre-warned and if you budget for it, it really is no issue.Activities: As part of our package, we had a day trip to Coral Island which was gorgeously relaxing. We sat on the sand and read our books and swam in the ocean. We were then taken round to the back of the island to go snorkelling and it was amazing going over the reef but it was very rough and the current was quite strong towards the rocks. My husband and I are both strong and confident swimmers as well as divers and even this was just a bit rough for us. We also had complementary massages at the Cape Spa which were excellent, the ladies listened to our needs and was overall just an excellent experience. Overall we had a fabulous and relaxing time as that is what we had planned our holiday for and that is exactly what this hotel gave us. If you are looking for somewhere quiet and relaxed than this is the hotel for you.

Showers hot and powerful.Friendly staff.Good variety of places to eat.Courtesy bus down to the promenade where there are plenty of places to eat.We had a small issue with the dining on the beach, which was no fault of the hotels but they were very good at sorting it out, they really do care about their clients and that’s why we met a lot of people who come back year after year!Barry London is a fantastic Taylor if you need any suits shirts or dresses. shop is just outside hotel.Ming is a fantastic taxi driver+66 (0) 86-948-6300 WhatsApp him","May 11, 2019","3    Cape Panwa Hotel

174,"We are in our last day of our 7 day stay and we have enjoyed Cape Panwa very much. It is a hotel to relax and ""chill out"" as there isn't any real entertainment at night. This suited us as we were happy to enjoy each day down at the beautiful beach and at night relaxing in our lovely Cape Suite which is large, has a huge balcony with a hot tub, a couch and two chairs. We also have a dressing room and a large couch which is great for watching TV The best thing is the lighting. So many rooms in 5 star hotels have very low lighting which makes it so hard to read once the sun goes down. Cape Panwa has magnificent lighting which is such a plus. We have had drinks at most of the bars and our favourite bar at night is Oscars. We also love the restaurant at Top of the Reef which is a 5 star experience and would equal any good restaurant in a large city. We have had lunch at the Bamboo Bar each day where Sandra is a delightful hostess. Their milk shakes are great as are their chips!Breakfast is a buffet in the Andaman Restaurant. The egg ladies are wonderful and make great fried eggs, sunnyside up an well cooked, which is not easy, as well as good omelletes. A bonus is that you can order espress coffee, latte's and cappuccinos.Last but not least, Simon, the General Manager is out and about chatting to the guests which shows he cares how the hotel is performing. We will be sorry to say goodbye to this historic property tomorrow. It has been a delightful stay in every way.","May 10, 2019","3    Cape Panwa Hotel

178,"This is not a bad hotel, but far from being the 5 star exclusive hotel as described on the website. We booked through Kuoni, being one of four hotels during our two week holiday and this was the poorest of them all by some margin. Some of the good first,- the beach is really nice, being a hotel beach it is not public (although it is shared with a cheaper sister hotel)- Great views (on the south side)- Friendly staff and helpful concierge- Usually plenty of sun beds by the beach, pool beds get busy after 09:30- Good taxi service- Rooms are large and refurbished ones are nicely doneWhere the hotel needs to improve to meet it’s description:- A lot of the external furniture was tired and dirty, Sun beds stained, parasols broken- We were provided a room with a view of 4 four Mobile masts and the local housing area. After complaint they did move us but we met a couple of families with similar stories- Service is nowhere near a 5 star facility. Examples include, There is no service at the sun beds, plates were never cleaned away at breakfast, you were offered one cup of coffee at breakfast and had to badger busy staff to get another, the towel porters were rarely at their post and the one on the beach was plain grumpy. Empty glasses were left all day by deserted sunbeds. On our first evening meal we asked for a table to be pointed at one free at the other end of the room and the waiter walked off. This was genuinely odd as everywhere else we went the service was excellent and smiley!- We paid for an upgraded room with a jacuzzi on the balcony, but the water was brown, it kept overfilling and bits of the jacuzzi were missing (the cushions). We complained at were eventually not charged for the upgrade.- The one piece of sailing equipment was a catamaran. It was broken, not useable and looked as though it had been like that for a very long time.- There is a main shipping lane within swimming distance of the shore (I quite liked this but others may not)It was a genuinely odd experience as it felt that it had once been a 5 star exclusive hotel but it needs investment in numbers of staff, staff training and facilities.

179,"We stayed here for 7 nights as part of our tui multi centre Thailand private tour. It’s a beautiful hotel, with fantastic rooms and wonderful staff. If you are staying as part of a tui package I can highly recommend room t303 which has excellent sea views. We were given full board which we used only 1 night and a few lunches but this could be used on the set menu or towards the a la carte (450 baht for lunch or 800 for dinner) at any of the restaurants. Only reason we didn’t use more is we love eating out but the food was delicious that we did eat and service we received was excellent! Especially the lady who works at the bamboo bar, she provided such friendly and welcome service remembering my drink order every morning etc! The otter bar is a beautiful sunset spot! We had no problems at all with sun beds as other reviews say. The staff were amazing at arranging drivers for us we did a lot in the week including visiting big Buddha, patong beach etc. Overall I can highly recommend this hotel for a relaxing week in the sun. A few recommendations for the area: baba nest for sunset drinks, sun and moon for sunset drinks, the cove for dinner, brasserie yacht club for sunset drinks, patong beach for a night out, and we also did a day trip with let’s go phuket for an early bird prang nga bay sunrise and janes bond island tour which was phenomenal small group tour (max 8 people)","May 2, 2019","3    Cape Panwa Hotel

182,"We stayed at Cape Panwa Hotel with our 3 year old son and my parents. We booked a LE package to celebrate my mother’s 60th and travelled during our son’s birthday. Upon arrival in Phuket we were picked up by the airport transfer which was nice comfortable and air conditioned. At check in we were created with a cool refreshing drink and the news that the hotel had upgraded our room to one closer to the amenities to make it easier with our three year old child. This was hugely appreciated. In addition the hotel delivered a complimentary birthday cake to help us celebrate our sons birthday. This absolutely made his day! Thank you! The hotel is beautiful situated on the beach with a handy tram to take you down the hill. The pool while busy always seemed to have somewhere for us to relax and oUr son enjoyed swimming here daily! During our stay we ate at Bamboo Bar, Cafe Anderman, Panwa House and top of the reef. The steak and seafood buffets were definite highlights but the food quality was fantastic at all the restaurants. This is the second LE trip with have done to Thailand and our previous experience was that the hotel food was very westernised and a bit bland, this was not our experience at Cape Panwa. Our recommendation to anyone looking to stay here would be to make sure you book a table at the smaller restaurants or during the busy nights (eg themed buffets). During our stay we participated in a number of activities including doing the Cooking Class and a day trip to Coral Island. We highly recommend doing the cooking class. The chef was excellent at explaining the ingredients and theories behind Thai cooking and it was great to come away with our own aprons and chef hats and over 30 recipes. The Coral island tour was included in our package and it was fantastic. My parents also did a Phi Phi island trip but enjoyed the coral island trip because it was so much less chaos. The spot we snorkelled was fantastic as we swam through huge schools of fish. The staff at Cape Panwa always were happy to help us out and assisted us with a number of enquires throughout our stay. The hotel also has a free shuttle that goes down the hill into the little village. Overall we had a wonderfully relaxing stay at Cape Panwa Hotel and would highly recommend staying here if you are looking for a family holiday in which you just want to relax with the family at the resort. Thank you Cape Panwa Hotel staff for making it an excellent experience. We will for sure be back and next time we will bring more of our extended family to share the experience.

184,"This place was beautiful and is recommend it if you just want to do nothing because that is what you get. It's a remote little place with a stunning beach and they supply many many sunbeds to accommodate everyone. However there are not enough sun shades so if you don't get there early enough you will burn to a crisp. Even though some families had 4 or 5 sun shades to cover 3 beds, they are needed but there not enough to go around. You do get free canoeing though which is a bonus when you get bored just laying around the beach. The room service is top class, we had fresh bedding and towels everyday without fail. This place is very clean and reception are extremely helpful. I said I wouldn't go again but only because there is nothing much to do here unless you go out to town somewhere. The entertainment is virtually non existent so each night we ended up in our room with drink from the local 7/11 as the drinks in the hotel were extortionate. £18 for half a bottle of wine. Don't go here thinking it's going to be cheap because it's not. It's more expensive than at home in UK. The hotel did offer a shuttle bus every 20 mins down to the main restaurants but the prices there are around the same. ","April 25, 2019","3    Cape Panwa Hotel

185,"After reading a lot of negative reviews on Trip Advisor, as any normal human we had some reservations.However we could not have wished for better holiday facilities.We stayed in a family suite over looking the back of the hotel, it was beautifully quiet (apart from the abundance of birds), with a large balcony with panoramic views of the sea. With a separate bedroom for the children, sitting area and 2 bathrooms, plenty of space.Good points- every meal wonderful (not one upset tummy) and very helpful with my daughter only able to eat gluten free. Also a really good variety across the different restaurants.- beach area fabulous, lots of sun beds & very clean. Beach area did have coral under foot, but i didn’t need need to wear beach shoes & Bamboo bar lovely as so were the staff. (Especially the lady manager (sorry not got her name)- pool area, sun beds available without problems (or people reserving them!)- banquet nights, good value and popular (advisable to book).- shuttle bus down to the village very reliable & very frequent. (Worth a trip, variety of good restaurants & market stalls, shops & cafe and try the Sunset Bar)- Spa, wonderful (cheaper options down the hill) but luxury and worth the money.- trips desk - very helpful & got very good advice (Phi Phi Island book the early tour)- hotel management visible and often asked how our stay was. All staff friendly (laughing & joking together enjoying their work). As do the live music team, always a smile.- great hotel taxi service, safe & reliable.I could go on.Improvement points- plastic straws, please change to paper to help save our environment (as so many used).- suggestion, drinks service order around the top pool.Would we return to this hotel - definitely yes!!!Great holiday.","April 22, 2019","3    Cape Panwa Hotel

When we checked in after travelling for a long time we were given fresh drinks, refreshing towels and made to feel extremely welcome, a very lovely touch.We stayed in a family suite which was amazing, the hotel had arranged for a lovely decoration ready for the day we arrived, due to it being our anniversary. We also received a lovely decorated cake on the day of our anniversary which made it extra special.The hotel has it’s own private beach, and two lovely swimming pools. We enjoyed spending time at the beach and the beach bar (Bamboo Bar). All staff were very attentive and looked after us especially Jirasak T.The hotel has lots of lovely restaurants both on site and at it’s sister hotel Kantary Bay, which can be reached using the hotels shuttle bus. We enjoyed eating at the Cafe Andaman and the food was great, we loved the steak and seafood nights. The service was great especially by Jennifer.Our favourite place to eat was at the Top of the Reef, the food was exceptional and Asaree was the perfect and attentive maitre de.We were lucky to be staying during Songkran, the Thai New Year. The hotel provided a fantastic day incorporating the traditions of throwing water at a beach party during the day. In the evening there was a brilliant show and Thai buffet with a wide range of food to meet all our needs.Overall the hotel is beautiful, we will definitely be back. This hotel will always be a part of perfect memories and continue to be part of new ones. Simon the manager also made us feel welcome and he was always around checking guests were okay.

187,"I recently stayed at Cape Panwa for my daughters 30th birthday (April 2019). We were a party of seven, ranging from 7 years old to 55. The hotel itself is based on the top of a steep hill, in a quiet location which actually suited us as it’s somewhere tranquil to return to after a busy day touring. There is a free shuttle bus which takes you to the bottom of the hill to the sister hotel which is based in the small village. The village has a few money exchange shops along with excursion shops, an ice cream/cake shops and many restaurants. There is also a Seven Eleven shop. The village livens up in the evenings and even has a street market where you can buy stuff to take home. The shuttle bus stops at around 11.30pm and runs frequently and the drivers are extremely friendly and accommodating. So back to the hotel.... the junior suite we stayed in was in block V, the rooms are big and clean even though we had lots of ants in the room, but I guess being that we stayed there at the hottest time of year and we are around a lot of greenery it’s expected. Our views were not bad, but that was mainly because we were on the 4th floor so could see the sea in the distance, but in reality we were overlooking the back car park. The balcony was a good size, but we didn’t use it as there was a sign warning us about the mosquitoes. You get daily complimentary water, and tea and coffee in the room, but everything else you would need to pay for. The fridge in the room worked well, but is stocked with the hotel goods so very little room to put your own stuff in. The reason why I didn’t give this hotel a higher rating is that the room itself looked tired, the bath could do with changing etc. Also the room does not come with an iron or ironing board. The cleaning of the room was not that great, lots of dust around, but I guess that is a matter of opinion. We were bed and breakfast, the breakfast was ok, nothing amazing, lots of choices but repetitive. They close breakfast at 10.30 and they really do mean that if you come down at 10.30, it’s too late everything starts getting packed away. There is a nice beach, but gritty so bring beach shoes. there is a beach restaurant which serves nice lunches and cocktails, ice creams etc. There is also a lot of jellyfish in the water so be careful. I think Thailand in general has a lot of jellyfish. The pool areas are nice and you get free towels, get to the pool early to secure your deck chairs. Towels and chairs could do with a freshen up as they are tired looking. The staff are friendly.On the negative side, we arrived at the hotel very early in the morning after travelling for 20 hours (including our stopover) and was told that we could not have breakfast which was disappointing, especially as when we left we had an early morning flight so could not have breakfast on that day either. We did receive a breakfast box on request when we was leaving but it was filled with stuff we didn’t eat. So we felt we were cheated out of a breakfast. On the positive side our rooms were ready although one of the rooms was unsuitable because it was a double bed and they wanted twin. Some of the rooms also smelt damp. There is no lift on the 4th floor, so we had to take the lift to the 3rd floor and walk up. Also from the main lobby to our rooms you have to walk up a huge number of steps. There are no lift access so you have no choice. We raised this with the staff and was told that we would have to change the grade of the room to move nearer and that would come as a cost. I read on here that people were offered free upgrades but that was not offered to us, even though we were told and it was obvious that the hotel was not full. I guess if your face doesn’t fit, you don’t get offered. I also explained that we were there for my daughters 30th birthday, and nothing special was offered. Overall it’s not a bad hotel, it’s average compared to other hotels I’ve stayed at. There is room for improvement which is why I believe my rating is fair.","April 21, 2019","3    Cape Panwa Hotel

191,"We had our wedding at the Cape Panwa Hotel and Spa on their wedding terrace. It was such a wonderful, beautiful place to celebrate our wedding.The hotel staff and particularly our wedding planner, Aom, not only managed to accommodate our special requests but also exceeded our expectations many times. All of that was while wearing a calm, pleasant smile and giving us the feeling of being cared for. We exchanged hundreds of emails with Aom starting about 9 months before the wedding date. She was always responsive, answered our questions and showed us available options. Once we arrived there, she went over the details of the wedding arrangements to make sure the wedding would be according to our plan. We felt more assured and relied more on her for coordinations. We are very happy of our wedding venue choice. It consisted of 3 different main sections for our ceremony, dance party, dinner and two smaller sections for serving cocktails and dinner buffet. There was no need to move the furniture around and re-decorate every section during the wedding. We had 37 guests but the venue has room for more people. The dinner buffet was tasty, generous and with so many options including bbq on the spot. The flower decoration was spectacularly beautiful and according to our color choice. Our guests have been taken care of with 50% spa discount. I was completely happy with the work of the hair dresser and makeup artist which Aom brought for bridal hair and makeup. Two days after the wedding we chartered a Cape Panwa yacht to visit Krabi and Railay beach area with our guests. The yacht was beautiful, crew were kind and the trip was well arranged by Aom and became a memorable and fun experience for everyone. Overall it was a great experience for us.

194,"We were really excited about having a week stay in this hotel. But as soon as we arrived it was apparent that the hotel was more 3star. The staff were rude, no smiles and made us feel awkward in the bars and restaurants. We stayed in a delux junior suite, this was very dated, dirty and looked like it needed re decorating. The block in which we stayed resembled a deserted high school- not the holiday luxury interior you expect. The resort is on mutlitple levels, which are in need of repair (many holes in slabs dangerous when walking) with poor lighting, it makes it difficult to navigate where things are. It also gives the impression that the place is huge but you soon realise that you have to walk down the hill to the main strip to use sepperate hotel restaurants and bars. (Very very steep hike) Also the beach was very dirty. Around the bay is a large oil refinery and shipping container yard, which makes the water very polluted. There is dead coral covering the beach. Very sad and sharp. We did not bath in sea. Which we have loved while in other parts of Thailand. A week there was exhausting and we expected more.","April 11, 2019","3    Cape Panwa Hotel

195,"We have stay here a few times now & always had a wonderful relaxing time. In mine & my Mrs opinion it has got to be one of the best hotels on Phuket. It not a modern hotel but it’s one of those hotels that captives your heart. We have advised friends to come here & they have also loved it to.The things that make it special are the very friendly staff who always seem happy & to see you. Also the private beach with the bamboo bar & the staff who always remember what you drink make this hotel a special place. And in all the years I’ve been coming here I’ve never had a bad meal the food at any of there restaurants is excellent & the staff are so attentive. The breakfast at Cafe Andaman has a vast selection to cater for everyone , I personally love there made to order omelettes with onion & mushroom filling with a side order of crispy bacon. In all my visits to Cape Panwa I never really had any problems until this visit & it was just a slight problem with the jacuzzi but after a personal visit to our room from the GM & the guest relations manager the problem was quickly & very professionally sorted out. It’s reassuring to know that they value there customers so highly to do a personal visit. I can not wait to visit Cape Panwa again in the future. I could not recommend this hotel enough it had 5 Stars off me","April 11, 2019","3    Cape Panwa Hotel

196,"Apologies for the delay in this review, however better late than never.After reading the latest reviews of the Cape Panwa Hotel, including so many negative ones lately, we have been prompted to review our 7th stay at the hotel.We are by no means elderly travellers, and nor are we package tour travellers. We come to stay at the Cape Panwa because it fills all of our vacation needs. We have always found courteous staff, good food, a good selection of drinks, comfortable rooms, great surroundings and a superb management team.We do have to agree with some of the negative comments surrounding the use of the Cape Panwa facilities by the Kantary Bay guests and the shortage of the sunbeds around the pool and at the beach, which we have seen on all of our previous visits. People staying at the Cape Panwa have paid a premium for the use of these facilites, and so, in our opinion, should get some preferential treatment.We would also like to comment on the 'relaxed' dress code that is now allowed in Top of the Reef. We don't agree with shorts and thongs being allowed to be worn here. It was disappointing to see during our last stay. Is it really too much to ask that men put on long trousers and shoes/trainers in the evening for a meal in an upper-class eating establishment? It was the only restaurant in the hotel where that was required! There are plenty of other places to eat if you don't like the dress code......Yes, food and drink in the hotel is more expensive than eating and drinking outside the hotel, but in our opinion, it's not really expensive compared to hotels at home. I really can't believe that people come away on holiday and expect to survive on a few pennies!We look forward to our Cape Panwa holiday every year, and plan accordingly. If you don't like what the hotel charges, then don't use their services!We only ever stay on a bed and breakfast basis, and choose to eat in the hotel restaurants for many of our meals. Generally, breakfast is excellent, and removes any need to have lunch. If you are peckish, food in the Andeman Cafe is very reasonably priced and is prepared fresh to order and is very good.This trip, for the first time, we used the hotel airport transfer service, which worked superbly for us. No worrying about taxis, or having to deal with 3rd party transfer companies, and you can charge to your room.Our room (the same one we have every stay) was excellent as usual. A well appointed Cape Suite with a great view over the garden, down to the beach and sea. Housekeeping was a little hit-and-miss this year, but the room was generally kept clean and tidy, with fresh water every day.Staff were fantastic. We'd especially like to thank Olivier, Varoon, Jenny, Somchai, Asaree and Yamila for making our stay special. You guys are one of the main reasons that we come back every year to celebrate Sharon's birthday!We stayed for 3 weeks in October last year, and Olivier was caretaker general manager during this period. We can't thank him enough for all he did for us in the run-up to our stay and during........ He would be our recommendation for a new general manager!We ate multiple times in Top of the Reef, and as usual, all the food that we ordered was superb, served with excellent service from Asaree and Yamila. This is definitely our favourite place to eat. If you make use of the dinner vouchers, you can really grab a bargain meal here on certain nights of the week. We always have a-la carte on Sharon's birthday, and even this, we consider, doesn't work out too expensive! It's lovely to eat here and have the staff make you feel special.Yes, we did have trouble on some days getting sunbeds around the pool. And yes, we did have trouble on some days getting sunbeds in a good position on the beach. But we're not the kind of people that travel all that way to let something so trivial spoil our holiday. If you're patient and you wait, the sunbeds do become available!Maybe because we travel in October and not in peak Thailand holiday season, we don't see so much of the issues highlighted in some of the recent posts. We certainly have never seen anyone with a cool box or with unbearably loud music playing either around the pool or at the beach.The Cape Panwa has everything that we look for in a holiday. It's far enough away from the hustle and bustle of Phuket Town/Patong to give us a quiet relaxing break, yet not so far away that if you want to go shopping/touring, everything is only a short taxi ride away. The staff are polite and attentive, the food and drink is reasonably priced and the rooms are comfortable. All set in a tropical beach paradise. What more could you want?We've already booked again for this year, and can't wait to get back to our favourite place on earth!See you all soon.Sharon & Jason.","April 6, 2019","3    Cape Panwa Hotel

197,"We first stayed at Cape Panwa in 2012 and always planned to go back. We arrived this time on a hot humid afternoon, and were welcomed with cold towels and drinks. We were impressed with the lovely renovations that have taken place since our last visit.We were delighted to find we had been upgraded to a Cape Suite C303, that also came with a jacuzzi. Our suite was waiting for us, lovely views over the ocean. It's hard to find fault with anything to do with this resort.We came back from dinner to find a beautiful birthday cake in our room, to celebrate my birthday. A lovely gesture, it's really the little things that matter.Breakfast is on until 1030, great if you want an extra sleep in, and the food fresh, and varied. The staff at the resort are continuously attentive, nothing is too much trouble. We visited the walking markets in Phuket Old Town, with transport arranged by the reception staff. Return shuttle was 400 baht for two.The resort is perched high up on a hill, with an extremely steep incline and decline into the Village below. To this end, there is a shuttle that runs between the resort and the beautiful village, where you'll find restaurants, a brilliant coffee shop, a mini market and lots of street carts during the high season for nightly markets. The beach is lovely and shaded with many coconut tree's and beach umbrellas to go around. You may want to pack beach shoes to swim in as there is a lot of coral on the sandy bottom. You can walk the stairs to and from the beach, or take the little shuttle that runs every few minutes up and down. The beach bar has had a lovely upgrade and is very comfortable. We had a late flight and were given a generous late checkout of 1400. After this, we were settled into the Cape Panwa lounge and made comfortable with drinks and snack until our transfer to the airport arrived. We want to fund new places to visit when we travel to Thailand, but we will always return to Cape Panwa, before we come home. Thanks for having us!","March 29, 2019","3    Cape Panwa Hotel

198,"This must have been one of my best stays. Unfortunately only for a week, wished it was longer though. We stayed at the property most of the time, we did not venture out much as we so much needed a break from work. And a perfect break is exactly what we got. Could not fault the extensive breakfast, the steak night buffet was amazing, and I enjoyed the Thai night in front of the thai restaurant on the beach (forgot the name). The hotel is quite far from Patong, so we only visited for one evening, but that was more than enough... not really our cup of tea. We spend most of the days on the beach (view of Phi Phi in the far distance!), there are plentiful sunbeds, and the coconut trees provide ample shade. Just perfect for a week of doing as little as possible. Big thanks to Dan from Guest Relations and Ms. Sandy from the Beach Team for the great care.","March 25, 2019","3    Cape Panwa Hotel

199,"TERRIBLE, EXPENSIVE, POOR QUALITY. 3.5 STAR AT BEST !!!We have just returned from a two centre trip to Thailand with the second part at the Cape Panawa Hotel. The first part at the Sands Hotel Kho Lak (Beautiful hotel) However as for the Panawa not the same. On our arrival we were shown a superior room which over looked an electricity transformer with views over the bay of cranes and Silos with a dated bathroom with shower over the bath. The second room they showed us was the same. In the end we had to pay £300 to upgrade to a cape suite room which was lovely and looked the other way over a beautiful beech. However the Hot tub on our balcony didn't work. This hotel has a swimming pool next to the reception area with only 45 sunbeds !! which is no where near enough so you have to be early to get one. The sunbed mattresses are old and dirty with sweat of other guests. The parasols on the whole were either dirty, broken or both. This was the same at the beech area. Also no adult area so noisy with children. The staff in this hotel are generally miserable don't smile much and unhelpful. They don't come up to you around the pool to ask about drinks and we found this the same in the otter bar too. we asked for a couple of cocktails to be mixed which are everywhere else in Thailand but told if its not on the menu you can't have it !!You have to go to them for drinks etc that's if they can spare the time from generally talking or doing nothing. At one point when I was going to the toilet from the pool restaurant a waitress grabbed my arm and said you haven't paid !! Everything in this hotel is also very expensive approx 40% more than the Sands in Kho Lak and they put a 10% service charge on absolutely everything so you feel like you're being ripped off. If the staff want to see how to run a 4.5 Star hotel I suggest they visit The Sands Hotel Kho Lak. The only positive thing `i can say its in a beautiful setting but that's where it ends !! Wouldnt go back.","March 21, 2019","3    Cape Panwa Hotel

200,"If you have read my previous reviews you will know we have been here before many times so this is an update to changes, some good and others, not so gThere are many regular retruners including ourselves so that in itself must tell you this is a good place to visit and and they do domething right - so why the dissonance and the dropped star?This is fabulous hotel, run by many many wonderful staff we call friends. There is nothing the staff won't do to sort out niggles for you, or just make your day special with their ever smiling helpfulness. However, over the years there have been several different management changes which affects everyone within the hotel group as head office tinker with the resort's rules. Unintentionally, this sometimes spills over and as a result changes that affect the staff and the guests. There were niggling issues such as the 'complimentary meal voucher' actually only allowing you to spend a limited amount - usually one course from the al la carte or the huge set meal but nothing in between was allowed whic was starngeThere are still issues with people reserving too many beds and sunshades and tables on the beach leaving others with none; or resreving poolside beds with towels and then going out for a couple of hours. It would be helpful (and fair) if these were celared every 45 minutes or so. But generally, the old saying should apply ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it."". In other words if you tinker too much then you will put people off staying at this resort. Surrisingly we have noticed how many people seem to take the shuttle down the road in the evening rather than eat in the excellent house restaurant which seemed oddly deserted except at breakfast and on theme nights? Also, fewer people eat in the excellent ""Top of the Reef"" restaurant since the dress code was relaxed - too far in our opinion? We like to dress up for a high quality meal - not sit as we did, next to a table of four wearing shorts and flip flops. Casual dining is good in the right place but not in the evening at ""Top of the Reef.""In summary, we are going back again next year and hope there aren't to many changes especially if it disturbs the harmony of the best asset you have - your staff.We look forward to one promised change in the near future. Following the example of many resorts worldwide the hotel intends replacing plastic straws (which end up in landfill / the sea) with paper straws. Excellent. So whilst on the subject of saving the panet, the hotel might consider changing the shower taps by the pool and on the beach with push button taps, so that water is not wasted by guests too lazy or unwilling to turn the taps off after their shower. So much wasted running water.See you next year - we hope!","March 21, 2019","3    Cape Panwa Hotel

201,"We stayed for 4 nights in March at the end of a 14 day tour of Thailand with 8 hotels in total. We would recommend it. Here are some key points to help you decide on whether you want to stay here.1. Hotel on top of steep hill, courtesy bus down to sister hotel, seafront and village. 2. Wide steps through hotel gardens or funicular tram down to private beach. 3. Beach very tidal, tide came right in, leaving approx 6ft of beach. Goes out a long way and leaves a lot of rocks/coral exposed making swimming unadvisable at low tide. Timetable in room advising of swimming times approx 2.5 hrs either side of high tide. No sunbeds on the beach, they are all in the palm trees at the back of the beach. 4. Beach a lot more popular than pool. 5. Andaman cafe is the main restaurant. Buffet breakfast with everything you can think of and a la carte lunch and dinner with set menu options. Varied menu of both Thai and western food. Food quality good. Often trio on a night singing, Beatles, Simon & Garfunkel type songs. Which gives a clue to the age groups. 6. A range of nationalities and age groups with some young families but the majority over 60 if not older, with many as long term returning guests. 7. The hotel does look quite old from the outside with the blocks of rooms and the photos from the 1980s and early 90s of all the stars that have stayed there. All the public areas are decorated to a high standard with quite heavy dark wood furniture. Our room block R the room itself was well decorated and facilities modern with USB ports, mini bar etc but the bathroom let it down and looked tired and dated with shower over bath, dirty stained dark wood surround to sink, old fashioned taps, dirty grouting and plug hole. 8. If you have a late flight you can get a late checkout and/or use the gym showers and air conditioned lounge with complimentary drinks and snacks whilst you wait. Just over an hour taxi from airport. 9. Hotel offers for a small fee a shuttle bus to Phuket town and Patong area and also has its own boat going across to Coral island which we can thoroughly recommend. 10. Top of the Reef restaurant very nice, more fine dining. Choice of set menu or a la carte. Can work out a bit pricey if you have 3 courses with wine circa £100 for 2. 11. Otters bar has happy hour 6.30-7.30 2-4-1. We went most nights, Shame there weren’t more people in there as most there for pre dinner drinks before Top of the Reef or for happy hour. The girl singing on the piano was very good. 12. Went to the lighthouse bar, no one in there. 13. Can also use facilities, restaurants and bars of sister hotel, Kantary beach. 14. White plastic beach bag in room to use. 15. Mini bar well stocked with reasonable prices, you need to sign chitty if you want items replaced. There is a Seven 11 supermarket in the village if you want to get your own supplies. 16. View from our room block R was over the port and oil refinery. You do get cruise ships coming in and also container ships and tankers. Other blocks looked more over the beach side so they wouldn’t have seen the port. 17. Plenty of restaurants in the village if you are only on B&B and don’t want to eat in the hotel every night, also market along the front that has plenty of food stalls if you fancy some street food.

202,"We returned home at the weekend from our 3rd visit to this lovely hotel. The setting is beautiful, rooms are great but it’s the staff that make this hotel. The welcome is genuine, all staff are good. But there are a few who go the extra mile these are Jennifer and Nanthaka at breakfast, the ladies on the egg station at breakfast, Sandy on the beach, Simon and Thidarat in the Lighthouse, they all seem to know what you want before you do!All restaurants especially Top of the Reef serve excellent food. I was disappointed to not see Mangoes at breakfast (if you’ve never tasted Thai Mangoes trust me they are the best) unfortunately Simon (GM) Pomelo does not compare. If you want peace, relaxation and excellent service this is the place to come.Thanks to everyone at Cape Panwa for another excellent holiday.

203,"As you read this review it will be in contrast to the many hundreds of glowing positive reviews. So why is our review so poor? We don’t write negative reviews easily, however we hope by reading our review other independent travellers will not be let down as we were. This probably rates as one of our worst holidays and has served as a huge learning curve for us as independent travellers when using the hotel website as a sole reference tool in making a choice of where to stay. We had also looked at this site too and found in the whole only excellent five star reviews. Furthermore Trailfinders in the UK, whom we have used frequently, have it in their brochure for Thailand, so although we didn’t use them this year, we felt it would mirror what we, as independent travellers look for. What however is displayed on the hotel website is far from the reality of the hotel once you arrive. The website It reads (alongside some cleverly taken photographs) as follows ….“For the past three decades, travellers, royals and celebrities alike have stayed at Cape Panwa Hotel and found their own slice of paradise in this quiet corner of southeast Phuket.One of the first luxury establishments in the area, the Cape Panwa Hotel defines tropical grandeur by blending superbly with the surrounding natural beauty while providing excellent service, stylish sea facing pool villas and an exclusive beach.”The reality The only truth in this is that the hotel is indeed, in the south east of Phuket and that it probably WAS one of the first luxury establishments. This is not a slice of paradise. While it is in a beautiful location, what you find once you get here is a slice of mass cheap package tourism. Travellers are not royal or famous, (not that we expected to find that,) but we did not expect to find the hotel overflowing with holidaymakers from the cheap, rundown budget two star sister hotel, at the bottom of the hill outside the hotel. THE CAPE PANWA HOTEL WEBSITE DOES NOT MENTION THAT THE HOTEL SHARES ALL ITS FACILITIES WITH A BUDGET HOTEL! Had we known that the already small and busy restaurants, beach and tiny swimming pools with very limited sunbeds at Hotel Cape Panwa, were also open to ALL those staying at a third of the cost if not less, at the rundown hotel at the bottom of the hill, we WOULD NEVER EVER HAVE COME. At 7 am the hotel shuttle bus connecting the Cape Panwa and sister budget hotel arrives up at Cape Panwa full of those staying at the Kantary - the sister budget hotel. Beach When we arrived we tried to find sunbeds on day one at the beach and at the pool, when looking lost at the lack of space or sunbeds, the budget hotel tourists shared with us, that “they arrived at 7am and took the beds “. They also told us that most of them were staying at the hotel for 10 to 13 weeks. They said they have been coming coming for decades! Where else they asked us, can you get five star facilities for two star prices. They said they “ had it made!”Our hearts sank. Surely this couldn’t be? We had come for a restful seven days of beach at a five star hotel and here on day one, we were being told that a budget hotel shared all the facilities. The reality of this sharing agreement is even worse than initially imagined. What becomes quickly apparent is that the budget hotel guests who have been coming for years, are on first name terms with the staff at Cape Panwa and over the years have established how easy it is for them to have the run of the staff and the beach, by tipping the staff for the best sunbeds! By 7.30 am the budget hotel holiday makers have arrived kitted out with large cool boxes full of lager and sandwiches and packets and packets of cheap cigarettes. So the reality of our holiday is that for seven days we couldn’t get a bed at the beach and on the two occasions when we did, it was cramped and right next to someone. Most of the sunbeds are shockingly stained, old and dirty. Thai law dictates that you cannot have sunbeds on the actual beach, so all the beds were pushed back onto the gardens under the palm trees.This afforded you some shade, but also meant that the view you had was of someone’s cool box or a picnic lunch from the sister hotel and bottles of lager. Not really what one would expect from a luxury five star hotel to be honest! Beach towels are often threadbare and old. We also discovered a new trend here on the beach and at the pool. Brightly coloured jumbo clothes pegs to keep your towel in its place. Looking around we often wondered if this really was a slice of paradise in Thailand or some kiss me quick seaside resort! Although we knew we were not in a kiss me quick resort when we saw the warning sign for box jellyfish found in the sea at the hotel’s beach. The small main pool. There are only 48 beds for over 200 rooms before you include the mass of budget hotelGuests arriving daily at the main pool. The 48 beds by 8 am were all taken. Hard to stomach when they were taken by those not even staying at the Cape Panwa hotel. Families who couldn’t afford Cape Panwa prices were staying at the budget hotel. Yet came and took up all the beds at the pool. They brought ball games and noise so any quiet reading time at the pool was non existent. SmokingThe smell of smoke in the hotel is everywhere especially at the pool. A specific table and chairs to smoke at, unbelievably, are situated right under the breakfast tables. The no smoking signs are disregarded anyway both at the pool and at the beach. BehaviourNo one monitors any behaviour at the pool. Loud music, smoking, sunbeds bagged at 7 am, were all common practices. Security Security is non existent and at the entrance to the hotel anyone can walk in. It is literally open to everyone, as is the pool, so anyone from anywhere can just walk in. We have never seen anything like it in years of travelling.ManagerWe asked to speak to the manager on several occasions and ended up emailing him to make an appointment to speak to him regarding all of these issues. We asked him, where on the website did it say that all the hotel facilities were shared? His answer is that indeed it doesn’t mention this sharing facility anywhere.The facilities for Cape Panwa hotel are not large enough for the number of its own guests, far less for all the additional people who come up on the shuttle bus. There are some very clever photos on the website but the reality is that the two pools are very small pools and cannot cope with hundreds of guests, far less guests from another hotel. StaffThe staff at the beach and at the pool mainly ignore you, but will pamper to all those tourists who have been staying for years. We found this quite frustrating. Not only do the sister budget hotel guests bring their picnic lunch with them and hence no revenue to the hotel, but the staff were slipping them a free coffee and tea! Which other five star hotel allows cool boxes of food and drink to be brought in? We got to know only one member of staff who made any effort to speak to us. His name was Varoon and he was very kind and very attentive and he was at the very small main pool. Overall we would have to say that the staff are hit or miss and the majority make no effort to welcome you or ask about your stay. Breakfast Arrival each morning at breakfast was met with “ sit where you want” No one even asks for your room number so even if breakfast isn’t open to the sister budget hotel, nothing stopped them from coming in and filling the restaurant. Most mornings we had to go and get our own tea or coffee from the pots which were at the middle of the staff’s serving station. Service was poor although the actual breakfast selection was good. The roomWe had a Cape Suite and we found it to be comfortable. It has a very large bed and we found the room to be quiet and we slept well. The room is large. Limited tv channels if you wanted to catch a movie. There is a safe in the bedroom, a large fridge and kettle. Our roomHad a nice view over the bay. The suites on the other side from us overlooked the naval port and oil refinery so not very nice at all. We did of course pay a lot more to have this level of room, and were dumbfounded to discover from the majority of the other guests who had traveled with TuI and at least staying in the Cape Panwa hotel, had been upgraded to the Cape Suites free of charge. We now have a much better understanding of all the very positive reviews on TripAdvisor. These are written mainly by tourists on package holidays who come and find themselves offered an upgrade to ensure a repeat visit the following year.Room ServiceWe ordered room service once which was average. We ate several times at Laem Panwa which was good. We ate a couple of times at Top of the Reef and found it to be excellent, yet while a meal for two with wine was over a £100 those next to you eating the same food paid with dining vouchers from their package holiday. All very strange. Cost of drinksWe didn’t find the cost of drinks expensive as other reviewers have stated. If you’re talking about being a luxury resort then these are the prices to expect.Upkeep of hotel While we were there there was constant drilling hammering and painting. We weren’t surprised because the establishment needs so much work done to bring up to a reasonable standard that we can only imagine that this work will be ongoing for several years. Excursions We booked several excursions while we were there, simply because by 10 am we couldn’t get sunbeds at the pool and we could not bear to stay in the resort. The plan had been to have seven days in the “slice of paradise.” The reality was we tried to escape it as often as we could. The first tour went to James Bond island which was very good, the second tour was a wake-up call at 5 am with a breakfast box and a trip to Phi Phi Islands. The hotel staff forgot our wake-up call, so we missed the tour.The Spa This is lovely. Massage with oil is good. It is true that there is a massage shop just a few metres further up the road and prices are a third of the hotel spa. However the two really cannot be compared. One is a shop with rows of beds. The other a beautiful spa. So we would recommend booking in the Cape Spa and paying extra. Complaints We listed all these complaints to the manager. He himself is new to the hotel and told us that he himself had made the same observations as we had and passed them onto his boss. He reassured us that things will change in the hotel. ChangesThe budget hotel clients will no longer be able to use the swimming pool is. However they will continue to be able to use the beach. It is hoped however that the beachfront rows of sunbeds will be kept for the Cape Panwa hotel guests who are paying the premium prices in the actual hotel where the beach is. It is planned also that the shuttle bus will arrive later and the masses of budget hotel clients arriving early to take all the beds from the pool and the beach will stop. Some form of distinguishing between the two hotels needs to be made and controlled, otherwise other independent travellers will continue to write negative reviews for this hotelFutureUntil Cape Panwa sorts out what kind of hotel it wants to be, what is its true identity, and what kind of tourist it wishes to attract,our recommendation without any hesitation, would be to choose another hotel! At present the majority of those staying at the Cape Panwa Hotel are pensioners looking for some winter sunshine who don’t leave the hotel and are on full board. They write glowing reviews because this hotel meets their needs as package holiday tourists. The negative reviews like my own are written by independent travellers like ourselves don’t buy into package tourism and look for the “ slice of paradise” which this hotel wrongly advertised. Why should you book this hotel after reading our review?If you are looking for a cheap holiday,among many pensioners, reasonable food, and if you are happy to share your hotel with others staying at a third of the cost in another hotel…. and getting up at 6.30 am to grab a sunbed, then Cape Panwa is for you. We asked for a refund. This was not given and we were offered a free meal and spa treatment. Cape Panwa Hotel would do well to update their website with immediate effect and remove even the lead photo on tripadvisor as it is not of the main pool. Would we return? Sadly no. We have now contacted ABTA and trading standards.","March 13, 2019","3    Cape Panwa Hotel

204,"1st time at the Cape...Lovely scenic location.Superb room...1 of the best we,ve ever had...Upgraded to a Cape Suite on L block room 111.The breakfast was 1st class, the staff were excellent & very helpful.The swimming pool was in an excellent location & well supervised by the staff especially Varoom what a character.We liked the entertainment at the Lighthouse bar till 1am supervised by the lovely Simon certainly a one off as a waiter.Why haven,t I give it a 5 star..... For 2 reasons....1 is for us the location was too hilly for easy access to the beach or to the reception especially in heat over 36 degrees.Secondly there,s no easy access into the sea... Unless you wear sea shoes or have a lilo you cannot just walk into the sea with confidence due to all the rocks,stones,shale etc.Plus there,s no easy access from the beach to the hotel swimming pool.A week later we stayed at The Haven in Khao Lak that had these last 2 comments & we found it a lot easier.So to sum up Cape Panwa is a lovely hotel with lovely staff.. Would we return... Sadly no.","March 12, 2019","3    Cape Panwa Hotel

207,Really difficult to find any fault with this hotel.We had a Junior suite with lovely sea views -it was spacious and comfortable..The private beach was very pretty and the sea was so warm.We had our lunches at the Bamboo bar which served up delicious Thai food and Sandy and the staff there were always very helpful and happy-I noticed that when they were together they were laughing and joking among themselves unlike some hotels. There was no loud music and no one trying to animate you all you hear is the sea and the birds.The Breakfasts were very good fresh fruits and plenty of other choices.We liked to go to the Otter bar in the evening and have the 2for1 drinks before eating at the Top of the Reef which was always excellent with good service.As other people have said the drinks are quite expensive(can of beer or glass of wine is about £5.80 with the tax and service charge).We had several excursions out which were all good especially feeding and washing the elephants and the baby! Finally some praise for Tui -we were 4 hours late back to uk because of an aircon fault on the aircraft. I clained compensation on their website and 8 days later received a cheque in sterling for 600 Euros each so the EU have some good points!,"March 4, 2019","3    Cape Panwa Hotel

Food at the Cafe Andaman and Panwa House was superb, the Otter Bar great for a drink, particularly 6.30-7.30 for happy hour! Use the massage parlours just a short walk from the hotel, Jasmine we found particularly good, authentic and great value for money. Taxis are cheap, use them as well as the shuttle buses to get to Phuket Town, the temples and the weekend market which is a must do if you like street food etc. We will return one day!","March 2, 2019","3    Cape Panwa Hotel

209,"Checked into a fantastic dual aspect corner room with sea and a view on both sides with huge balcony for a week of total relaxation. Had spent four nights at their sister hotel; Cape Kudu beforehand so was expecting a nice stay. Spent a day at the pool, and the rest at the beach as there was a breeze for most of the morning and shade provided by the trees during the lunchtime sun. There was also the infinity pool down there which was good for cooling off. Bamboo bar provided a nice spot for an hour out of the heat at lunchtime. Breakfast buffet was good with plenty of choices and never too busy. In terms of the evening, we didn’t try any of the restaurants in-site as too much choice in Panwa. Otters bar was great for sitting and looking out of the sea each evening though especially when happy hour was on. All in all, a fantastic week of sun, massages and eating but ready to move on to our next location.","February 21, 2019","3    Cape Panwa Hotel

The efficiency of staff was appreciated - they checked us in early, booked a taxi for us for the next morning, one to take us to Monkey Hill, drew landmarks on a map for us with eateries, night market, old town, souvenir shops, shrines. It was all we needed. In the morning we came down earlier than arranged and they immediately called the taxi and told him to come. Taxi prices are set and there’s a list in the hotel. To Phuket airport 650 (allowing 1 hour to be safe). Return to monkey hill 500. Pool looks nice but didn’t get a chance to use it. AC wasn’t the coldest but fine for sleeping. King sized bed - firm and prob the comfiest hotel bed I’ve ever slept in! Hotel itself is beautiful and location is ideal, it was quiet despite the noisy night market downstairs.

They were too bone idle to change us (obviously) because we saw people booking in some three hours after us.Also the noise. (we had seen a post in this regard but .....) Did not expect to be positioned directly opposite a Rasta Bar that played boom boom music till 1;30 in the morning. The double glazing they told us about did not stop the noise at all.Also just loved the positioning of the safe in the room.

Upon arrival, the staff at Casa Blanca treated us like nothing short of royalty.

After the market we walked back to the hotel, checked in and realized that our luggage had already been taken up to our rooms. Our room was beautiful, spotless and they had gone through the trouble of pouring us ice cold refreshing drinks along with some fruit. Shortly after getting settled in we went back down to the lobby where April hooked us up with a great deal on a tour of an elephant sanctuary for the next day. She booked this for us some time after 10PM, don’t know how the heck she got in touch with someone at that time but they made it happen.

The building has a distinct European colonial look to it and this vibe carries on throughout the building. Reception treated us like royalty during check in. The main reception area is beautiful and has places to sit and relax as well as a nice coffee shop. We were taken to our room which was wonderfully decorated and had an old fashioned charm about it. There is an elevator but we walked up the gorgeous staircase in the middle of the hotel. Room was immaculately clean as was the bathroom. AC worked perfectly to give us a great nights sleep in a comfy bed. Hotel is right in the middle of the arts / artisan district and the streets around the hotel are full of old colonial style buildings painted in bright colors. Lovely area to walk around and close to the museums and night market. Check out was smooth and we had a lovely breakfast in the coffee shop before leaving.

Additionally, they provided great recommendations for everything from shopping to history to food. The pool is small but secluded and felt great after hot day exploring town. They gave us the option of two rooms due to it being low season and my wife is a sucker for a balcony. This balcony was especially nice with the terrific view that it provided. It was more noisy due to overlooking the street but this has never bothered us and they do provide ear plugs if needed. If you are looking for a quieter room ask from one off the front of the building. In short excellent hotel, staff, and location. If your go make sure to hit up the “Indy Market” for some great food stalls and live music. Will stay again if I make it back to Phuket Town. ","August 8, 2018","4    Casa Blanca

243,"My partner and I arrived at Casa Blanca in old town Phuket after spending 2 nights at Patong. We felt instantly relaxed and charmed by the beauty of the entry hall/lounge/reception area. It is a small space but tastefully furnished and decorated with beautiful orchids. The colour scheme in white tone matched with grey and navy blue sofas and matching patterned floor tiles bring a world of class to this charming and cosy boutique hotel. We were warmly received by the staff and fortunate to meet the manager/owner of Casa Blanca who helped us with our check in process. The service was efficient, friendly and professional. We could not find any fault in the service. Every single one of Casa Blanca staff has a smile on their face and happy to assist to make sure we have the best experience during our stay at Casa Blanca and Phuket town. Our room has windows that opened out for ventilation (should we choose to do that) and overlooks the central atrium garden below. The mattress is nice and firm for a good night sleep. It was quiet during our sleep on both nights with the occasional sounds from the rain pouring down onto the glass rooftop above the atrium. And, we love listening to the rain. It gives an authentic sound to an old colonial style building. I love the old style lift with iron gate and wooden door. We were on the 3rd floor, which is the highest. But we used the stairs mostly, which is strategically located within the central atrium to take in the beautiful garden vista of the wall garden, water fountain and garden bed below. Casa Blanca has a good location in the old town. We were there in the weekend and had the chance to experience the Sunday night street market, just around the corner of the hotel. Thanks to Casa Blanca’s staff, especially Adrian, for giving us all the right recommendations on things to do, see and eat.  ","August 7, 2018","4    Casa Blanca

248,"We stayed as a family for a night at Casa Blanca. Though it was a short stay, we felt very welcomed. Alvin dropped us an email a day ahead to check if we needed anything. He was very prompt in his replies. Both he and Giorgi were most helpful in sharing information about places to visit and restaurants. Casa Blanca is at the heart of Old Phuket Town with restaurants and museums within walking distance. They were very honest with their recommendations and being folks who like to experience local food, it was a great experience. We were very lucky to be there on the last day of the food festival. There were lots of great local stalls as promised.We got a family room and the rooms were better than expected. I love the architectural details and design. It shows a lot as a place which has been well taken care of, right to little details. The rooms were clean. Overall, it was a great stay.","June 6, 2018","4    Casa Blanca

253,"This quaint little hotel was a perfect place for us during a recent visit to Phuket. We opted to stay in Phuket town to get a little more local flavor than the beach hotels. We weren't disappointed. The hotel is lovely. We had a big room overlooking the street as we'd requested a balcony room. The bar across the street stays open late and is pretty loud. The hotel offered to switch our room but we found that with the windows closed we could sleep just fine. (And with the heat, we preferred to be in the AC). Our room was spacious and clean. For a quieter room I'd suggest requesting something overlooking the interior garden. The staff was great. The service excellent. I'd stay here again.","May 7, 2018","4    Casa Blanca

257,"We stayed at Casa Blanca a few nights and absolutely loved this Portuguese-style hotel! We were so lucky and got a 3rd floor courtyard-facing room; so charming and quiet. The room was a good size and the air conditioner kept the room cool as the temperature outside climbed into the high 80s. The staff were so friendly and helpful, even when I had to request extra help when I accidentally locked the safe incorrectly. The staff were also very knowledgeable about the surrounding area and pointed us to points of interest (bars, where to buy wine, temples, which markets to visit and where to find the best food). The staff do not accept tips but you can leave one in a general tip box where money is distributed equally among staff. Our room and the hotel in general was very clean. Inside the lobby, there is small cafe where one can get a latte and small bites (bagel with cream cheese, sandwich, yogurt). Throughout our stay, we were constantly in awe of the simple, yet detail-oriented, design and decor of Casa Blanca. From the hand-picked orchids in the lobby, to the artwork, to the well-maintained ivy in the courtyard, to the unique in-room decor, the attention paid to detail was exquisite and greatly enhanced our experience.

265,"Stay at Casa Blanca was a unique experience. A nice, quiet and cozy place located bang in the midst of Old Phuket town which is replete with a lot of history. It has a total of 17 rooms.Casa Blanca has been designed on the lines of a Spanish colonial Bed and breakfast, complete with a small inside garden which is sky-lit like many of the similar Spanish structures. There is an old style small elevator which requires its steel concertina door to be pulled close before it will move akin to what you saw in the blockbuster Hollywood movie “The Titanic.”The premises is tidy and neat, well kept and decorated with a lot of Spanish artefacts and other beautiful pieces and most of them come from the General Manager, Ms Yodying Giorgi’s personal collection. At the time of our visit she was away to Bangkok.The place is managed by a very warm, polite and courteous staff which is always ready with their honest opinions and ready smiles whenever you approached them with a request. They go out of the way to help with complete patience every time. They even have ready photostat maps of the old Phuket to explain you the history and the nearby places of interest.I would fail in my duty if I didn’t mention a few persons with whom me and my wife interacted during our stay at Casa Blanca although there was very little time with us but they left their mark and I must mention appreciate what I noticed. Needless to say, this extraordinary team is making a difference in making Casa Blanca a place worth every pie you pay for your stay here.It was particularly great interacting with Vics, a Combodian citizen who has otherwise worked previously in Bangkok too. He readily and honestly shared his opinions on everything that you wanted to know or what he knew and understood. After our first hectic day, I chatted with him for a full hour almost post midnight in lobby and was impressed with his simplicity and outlook to life. I met Renz, the efficient supervisor the next day. Ever smiling, this 28 yr old is a Scuba Diving instructor too. Impressive attitude and eagerness to help makes her popular amongst the guests. I must mention April and Alvin. April is always full of laughter and moves about energetically dealing with number of issues at a time. Alvin a sober smart lad too is focused and attentive to every detail.The overall rating that I give to Casa Blanca is 5 out of 5 simply because it is worth every dime that you spent here. Located in the heart of all activity, Multi Cuisine eating points, restaurants, Massage Centres, handicraft shops and other merchandise, street food and night markets are all within a stone’s throw.Only disadvantage, you are away from the beaches and night life if you are the Party Type of the wild variety.","November 25, 2017","4    Casa Blanca

285,"Hotel is not big with just over a hundred rooms, but that's the beauty of it...swimming pool was not busy (maybe June is not peak tourist season?), and there was hardly anyone in the gym. We stayed in one of the rooms with pool access and really enjoyed the convenience. This was not a sight-seeing trip for us so we spent most of our time in the hotel by the pool.Pros:- Staff members were friendly and helpful or at least they would try their best to help.- Rooms with seaview get a good view of the sunset, so you don't really have to travel out of the hotel especially to enjoy the magic moment, if you are into watching sunsets.- The team members of the SIP pool bar were friendly and attentive, with special mention going to Min. With verbal communication being limited outside of Thai, they did try their best to help.- Food was not poor nor exceptional in general (with the exception of their Calamari, it's a must-try!!!). Still acceptable if you prefer not to travel.Cons:- Staff members had very limited language ability outside of Thai.- The hotel was a little far from the centre of town. There weren't many restaurants around the area. They did have a shuttle bus service during the day to Kata Beach, but there are only 6X to and fro.- Water pressure is too low especially in the shower. The bath tub's shower head All in all, I would recommend the hotel if you are looking for a relaxing vacation with family, or as a couple. I would return in the future.","June 12, 2019","5    The Yama Hotel Phuket

314,"Arrived from Chaing mai same graded hotel. Service we received in Chaing Mai far greater. We ordered a steak meal each as we arrived at 7pm and the hotel is outside of the resort so we thought we would eat here as too tired to find somewhere to eat. My husband's steak was full of fat and could not cut through it so we said it was inedible and they replaced it. The 2nd one was very bad also but he had no choice but to eat it as he was hungry, I ate my mine but not great. I advised it was really bad and thought I should not pay for it. But because of the lack of English they call the reception and a lady came down and we had a discussion with all of the staff standing there just staring at me and making me feel stupid she then offered a free taxi to go in the resort to eat, of which we declined as we were so tired. FOOD POOR SERVICE DISGUSTING. Hotel very clean and the rooms are lovely. It is too far out of Kata but if the courtesy bus rang past 4.30 pm I would say it would be ok. We paid our bill this evening with no discount and it has been our worst and most expensive meal for the last 10 days so summary the hotel is ok just don't eat there, and staff need to be more attentive and give much better customer service.

Overall the rooms were clean and the bed was comfy however you could tell it needed some maintenance. Bedrooms, bathrooms and balcony all very good size.The breakfast was sub par with very limited choice and the hotel restaurant is not great/expensive. The staff were rude and very inattentive.The common areas of the property needed maintenence and were not clean. The pool area is very poor, unmaintaned and they have very uncomfortable pool sun loungers. The hotel is around a 30minute walk into town and agree with other reviews the hotel should put on the shuttle service later into the evening (only runs until 16:45) as the staff and shuttles are just waiting at the front door! We also adheared to their “eco programme” which meant we didn’t have our bedding our towels changed for the 3 nights of our stay however we were told by staff that we were ineligible for the cashback due to having the do not disturb sign on...

We waited 10 minutes but we got it in the end. The cocktails were just so so and taste a bit weak. We went to the roof top to have happy hour drink and watch the sunset. It was nice but please update the music. The roof top bar has a lot of potential but man the music is from the 80s. Breakfast was just ok but for the price of the room, I won't complain. The room was really nice. Aircon worked very well. The bed was super comfy. The shower has a very strong pressure which was fantastic. I will stay here again for sure.Oh almost forgot to mention that the staffs were amazing. Pam at front desk is so nice and helpful. Jip (I think that's her name) she is the sales manager was so kind to stop and chat with us and asked for our feedback. The security guy was really nice, he arranged a good parking spot for my large 1000cc motorcycle and kept an eye on it for us the whole stay. He always try to chat with us and give us recomendation of where to go and what to do around Kata. There was also a nice young bartender who served us at the pool and then again at roof top bar too.

323,"Good breakfast buffet, nice clean rooms. Originally they accidentally put us in a Mountain View when we had a deluxe sea view but we caught it and they quickly fixed that. One morning we ordered breakfast to go for a tour for 6 am but they didn’t have it ready and our tour waited 10 minutes for it. At times there was a language barrier with the front desk and that made it difficult. And if you need to convert money at the front desk (it will be a bad exchange rate, but we knew that) be sure your dollars are absolutely perfect or they won’t take it. It wasn’t a bad stay by any means but wasn’t an over the top stay either.

324,While it isn’t the most convenient location (1.5-2 km from the beach and you don’t want to walk it) the hotel was very nice with a picturesque pool and a very nice small gym. I would recommend getting a scooter if you stay there (they rent them but you can get cheaper down at the town) as you don’t want to try walking there at night along the Thai roads (dangerous) and the taxis to get anywhere on the island are horrendously overpriced (they offer a shuttleTo the beach but that seems like a hassle).The first and second floor poolside apartment are awesome as they have their balconies flooded with water that feeds into the poolAs a water feature. Very relaxing to hang out there. I managed to get the stat heavily discounted through an online booking and paid just 1500 baht a night as opposed to 8000 and was very happy with my room and the facilities.

328,"Ok hotel but don’t feel like coming back. Want to be nearer to the beach and restaurants next time. Best thing was the sunset view!LocationHotel is quite far away from the beach, restaurants and shopping if you don’t want to spend money on taxi.Hotel is on a hill and there is a very busy heavy traffic road you need to walk if you want to go somewhere.BeachHotel has free ride to and from kata beach couple of times per day. You have to reserve it beforehand and ring to the hotel to let know when you want to come back. Airport transferTaxi to the airport costs 800-1000bahts.Hotel surroundingsNothing special in the area.Lovely sunset view but that’s it.PoolOk pool but dirty. Lots of hair floating around. there is one area in the pool where there isn’t water. Just an empty hole. Weird.Gets noisy if there is lots of people in the pool area in the same time. Few sunbeds. Not enough for all.Hotel restaurantSince there isn’t much other restaurants around you might eat here. Ok food but not very high quality European food. Didn’t taste Thai food. Pizza was like frozen pizza with ketchup on bottom. Salmon was good!WiFiWorked ok in the room and other hotel areas.Breakfast/foodBasic breakfast. Nothing special. No bacon. Omelette station. Some fresh food and vegetables. If you come late in the last breakfast hour. There can be very little food left and egg station is closed.RoomsClean nice big room.Cozy bed and enough pillows.BathroomSightHad a pool access room. You have to climb a ladder to get to the pool. So if you have challenges to move this is not your room.Air conditioning Worked ok.BalconyHad two plain chairs. Would have been nice to have something to lay down in the balcony.Cleaning Safety deposit boxFree of charge and worked fine.Bathrobes slippers you have in the room.Shampoo/conditioner is available also and vanity set.Gym was ok. Didn’t use the spa.","March 6, 2019","5    The Yama Hotel Phuket

332,"My partner and I will be spending our last night at the Yama hotel tonight with a total stay of 4 nights. We have found the staff to be quite friendly which is a big plus. The hotel has a nice pool with a very relaxing atmosphere. As many have mentioned the hotel is about 2 km from Kata beach which as young travellers we thought would be an easy walk but it is quite dangerous to cross a very busy 80km multi-lane road and once crossed, you walk alongside a narrow road with no footpath with trucks and buses passing. It is especially dangerous to walk in the dark hence certainly not recommended for children or the elderly. The hotel provides a shuttle only every 2 hours from 10am with the last shuttle leaving around 4.30pm. A taxi to the beach was about 250 baht (about $12.50 AUD) which is an absolute rip-off for a 2km ride but all taxi services are very expensive in Phuket. Our room got upgraded to one with a pool view with the bed being quite comfortable and the aircon was quiet and worked well. The temperature of the shower was temperamental and at night there was a lack of light in the room making it difficult to sometimes find things especially in the safe where only a torch was provided. Breakfast is OK. English breakfast is lacking with no bacon, hash browns or muesli. Also would have liked a coffee machine. All in all a very relaxing stay and great staff but would consider staying in central Kata next time.","February 27, 2019","5    The Yama Hotel Phuket

333,I visited this hotel with my 9 year old son for 1 week. The rooms were of a good size and clean. There was a paddling pool in the balcony with was an expected bonus. We got into a moped accident a few days into the holiday. The staff were amazingly helpful. They took us to the hospital to get treatment and bought us back 3 times. We were also offered a complimentary meal coz we weren't mobile. Highly recommended. Will be going back next year.,"February 27, 2019","5    The Yama Hotel Phuket

334,"We struggled to find a hotel to the standard we want, and then found via Agoda this hotel and booked direct. (Tip # 1) As it was our first visit to Thailand and Phuket we wanted to get this right. We were not to be disappointed. We were booked in for 6 nights and enjoyed it immensely. It’s a great hotel with international guests, we’ve noted about 9 different nationalities while here (including us Irish) From the minute we walked in the welcome we got (especially after traveling 19 hours) was amazing. A beautiful kiwi based drink (even at midnight) was great to have. Please can we have the recipe!!! Our room was as we saw when booking. Contemporary and stylish, minimal and spacious in equal measure. We chose the hillside room, which overlooked the main road, and at times was noisy to be honest even with the patio doors/double glazing. This isn’t the hotels fault but something to factor in with jet-lag! We bought the inclusive breakfast and there is a great selection of juices, cooked to order omelettes, eggs and small pancakes, and the standard pastries, and a vast selection of breads and fruits more than enough to set yourself up for the day. The pool area was perfect, in fact, we have never spent as much time at a pool as here, especially as we have a 9-year old. Very safe, great view and pool side bar provides all you need. The lunch time offers are reasonably priced, but they are more expensive than going out to the local street food stands or equivalent restaurants but worth it to be fair. The location of the Yama is set in the Kata Hills, and the only disadvantage to this location is the limited local amenities. The hotel is separated from Kata by a dual-carriage road, which the traffic is very very fast. We recommend TIP #2 and you get a free workout too! The hotel does provides a shuttle service between 0800-1700, so for going out you do have to contend with parting with 500 THB or negotiating a very fast road. You do need to book in advance (Tip # 4) While you will be told its only a shot walk, we watched for locals and others walking down and rarely if any saw any. Getting about is the area is great, but limited to walk from hotel. We went to Phuket and Karon, and used the shuttle and then got the local bus (40 THB = €1.20) to Phuket, and used GRAB (Tip #3) to get back 550 THB (€16.50/£14.20* see Tip #5)The staff are amazing, we cannot fault them, so representative of the Thai people. They want you to have a great experience and they do not fail. I ordered one night in the restaurant tuna which I wanted to be cooked right the way through. Unfortunately after 2 attempts this was’nt to my satisfaction, and the staff were very concerned and genuinely upset I was irritated and disappointed and allowed me to change, plus they did not charge for the meal I had. Needless to say the meal cost was given to the staff as a tip! They were excellent. So, in summary, a great hotel, a great find and a most positive and memorable first experience of Thailand. it’s definitely for those who want to be away from the more frantic beach area, with great views. Independent travellers will enjoy it, and for getting around consider a car hire or moped (of course latter not suitable with a 9-year old). Thank you #teamYAMA TIP 1: always #bookdirect for best prices TIP 2: Take the walk UP the hill (Turn left out of the hotel) and follow road around to get to traffic lights (which seems to work on special days) to cross and find some local restaurants (Try the Koi restaurant, basic but amazing food) not only is it safer than walking along the road, you get a free work out. TIP 3: Download the GRAB app, its the UBER of Asia, and you can see where taxi’s are locally. For info the taxi price from Phuket is broadly the same as going to Kata village – there seems to be a 500THB minimum (€15) TIP 4: Book your shuttle slot the day before to avoid disappointmentTIP 5: Use a curve card, it’s an overlay card which you select which takes the money from whichever account you want and there is NO currency exchange or transaction fee) download the CURVE app in Apple/Google PlayStore and quote MDZZYV3D to get £5 equivalent free.","February 26, 2019","5    The Yama Hotel Phuket

337,Booked 5 nights on the false pretexts of the reviews on Agoda where guests are lured into giving 5 star reviews in exchange for a free cocktail/ free taxi to the beach which by the way is a 20 min walk.  We arrived from staying in Patong at a beachside hotel which was also around the 100 pound per night price- we arrived to this hotel having higher expectations due to the higher reviews. We are extremely disappointed so far here- this is our 2nd of 5 nights are currently considering leaving early. To name a few disappointing aspects 1) The room we booked was a deluxe mountain view which was stated in Agoda to have a bath and shower. We arrived and there was no bath. It had cheap fittings and floor was dirty and the room had a damp musty smell- possibly from the bathroom with its poor ventilation. (Photos attached to prove these descriptions)2)The cot which we paid for 25 extra per night (as stated in their Agoda booking conditions) was dirty and mouldy. I refused to allow my 1 year old daughter to sleep in it. This got changed once I complained. (photo attached)3) the check in was stated at 2pm- we arrived just before 1 pm so went for a walk around. We arrived back at 2pm but still had to wait 15 mins for to get our room card due to only 1 working receptionist. 4)the food at bar was costly and bland. We ordered a pizza and a Thai curry. The curry was decent however the pizza was vile. It was Luke warm and was just a ready made crust with added toppings. The pizza cost 320 baht with added 10% service charge is about 8.50British pound. Overpriced. 5) due to the location being so far from beach area I find it very displeasing to be staying in a hotel (supposed resort) and not being given a comfortable free transfer to downtown area. To be given an open truck which you are expected to be carted down like a zoo animal with our child is disgraceful. THIS IS AN OVERPRICED HOTEL WHICH PEOPLE NEED TO AVOID UNTIL A NEW HOTEL MANGER IS APPOINTED. HE/SHE WILL NO DOUBT LEAVE A REPLY BELOW WITH FALSE PROMISES TO TAKE COMMENTS ON BOARD AND TO OFFER SOME FORM OF APOLOGY.. WE HAVE LEFT SIMILAR REVIEWS ON AGODA AND FACEBOOK..... didn’t lower ourselves to give dishonest reviews for freebies. Shame on the others that have done this. Have reported this to Agoda as it’s not a legal practice.,"February 9, 2019","5    The Yama Hotel Phuket

340,"We have recently spent 6 nights at the Yama. Overall the hotel is of a high standard and modern bedrooms and comfortable beds. The pool was nice and there were plenty of sun beds with fresh towels available from the pool bar. The bar is a little expensive however just outsidethe hotel there is a small shop which is quite cheap for beers and snacks. Breakfast was average with an omelette station however don’t both asking for a soft boiled egg as they just can’t get It right. My wife even did a translation on Google and it still did not come out right, but that’s just a small moan. The hotel is situated about 1/2 a mile off the main road up a steep bank so you need to be good on your feet is you are venturing out for a walk. There is a free bus 6 times a day starting from 10 am down to Kata beach with the last return at 16.45. In summary a very pleasant place to stay. I would stay there again but if you are travelling around Thailand as we have done I would probably only stay there for 2 to 3 nights.","January 31, 2019","5    The Yama Hotel Phuket

Breakfast variety is good, but not giving you the wow factor. Increasing the quality if they want to maintain this variety would be better.

342,"I stayed at the Yama Hotel for a few days after being in Patong Beach a few days as well. Yama is situated off the beaten path and up on a hill. I had an incredible stay! My view from the balcony was beautiful. I could see the sunset every day and the Big Buddha as well. Buffet breakfast was cool. I had no complaints. The attentiveness of all the employees was impeccable. I was surprised with a birthday cake from the staff at breakfast one morning. Since I was alone on my birthday, I thought this was a great sentiment on behalf of the hotel. The room was really clean and modern. It was a good size room as well with soaking tub and separate shower. Lastly, I had to give Yama a great review for helping me out. I headed to the airport on my last day & left my camera in the hotel driver’s auto. By the time I noticed, the driver was almost to the hotel about an hour away. I immediately emailed them. They were able to retrieve my camera and coordinated with me to have it shipped back to the USA for me (at a cost of course). Nevertheless, I was appreciative. They could have told methey didnt have it. I would have lost all my Thailand memories. So thank you so much! Would definitely stay here again!! XOXO","January 28, 2019","5    The Yama Hotel Phuket

The hotel is away for the crowds at kata and Karon, providing a peaceful escape. The downside is that there is barely any restaurant/ shops nearby and you ll often have to venture back out to kata beach/ Karon for food.

349,"Flew down from Bangkok after booking a Superior Sea View room. I have stayed in Phuket several times before and this hotel was on my list to check out. I wasn’t disappointed. The hotel is modern with a beautiful design, and has beautifully designed, chic modern rooms. The Superior Sea View room has a balcony with two chairs and table with a view of the ocean and the tree-lined hillside surrounding the hotel. The Yama Hotel, as it is actually called and known locally, is indeed not on the main strip along the beach as other reviewers note. But as a result it is removed from the commotion and noice associated with the throngs of tourists along the main strip along the beach, and offers a regular shuttle service to and from Kata beach. So for those looking for a more peaceful stay at a beautiful hotel that offers incredible value for the cost (especially if you’re booking through Agoda for a price discount), then this hotel will suit you well. But if you’re looking for a hotel that’s right on the beach, then The Yama Hotel May not suit your preferences. The hotel has a fitness center, spa, and also offers car, motorbike (Honda Click and Honda PCX 150), and motorcycle (Honda CBR 500) rentals, for people who want to have their own wheels. Overall this hotel is a new favorite of mine.","January 14, 2019","5    The Yama Hotel Phuket

350,"It is a hilltop hotel, even with a shuttle service, it’s challenging to walk to Kata Beach. You have to cross a busy, dangerous, downhill highway with no pedestrian crossing. We did this the first day and it was harrowing. It is a 20 min. walk to Kata beach. A trip to Patong is a pricey 500 Baht, one way. I understand what the owners tried to do with the pool with its rainfall design, where there are several water spouts placed from the second floor balconies. Literally from the floor of the balconies. The chair legs on the balconies were on water. I can imagine a myriad of things that can get into the pool, coming from anything on the second floor balconies. I did not get into the pool at all. The water looks clear, but I decided not to get in.The food was above average, though the chef was hands-on, proactive where he met and checked on guests, etc. it is a good hotel for family with kids. For a less noisy room, reserve rooms on the 2 upper floors.","January 14, 2019","5    The Yama Hotel Phuket

352,The hotel is clean and pleasant. The rooms are lovely and comfortable. The location is not close to many places. The free shuttle which takes you to Kata beach doesn’t have much to offer so we had to spend money on travel which is not ideal. The buffet breakfast in disappointing. Same food not much variety which is different to what I expected after reading the initial reviews. The fruit they offer in the morning is basic only two variety very disappointing. The staff are overall ok but the language barrier makes it difficult. Had it not been for a particular staff member Ann Prvn the hotel would have had a lower rating. Ann was helpful friendly and made every effort to assist us when required. I felt more comfortable approaching her than the reception. She went out of her way to do the little things which the other staff didn’t bother. Also the maid that made our room was a delight. She made every effort to make the room special for the kids making elephants and amazing creations with the towels.

The shuttle service they provide to pick up guests from the Superior rooms to their lobby is pathetic. Even the manager is rude and will not entertain any complaints. We complained about torn bed-sheet in the room, and they replaced it with a bed-sheet which was torn more than the previous one (photo attached).

379,"Having travelled a lot to Asian countries, I experienced a lot of times with Accor group, which also include Novotel, so I can say that this hotel is not deriving the value of Novotel. Eventually, this hotel is not delivering the way a hotel resort shall do. Here's why:- The amenities in room is not complete, I didn't see room slippers, and neither the bottled water- The bottled water only came after I requested later on, although earlier the reception said that they will give me the water right away- Some mosquitos presented in the room, though that I didn't open-wide the balcony door, if I did open, it would be very minimum, so it will not do the equation of much mosquitos in the roomLuckily most of the staffs are very polite, otherwise I would rate this hotel as terrible. All-in-all, for me this hotel is not worthed to spend a night into, especially considering that we need to pay extra due to their resort title.","June 21, 2019","6    Novotel Phuket Resort

410,"Overall good resort with nice breakfast place, especially the eggs chef(very enthusiastic and best cheesy omelette) with friendly housekeeping staff. Great view of the patong beach from the lobby. 2 stars reviews for the very poor service from front desk from check in and check out, and stay experience.第二次入住这家酒店，因为喜欢这里的设施，风景泳池都很美。可是这次前台服务员整体都服务很差，唯有早餐自助餐里的服务员，尤其是煎蛋的厨师特别开朗与专业。housekeeping 的大姐也很亲切，房间都准备的很好。办入住时，问了前台有帮我们安排了风景好一点的房间吗？。他跟我说了你定的是普通房，而且是在Agoda订的，我帮不到你也安排不到给你。到了房里，用qr code 扫了点餐roomservice. 30分钟过了，打去问他们食物及时会到，他却问我你有点到食物吗？哦，你点了一个意大利面，二十分钟后会跟你送到房间。我就取消了room service。去了餐厅想吃自助餐晚餐，餐厅却又告示牌说，酒店已不再提供自助餐，请到另一家吃单点的泰式和印度餐。隔壁房间吃的room service 退了房，过了一天盘子也没收，每次回到房间都会闻到一股臭味。退房时连一句谢谢也没有。好好一个来度假的地方，都被低质量的服务影响变了 NONOTEL.","May 12, 2019","6    Novotel Phuket Resort

415,"Having spent 6nights in this hotel was extremely relaxing. Great weather, lovely restaurants and extraordinary staff members. Special mention to Jimmy and Khung from the activity department, they made our day every single day. The hotel offers at least 10 types of activities including yoga lessons, water sports, table tennis.. Great features! Only disappointment was the water level which I know the hotel can't control. The water just disappears in every 6-8 hours and comes back after a while. Some people loves walking through the mud but its not something I prefer. Anyway, it's out of the hotel hand, so it does not affect the score I gave.

Room was a large room overlooking the pool very nice but a little tired and dated , only thing annoying was glass panels overlooking pool had large cracks in them !! . Tried evening buffet in restaurant that night thought was ok but a bit pricey for what you got 995 bht pp. the nxt day we went out of room for 6 hrs to come back to find room not cleaned asked at reception to sort and they said it would be done straight away 2 hrs later still not sorted so went to see hotel reception manager moie who was very sorry and moved us to a exceptional room complete with own swimming pool a duplex apartment spread over 2 floors thank you to hotel reception manager . Next day we where greeted by Dennis who is hotel general manager who could not apologise enough but glad we had now been sorted and offered us a complimentary massage as a good will gesture Overall the hotel is excellent but a little tired in places , staff are tremendous and always smiling , they run a shuttle bus into Patong town twice a day the pools and views from the pool and beach are to die for Overall a good hotel which I would visit again due to the care of the general manager Dennis in seeing a slight problem and sorting straight away If you want to visit phi phi vist local tour operator at side of hotel who will do a excellent day trip to there and monkey island with star boats for 2500bht each","February 25, 2019","7    Crowne Plaza Phuket Panwa Beach

420,"HiWe stayed at this hotel in Feb 2019 for almost 2 weeks. It is a lovely hotel with very friendly, polite and helpful staff (special thanks to Aeed and Fern). Breakfast, bar food and the restuarant were of high quality and a good service. Only thing is that the food is a little pricey, and we tried visiting Sam's Kitchen/Restuarant across the road a few times. Visiting Sam's was a mistake for us as it is full of smokers which made an unpleasant meal. Also, our stomachs weren't the most pleasant after the meal in Sam's Kitchen. We recommend best to eat at the hotel as the food is very good...Thats if you don't mind the price or alternatively visit Cape Panwa which has several good restuarants,The hotels private beach is very private, with pleasantly warm sea water. You also have the choice of 2 terrific swimming pools. In all, a very good hotel to choose and we definately recommend a stay at the Crowne Plaza, Panwa Beach.Hope our review helps.

424,"We scheduled a day pass when our Princess ship changed our tender dock from Patong to Dolphin Pier in Ao Makham. We did not feel like taking 45 minute cab ride across the Island to the Patong area and decided to try a beach day closer to the pier. The Grab ride from Dolphin pier was about 8 minutes and cost 400 baht. The staff was very friendly and responded quickly to our last minute inquiry. A pool pass costs 400 baht ($12 USD). per person. The infinity pool and grounds are lovely. Drinks and foods run about 200 to 350 baht. The hotel was tranquil and relaxing, It had just the laidback atmosphere we were looking for. The bathrooms are clean with a shower and lockers. Towels are provided along with up to date loungers. There are two pools to choose from. The beach, however, was interesting and the main reason for 4 stars. It looks best before noon and after 5:00 pm. The water is too shallow to swim in. At its highest tide, maybe reaches the knees. Over the afternoon the water recedes as the tide leaving wet sand and puddles. Around 4 pm the tide starts to come in. I gather the condition of the beach ties into the price. Overall for the price and facilities we had a good time and lovely views for a couple of hours. ","February 6, 2019","7    Crowne Plaza Phuket Panwa Beach

425,"After coming back to the Crowne Plaza following a fabulous break last year, we were slightly disappointed to see the Sunday Brunch had changed somewhat. Last year we paid considerably more, but found an abundance of fresh seafood and a drinks package that included unlimited sparkling wine. The band and DJ also contributed significantly to the atmosphere, making it more for an occasion than just a regular buffet meal.This year, even though less than half the price, there was no band/DJ. The food choice was a little more limited with hardly any fresh seafood and no drinks packages.I appreciate this now caters more to the masses and budget travelers but feels like it cheapens the brand.*service however was up to the usual standard and couldn’t be faulted.","February 3, 2019","7    Crowne Plaza Phuket Panwa Beach

427,"High standard resort... you are breath-taken first time you walk into the reception area and has the view to the sea... good rooms, great service and good food. Make sure to get room with semi-private pool... fantastic view and facilities... Why only 4 and not 5 stars?: The beach is not to good... the tide is impacting the beach quite much due to low waters... we didnt use the beach but only the pool... so if you expect the ""beach experience"" as on the west coast of Phuket ... dont go to Crowne Plaza... but: you get a much more quiet and relaxing atmosphere than on the west coast... and it is fair close to Phuket town... a good hint: use the neighbour restaurant (Best restaurant is the name)... amazing food for pennies.... Sadly the price level in the bar and restaurant is a bit higher than other 5 star hotels... e.g. massage for 2.500 bath/hour... right next to the hotel you find it for 600 baht/hour... and get view to the sea in that price as well.","February 1, 2019","7    Crowne Plaza Phuket Panwa Beach

428,"My husband and I are IHG members, and most of the time, we stay in Intercontinental hotel. However, the Intercontinental in Phuket won’t be open until this October, we decided to stay in Crowne Plaza for 3 nights.Here are the pros and cons about this beach resort.Pros:1. The staff we encountered was all super friendly and helpful, such as Sao, Kwang, Ying, and all the front desk staff. They made our stay more pleasant. It’s because of Kwang, we could get our food right. And she also provided us a lot of useful information.2. We were upgraded to the pool suite. It’s very spacious and comfortable.3. The breakfast buffet was pretty nice, with a lot of selections. And the setup of the restaurant was nice as well. I personally prefer big tables.Cons:1. The pool suites are located on the first floor. Usually, there are both curtains and sheers in a hotel room. However, there are only curtains but no sheers in our suite. Actually, all the pool suites in this resort have curtains only, which means if you want to have your privacy when you stay in your room, you need to sacrifice the sunshine and the view. Otherwise, just get prepared that people who pass your suite might have an eye contact with you!2. The quality of the food was just ok. One night, we ordered room service: pad Thai, seafood pasta, and pizza. Only the pizza somehow reached our expectation. The tomato sauce in the pasta still tasted like it was just got out of the can. Surprisingly, a big hotel like this, they used canned tomato sauce or paste instead of fresh ones to make the sauce. As for the pad Thai, very very dry, the noodles were hard, and the peanuts were not freshly ground; they became sticky because of the moisture. That’s how I could tell they’ve been there for a while. For a very common and simple dish as pad Thai, the quality they delivered was very disappointing!3. Even though the staff was super sweet, some of them was not informative enough. We asked for information regarding the shopping malls. Instead of sending us to the fancy and big one, Central Festival, we were told to go to the one named Robinson, which is very outdated and small. The name of the fancy one was not even mentioned. We would appreciate it if the information was provided, and then it’s up to us to make a decision. Overall, the staff is super sweet and friendly, which definitely makes guests feel warm and welcome. However, the professionalism should be improved.","January 28, 2019","7    Crowne Plaza Phuket Panwa Beach

430,For $300 a night we expected more. The room was not big at all. The view was the pool and breakfast area plus the beach if you could call it a beach - I will get onto that later. Bed was comfortable. Breakfast had a great amount of choices and the pool area was very nice due to not having to fight for a sunbed due to two pools and the pool attendents being mindful of people reserving sunbeds. Great hotel for children with activities going on all day long. If you swam in the pool there was a layer of oil from sunscreen which is probably unavoidable. Staff were accommodating and the spa wonderful.We are beach people and were very disappointed with the beach only having a couple of metres of sand then went into mudflats/black sand. The tide comes in only for a few hours and you have to walk a long way out to get any depth. What really worried us was alongside the hotel 5 minute walk to the left is a huge open drain that smelt so bad that you gagged. This drain must have been sewage and spilt open onto the mudflats. For health and safety we did not swim in the ocean for this reason. There are massage tables near to the drain and for the life of me the smell would not be pleasant if you were trying to have a relaxing massage.You need transport if you are here as you are in the quiet area and there is nothing much around.,"January 21, 2019","7    Crowne Plaza Phuket Panwa Beach

431,"Location - The other end of Phuket. Tucked away from a lot of touristy spots. Upside is it’s very quiet and comes with the joy of private beach and beach facing pools (yes, multiple pools). Downside, quite a drive to many tourist spots, and if you are going to rely on cabs/taxis, it turns out to be very expensive.Rooms - Varied variety of rooms available. Many with great views to the beach. Some duplex rooms with small private mini pools attached to each room. If they don’t like you, they will throw you to one end of the hotel, with its views obstructed by some sort of bushes and spa buildings. Does not matter even if you are an IHG platinum member. Your room could be quite a walking distance away from the entrance/lobby/restaurants, mine was! And it was difficult to get to the room carrying an infant. Wish they were more considerate. In essence great fixed infrastructure, but you have to get lucky to get good rooms.Price - Premium pricing, of course! Value for money? Not at all! Even the restaurants are expensive. You will find many guests dining at restaurants across the street or next to the hotel.Service - Well, every time they see you, the wish you with a namaste. And that’s about it. There is something lacking in service. They do just what needs to be done and noting more. Have experienced much better service levels, which makes service here just, meh! But the front desk helps with good information regarding tourist spots, and also helps in arranging taxis. Also, I wish they were more accommodating towards families with infants. Restaurant - Italian restaurant by the beach serves good Italian. And being a vegetarian, pizzas were a saviour! The Thai restaurant was grossly overpriced with minuscule portion sizes. Lobby has a restaurant that serves cocktails. A nice cafe, with good coffee. And ridiculous pastries. No wonder they try to sell them away from 6-7PM with a 50% off. And we loved the bagel on the first day. We ordered it again on the second day, two of them this time, and the chef forgot the cream cheese, and then we forgot the cafe existed!Breakfast - Complimentary. Except if you are a platinum IHG and have booked on points, you pay for breakfast. The spread itself is good, but I have seen better. The pastries however felt soggy and not fresh. Peanut butter and Nutella is tastefully served in small cups in the tiniest amounts possible (pun intended!). Overall, a letdown!Parking - Available. Not sure if valet available. Tip - Choose this resort if you are going to spend a lot of time at the private beach and the beach facing pool. Also, duplex rooms are the way to go!

434,"Well, the bad experience started with the reception itself where an irritated front office executive who had language problems attended us. We wanted a paid upgrade for our room as our room was facing a wall (It’s not a garden view but a wall view). But we were told all rooms are booked. When we checked, on most travel portals higher category rooms were available. So first warning, never book a classic room (my room number was 2316) as it a very basic room with a wall view! Next very very few staff specially for the peak Year End season. The restaurants were empty but the food would take atleast 45 mins to be served. Then at night we went to their beachside restaurant Patio for dinner. We were told they only serve Italian. We wanted to eat Thai. So we went to the Thai restaurant. We placed the order and we saw Food from the Thai restaurant being served at Patio. On enquiring their staff informed that at Patio Thai food can get served too. The food took more than 45 mins to come again. The other problem with the classic rooms are the mosquitoes. As behind the wall there is a jungle and if you open the doors mosquitoes will not let you sleep the entire night. Overall first night have been pathetic here. Hope tomorrow turns out to be better.

We had forgot our iPhone charger and an adorable staff member from concierge went to buy it for us to the closest seven eleven.The atmosphere is great at the hotel and the view from the rooms is on the sea.Highly recommend the restaurant across the street for great fish and lovely Thai family running it super cheap and delicious.Would work more on breakfast which offers only 3 varieties of fruit banana, watermelon and pineapple and juices are extra so being on an island I would expect a better variety of fresh fruits and juices.Over all we had a great stay and highly recommend the resort.","December 29, 2018","7    Crowne Plaza Phuket Panwa Beach

436,"Panwa is located about 45mins AWAY from the touristy destination Patong...quiet, peaceful & clean. The Crowne plaza has its own private beach that was very clean & well maintained. Hotel rooms were clean & spacious with their own Pte balcony. Ours had a sea view balcony. Unfortunately, no free breakfast was included in our purchase and it was expensive (per pax daily rate) if we wanted to have the buffet breakfast in the hotel. Luckily for us, just opposite the hotel is a roadside diner with reasonable prices and even better, just a 5-10mins Walk from the hotel (exit hotel’s main entrance & turn left) is another eatery, literally By the side of the road serving amazing authentic (spicy) Thai food at an even more affordable price!

437,"We got upgraded on arrival which was great although it took them ages to check us in. Our room was amazing as suites go. We ordered room service one evening from their Italian choice, however it was very disappointing. We actually went to the restaurant another evening to have a glass of wine and a nibble, assuming the poor food was down to the room service, but it was probably worse. As we spent quite a bit, the GM apologized and gave us a 50% discount on our entire food and drink bill during our stay, which was a very responsive and classy approach. However, on hearing the feedback on our final morning the food and beverage manager was a little intense, hanging around our table, clearing our plates, telling us she hoped we enjoyed the breakfast on numerous occasions. The beach was beautiful to look at but would not swim in as it was jelly fish season and too murky to see if there were any or not. The view was amazing. So beautiful. The pools were great to hang out in and the staff friendly and helpful. If you get a good deal then it's a relaxing value for money retreat, but if you pay top dollar your expectations will not be met. ","November 27, 2018","7    Crowne Plaza Phuket Panwa Beach

439,"This hotel doesn’t do enough to offset it’s bad location.It needs more features, events, amenities, Here are a few ideas: free water sports equipment, free snacks in the room, kids movie night, a happy hour with a real discount, cheap/easy transportation, a moderately priced restaurant option, arts/crafts lessons, bluetooth speakers.We liked the room. We didn’t like the awkward upgrade process by which we were basically trapped and tricked into getting it. The kid zone was pretty depressing. I don't think it's a great option for families. Two swimming pools, one nice view--and that's it. Fortunately, there is a scooter rental place across the street; otherwise, you're trapped.","October 28, 2018","7    Crowne Plaza Phuket Panwa Beach

440,"Visited still during low season, beginning of October. The Hotel was very quiet and we really got to enjoy all the amenities. The bar was amazing, the Mosaic restaurant amazing, the views amazing. This hotel has it all. Do not look any further when thinking of a place in Phuket. If you want to splurge a little, get the Panwa lagoon duplex suite, you get your own semi-private pool, totally worth it! They knew it was our anniversary, and we arrived to the room to find a lovely romantic turndown and a delicious cake amenity for us! Really nice touch! The best thing about this Hotel though is the staff. Ma in Reception gave us the warmest of welcomes, explained everything we needed to know and then was there throughout our stay to help us with anything we needed. Fern in Concierge was the best. Gave us great ideas of where to go and what to do, and also helped us rent a scooter bike from the Hotel to go explore. Definitely worth trying out if you can! (A bit scary but very nice to go places at your own pace). Fern was absolutely amazing. Khanittha S (Ying) at Concierge helped us organise some activities before our arrival and she was very thorough explaining everything and booking everything for us. We went to Elephant Jungle Sanctuary one day, and had the Early bird Phi Phi islands tour another day. These two were just amazing. Both in small groups (the speedboats beware of the companies that pack like 45 people on a boat!). The one they recommended from the Hotel was great. You also MUST try a Thai Massage at the SPA. Ja at Spa Reception is so sweet and helped us with booking our treatments. She even recommended some local restaurants for us to go to in Phuket Town. Our stars really were Tik and Muay, our Spa therapists. Absolutely amazing ladies, the best massages we have ever had. They were always attentive and the treatments were just fabulous. Tum at Mosaic restaurant was very patient with us being indecisive about our food and he was very kind to remember my drink order! He also was very sweet teaching us how to pronounce the food items that we were ordering!Last but not least, we were met by three Managers on Duty while we were there, Ms Kwang that gave us a great Thai language lesson, the security manager (not remember his name, sorry!) and the Chef. They were so attentive and delightful. We felt so cared for and recognised throughout the hotel. The General Manager Mr Denis Martin runs this hotel beautifully. Cannot recommend enough. (Also, it’s an IHG property and as an IHG member, on top of everything else, you get points and all your benefits! What else would you want :) )Thank you Crowne Plaza!

449,"I am IHG Spire Elite member , which means that I spend more than 100+ days in a year at IHG Hotels which include Intercontinental / Crowne Plaza / Holiday Inn etc . This time for a family vacation we decided to book Crowne Plaza , Panwa Beach Phuket . The location is a little far from the airport and other standard places and sites of Phuket . However the location is good . We stayed in the Suite room with a private lap pool . The rooms had good view of the sea but had a private lap pool which is good . The restaurants and the pool bar staff was very helpful and good . However the House Keeping was a nightmare . Two days during our 5 day stay they forgot to service our rooms . One of the days we had the Service Tag outside which they saw it as turned around to say Do not Disturb . The other day they said that they only service the room when the service my room tag is displayed . That means if you do not put the tag on the door , then dont expect to get your room cleaned up even once a day . The house keeping staff who came to service our room was pretty polite but the front office kept on defending their staff .Secondly,the rooms have sparse storage space. For us who was travelling with a kid , it was pretty difficult to operate out of suitcases . That being said that we stayed in a suite room . Thirdly , be prepared to shell out a lot of money on Taxi fares as getting any where from the hotel is a minimum 500 - 600 B. They have a shuttle which runs to a nearby mall which is a free service but the timings are at 10 AM and 4 PM which we felt to be pretty odd . Overall , the rooms and restaurants are good . The location / House Keeping and front office service has lots of improve .","July 21, 2018","7    Crowne Plaza Phuket Panwa Beach

All the staffs are very qute and gentle, kind and helpful in their approaches. I cannot make any complaint of the property and their employees.

We were over the moon when we found crown plaza and its own cafe standing off the road leading to Panwa Beach! It was a life-saver when you have walked for 25 minutes out of nowhere with nothing around under cooking sun! The hotel stuff were very welcoming and they served us in the cafe and the hotel bar with great help even though we were not in-house guests(they did not ask any questions and were just happy to serve you). After couple cups of coffee and mocktail, we headed to the private beach owned by the hotel (Panwa Beach). It was a fairly small beach facing to a beautiful bay surrounded by some lovely mountains. There is a place you can rent equipment for canoeing and we paid USD14(we paid in THB) for one hour for both of us and we had the whole bay to ourselves! The water is crystal clear and view was spectacular since the bay is facing to the open ocean where we could see our Royal Caribbean ship!On the way back to our ship, we booked the hotel van for transport. it was quite expensive(roughly USD13) for the short distance but it was worthy of the money for the convenience,comfort and safety.","June 4, 2018","7    Crowne Plaza Phuket Panwa Beach

But since we wanted a peaceful time we still decided to go with this decision. And boy did we love it!!! It was the best decision ever!! The resort was exactly what we wanted. It was beautiful, comfortable, picturesque with a lovely private beach surrounded by tall, majestic palms with an infinity pool. It akso had a number of other pools, from children's to one with waves and a jacuzzi. Then there were the rooms which were absolutely stunning. And the bathrooms had a tub as well as a stall. The best thing was a muslim shower. Being a muslim it was indeed a treat for us!!And oh the breakfast was a real spread!! Each item par excellence. And last but not the least i would like ro say a few words abput the staff. I have traveled to thailand a number of times, to be precise, this was my 7th visit. But the kind of hospitality and service i received here, at the Crowne Plaza, was unmatchable. The whole staff went out of the way to make this stay a perfect one for us. Every need was not only met, but met with prompt and with the best smiles. Even when i booked a tour and had an early morning pick up, the hotel staff prepared a box of fresh breakfast for me to take with me. They arranged for a towel, water and the breakfast.

466,"Staying for 4 nights for a vacation and this property is not recommended at all:1- cleanliness;: go a lizard at the room with service coming after about 30 minutes, to step on my bed with the socks and taking it with the hand. The rooms are very dirty and have not been cleaned properly.2- service: any room service of a blanket, getting someone to get away lizards or anything take 30-60 mins minimum3- location is far and isolated from the real Thailand, you'd spend much on taxis or miss the life in Thailand.

This was great sitting outside enjoying the view. The spa is very nice to go to. Breakfast in the mornings is incredible with such a variety you do not know where to start. The concierge ""Wut"" was the best. He is so friendly and will help you with anything and he personally sees to your needs. This gentleman needs to be the PR director for crowne plaza.

You do need to scooter or at least a bike tho to get around.Room: Clean and spacious and the most comfy bed in the world!The restaurant doesn't really have any healthy choices but the food was excellent.The hotel rents scooters and bikes for a great price and without deposit for hotel guests- This would be one of the reasons I would book this place again other than the nice staff and rooms.

Comfortable bed and well-equipped amenities in the room. And though it’s located besides the road, noise isn’t an issue at all in the day or at night. And the staff was always friendly and smiling, which brightens up our day! And a special shout out to Aew, who took the time to prepare a special request intended for my wife.

475,"The hotel was lovely and the staff was helpful and friendly. They helped me make excursion and taxi reservations and made my stay very nice. This was my 1st trip to Phuket and I chose Nairharn Beach area because I thought it would be peaceful. However, this area of Phuket is not pedestrian friendly, full of Russian tourists, and rather expensive for Thailand. Maybe that's how all of Phuket is, I don't know, But having traveled around the world, there are better beach destinations in other countries (Bali is much better in my opinion). However, if you are coming to Nairharn Beach anyway, I highly recommend this hotel. ","February 22, 2019","8    Naiharn Beach Resort

478,"I really loved my time at Naiharn Beach Resort. Naiharn is right at the bottom end of Phuket. Its pretty far from the airport but that means you'll be in a relatively quieter and much cleaner part of the island.The resort itself is close to some good bars and restaurants and the beach is a 5 min walk or 1 min scooter ride.The rooms were great with everything I needed - Great big beds, tv, wifi and aircon.The staff were really exceptional. They helped me plan the rest of my trip once I got there. I also ran into some complications while I was there and they went above and beyond to help me in every way they could.The restaurant was great - you have a good selection of European and Thai food and the bar was even better. The owner is an Aussie expat. A great guy, very helpful. Have a beer with him and you'll get some much needed local insight about what to do and where to go.I'll definitely be back here on my next trip.","January 31, 2019","8    Naiharn Beach Resort

482,"A small resort with about 20 rooms and a salt water pool and some snack restaurant/bar facilities on-site. Friendly and caring staff, especially the on-site manager Joliza that's a true star.The rooms are quite nice, though not top notch in standard, and also kept quite clean. Sleeping quality is generally good, but there's regretfully a major ongoing construction across the road which causes noise and heavy traffic. It should be better in a year or so when that construction work should be over.The Nai Harn Beach is very nice and on a ten minute easy walk from the resort. Add another 10 minutes walk (and a bit of height) and you'll get to the yet-nice Ao Sane Beach which also features nice snorkeling. Other beaches can be reached with a 10-15 minutes taxi ride.The on-site pool is nice and offers a morning or afternoon alternative to the beach.The breakfast (if you included it in your reservation) is served at the on-site Lucky 13 Sandwich snack restaurant. We'd recommend you to eat your breakfast elsewhere, e.g. at the Bolangerie around the corner. The service as Lucky 13 is slow and very varying and the choices are not what we expected, e.g. missing the opportunity to have a fruit platter to breakfast. It's instead hamburgers, bacon and BLT sandwiches etc that are on the breakfast menu - not really what we'd pick if we had another choice. The staff often served us something else that what we ordered or didn't follow what was stated on the menu.All in all a good, friendly, stay, but next time we'll skip the breakfast.","December 31, 2018","8    Naiharn Beach Resort

483,"My first visit to naiharn beach, I found this resort via Google and booked on agoda after reading reviews on several places in my budget. Naiharn beach resort has good reviews and I agree also.The chalets are large and new with modern shower, aircon, TV, fridge, drinking water replaced daily and a comfy king-size bed. I slept well there. There is a pool and restaurant at the resort and a bar near the lake. The food here is good, the staff are great fun too. Naiharn is a small beach place, but there are many restaurants and 7/11 a short walk away. For more nightlife there is diligaf bar and stumble inn about 10 mins walk away. Rawai is just down the hill from there, also banana bar complex is the other way, but it's a long walk (20mins). I hired a bicycle (bring your own bike lights) to get around on as taxis on phuket are overpriced.I really enjoyed my stay here, it was end of October and the weather was perfect. I recommend this resort to every kind of traveller and I am going back early in the new year to see all my new friends. I give it 10/10, really good place.

484,"My friend and I had a wonderful time at Naiharn Beach Resort, everyone was so friendly and welcoming, it was hard to leave! I had a bit of shaky start when I fell and sprained my ankle on the first day, but the staff coyld not have been more helpful, advising on pharmacies, a good English speaking doctor, and notably not just recommending an excellent place for a massage but actually telling the masseuse about the accident so she could specifically work on that, which has gone a long way to speeding recovery! My friend hired a motorbike from the resort and she was fully guided on riding it, and thereafter had an amazing time exploring the area while I recuperated in the lovely salt water pool. The bar is the beating heart of the resort, and very much the local watering hole, where we could order anything from cocktails, to coconuts, to thai food which could be ordered in on request, perfect when after a day of island hopping I fancied tom yum soup and my friend wanted a sandwich from the resort restaurant. We had some great nights there talking with Chris, the owner, and his friends, who generously offered insights on getting the best from our stay. This isn’t an insanely touristy area, as compared to Patong or even Kata Beach, so the beach wasn’t crowded, and there are shops and restaurants close by. We felt so relaxed, safe and at home, we actually extended our stay an extra night, and we left feeling like we had family here.We’re already talking about our return trip!","October 5, 2018","8    Naiharn Beach Resort

485,"I've been travelling to Phuket now for several years and I have stayed in lots of different places from exclusive 5-6 Star resorts, beautiful AirBnB villas and also some cheaper let's say less exclusive places. I have to say the number 1 so far for both comfort, value and location has to be Naiharn Beach resort. It is located right on the corner of beautiful lake next to Nai Harn beach and within a short walk of the local shops restaurants and bars. The area is incredibly beautiful and very big on fitness and fun. If you are visiting for fitness you will see lots of joggers every morning running around the lake and the good thing about Naiharn Beach resort is that if you fancy a walk on the beach early in the morning before its gets too busy and too hot the restaurant at the resort opens from 6am which you will find it very difficult to find anywhere nearby open until 9 or even 10am. The hotel bungalow rooms are smart and modern only a year or so since opening and perfect for a couple in fact some of our friends who were renting a big villa nearby actually spent more time at the resort with us by the pool than they did at their own villa! Their kids loved it. I don't know why but the place is really cool and has everything you need whether you are a solo traveller a couple or a family. The team there are like one big family JoJo who runs the reception speaks perfect English and is incredibly helpful, She can organise anything you wish from a Taxi a hire car or a Scooter, she even organised a day trip for us riding quad bikes in the jungle which was amazing! The owner is a guy called Chris and he was incredibly welcoming and there was nothing he couldn't do for us, everything was in his words ""a pleasure"".In short i couldn't recommend Naiharn Beach resort highly enough.Best value, food, location so far in many years.Thanks again to all the team at Naiharn Beach resort!

The hotel feels very homely with having a handful of pet dogs and cats greeting you at your door, restaurant, pool, bar! It was very clean, stylish and comfy bed! Loved the bathroom - rainfall shower head. The room was spacious and almost felt like a hotel you'd find in the UK! The poolside was really chilled and you could order food/drinks to eat as you sat there - we also could order food to our room as no extra charge 24 hours a day! Wifi was good and accessible everywhere - room, pool, bar, restaurant! The only thing I can critique is the food in the restaurant isn't cheap, compared to cheaper restaurants we found in the area, but not more than a handful of others in the area.

We wanted to pay by card (which we've been using with no problems on other places). The terminal machine wasn't working and the receptionist called the owner. When he came he treated us very impolitely and rude for NO reason, since the only thing we wanted is to pay HIS business. We tried a different card and It didn't work either. We had to go to the cash machine and pay by cash. We requested an invoice and all we got is a receipt. We asked again for a proper invoice and finally it got sorted. The owner didn't apologised or changed his attitude toward us. We felt extremely unpleasant and unwelcome. It was a real pity that we had to leave this place on that note.

Breakfast that was included was a choice between Thai or Western food not a massive selection. Staff were very helpful in organizing the taxi from Phuket airport.The Toilet and Shower setup was a bit funny.

We were met with the warm Aussie charm of the owner Chris and instantly made to feel at home. Jo was an amazing host. Friendly and hospitable. Our room in the resort was comfortable and modern, with the best bed I'd slept on in Thailand! The air con was bliss!The resort has a great central pool and restaurant. And a fantastic bar with a pool table and the longest running happy hour ever! There's a fun, laid back feeling to this place that makes relaxing easy. We had easy access to motorbikes and only a short stroll to the beach or motorbike to surrounding restaurants. We made great friends with the other guests during our stay and truely felt like it was our second home, even though we were there for 2 days! I highly recommended Naiharn Beach Resort to travellers looking for a relaxing holiday in an all inclusive location, where the only thing you need to worry about is Where's the piña colada!!Thanks Chris!

The owner (an Aussie fellow by the name of Chris) took over an hour of his time - along with his staff - to help me find my way. One thing led to another after that... and I ended up having a beer and swimming in their pool.I ended up coming back with my girlfriend a couple of days later and stayed a few nights. The location is clean and well kept. The rooms are top rate, with safe box, air conditioning and clean, comfortable bedding. The pool is outstanding and the food is good & at a reasonable price. The location is less than 10 minutes walk from Nai Harn beach - and the resort itself is quiet and nicely tucked away from the busy beach traffic.As I said, I stumbled across the place by accident - and it turned out to be the cornerstone of an outstanding trip to Phuket.Would recommend to anyone without hesitation.

523,"Having spent the majority of our holiday wedding planning for our up and coming Wedding in Phuket next year - we decided to spend our last four nights relaxing and we were very excited to have found The Village Coconut Island resort.We initially booked a Seaview Pool Villa, but we were delighted to have been upgraded to a grand two bedroom pool villa, we also decided to upgrade to all inclusive once we were there which we can’t recommend enough! On arrival, the staff meet you on the pontoon and take care of your luggage, we were offered a welcome drink at reception and encouraged to relax whilst we were checked in, then shortly afterwards we were taken on a golf cart to our stunning villa. The villa itself was incredible - our own dream home in paradise, with gorgeous views and a secluded pool. Having upgraded to all inclusive, the mini bar and snacks were refilled daily.The food was incredible! I am a vegetarian, but also dairy intolerant, therefore it is often a challenge to find a substantial meal, however there are so many vegetarian/ vegan options on the menu, and they will happily adapt meals - my favourite restaurant was the Kabang Restaurant and bar, both for the food and incredible setting - right on the beach, overlooking the idyllic, picture perfect ocean views. My fiancé highly recommended the Rock Lobster red curry off the menu! All restaurant staff were so friendly and attentive, taking time to engage with you, remember your name and ensure your glass was never empty!We had a slight issue with the air con in our villa, which they attempted to fix a couple of times, unfortunately it still didn’t function fully, making it rather warm, however we were grateful that the director of operations followed up on this in receipt of our feedback.The resort pools are large and clean, there were numerous sun loungers, but they seemed to get reserved quite early, but during our stay we mainly used our villa pool. We booked the boat to Rang Yai Island during our stay, which we have visited before, it is beautiful and we recommend spending an afternoon there during your stay.We loved our stay on Coconut Island so much, we plan to return next year for our Honeymoon.

There is a small supermarket and day spa on the island and plenty of planned daily activities you can do if you want too. Canoes, paddle boards and a catamaran are also available for guests to use.

527,"My family and I, 2 adults and 2 teens, went to this resort on the 27th June 2019 for 4 days. The villa was perfect. We really loved the view and the private pool in the villa was a nice indulgence. Apart from the fact that there was no hand soap and the air conditioning in the master bedroom leaked on the day we were leaving (lucky!) we were happy with the accommodations. The food however was not so great. I say this because I am Muslim and although the hotel said the meat is halal it was hard because there were not many choices available. For example, the egg station for breakfast uses the same pan used for omelettes made using ham. I had to request a new pan to be used for me. The swimming is wonderful because they have a fantastic slide. Unfortunately the slide closes at 6pm. And towels by the pool runs out so bring the pool towels provided in your rooms. The service staff were wonderful and friendly. I liked that all activities are provided free for the first hour. If you want to relax it's a nice hotel with a quaint village. Boat services to the mainland is free and 24 hours. You can order Grab at the mainland jetty. We did that and ended up using her for the whole trip.

529,"The Village Coconut Island Resort is 40 minutes by road and 15 minutes by boat from the Phuket airport. Far yet not not too far if ypu want to break into city life now and then. One gets dropped at a private hotel pier with a bar, curteous staff and outdoor waiting area by the water for the boat to come and get you, which comes every half hour. As one approaches the hotel by boat one is greeted by a long pier with rustic wooden arches which light up beautifully at night.The arch of the island with lush green coconut trees and gently sloping hill is a beautiful sight. The resort sits at this Phang Nga Bay so the sea is calm and gentle ideal for Kayaking, yatching and bathing. There is a bar and deck area with late night restaurant where food is served breakfast till 1:30am right on the beach which is the buzz and heart of the hotel sided by a well sized pool. There is one more pool higher up the slope and a third water slide pool, a favourite with the young and old alike.We stayed at the beachfront villa with a very good sized pool and a two bedroom, two storied villa with a well equipped kitchen. The beach is barely 6 to 7 steps away from the pool here and is a fantastic spot with the best of all worlds. The resort mostly has family villas and suites and is perfect for family getaways with plenty of entertainment and activities to keep one busy at the resort. Their fire show is one of the best in Phuket.Food is fesh, well made with sufficient variety is available for all. It is a vast resort of 200 villas, suites n rooms so service is a bit slow and can be improved. Also maintainence in some areas can also be pulled up but will not prevent you from enjoying the resort.We thoroughly enjoyed the stay here and their warm thai hospitality.","July 3, 2019","9    The Village Coconut Island Beach Resort

534,"The best thing about this resort is the hospitality staff, who were completely lovely in every way. I'm a single mother and I was travelling in with my elderly parents and the staff at the restaurant did everything possible to make our stay enjoyable - including distracting my twin toddlers during meals. The rest of the resort however was average. The beach is a little gross, the water opaque and full of jellyfish. The slide - supposedly good for children is ridiculously strong and fast and it propelled myself and my 2 year old under water at the end. The other slide has a pool at the end of each 5m stretch which involves me dragging the kid from section to section. The food is average and the drinks are awful. I had to upgrade cocktail spirits to bottom shelf from a shelf I didn't know existed. The room was nice although if you look close electrical outlets are exposed behind flimsy covering and the door to the private pool didn't lock which means toddlers could drown at any time - mine included, which caused a high level of stress for the entire stay. Raised these issues with management, who slipped a note under my door and was then unavailable when I wanted to speak. Bed/bedding average to subpar. Front office is disorganised, ferry left us stranded in the 31 degree heat for almost two hours. Travelled on an all-inclusive Luxury Escapes package only to discover I could have booked the resort for half the cost. Super disappointing experience.","June 23, 2019","9    The Village Coconut Island Beach Resort

535,We chose the All Inclusive Package which we feel was very good value. Food was excellent with plenty of choice and the drinks just kept flowing!We had a jacuzzi room which was spacious and the bed and pillows very comfortable. The jacuzzi was very private and great to cool off in.All the staff were very friendly and helpful.We especially enjoyed the musical evening entertainment. ,"June 20, 2019","9    The Village Coconut Island Beach Resort

536,"We stayed here for 4 nights on an all-inclusive board.The positives:- location is stunning, island is beautiful and the boat connection to the mainland is regular and quick.- Bar staff and hotel staff are great - friendly and attentive.- Spa is excellent and good value.- Food and drinks in the Thai restaurant (Kabang) are good.- Room was clean and Jacuzzi was good.- Price was *ok* - Kayaks available for guest use were great funHowever, despite these there some significant issues:Firstly with the room:- Air conditioning was not adequate - it struggled to make the room liveable meaning the heat really impacted our sleep. The only area it effectively cooled was directly underneath...- 1 tiny bin - this was bizarre, there's a hob, plates, cutlery but only a single tiny bin in the bathroom/- no soap - again bizarre, there was an abundance of other bathroom products but no soap - we ended up having to wash our hands with shower gel...- drain in bathroom/wet room not adequate - following showers the room would be wet for hours - either the tiling wasn't angled properly or the drain was insufficient - either way, the room was damp for most of the day.The resort itself had issues too:- Stray(?) dogs - there were many presumably stray dogs roaming the grounds. To the extent we had a pair mating 3ft from where we were eating.... Staff reaction was mixed, some were quick to chase, others didn't care.- Loud music all-day at the beachfront - this one is personal taste, but the music was too loud for normal conversation and was constant every day.- Maintenance/worn decoration - the resort is looking a little worn and is in need of refresh/maintenance - the wooden slats leading to reception are somewhat hazardous as several are loose.- Traffic, staff travel quite quickly around the grounds on scooters/motor bikes, quite hazardous at times.- No designated smoking areas in Kabang restaurant/bar, smoking was allowed everywhere, very unpleasant for a non-smoker.In general the resort appeared to be trying to be all things to all people, and didn't really succeed in any one area - specialising as a family resort or an adults luxury resort might resolve this. It certainly wasn't the 5* experience we were led to expect.","June 17, 2019","9    The Village Coconut Island Beach Resort

539,"Although this resort is extremely pretty to visit, it is not worth staying at when visiting phuket unless you want some peace and quiet.Good things were villas with mini swimming pools, comfortable beds, friendly British GM, attractive swimming pool and spectacular sunsets.Bad things are level of customer service, problems with piers at low tide where they forget you at either side with no transport, simple breakfast, no night life and planning your day around water taxis which are 100tb before 12am and 300tb after.A particular unhelpful staff member named ART at pier reception was a waste of a job. He doesnt seem keen to assistant and had no idea how to priotise customers needs and really didn't care about communicating with me about my issue.It's better to stay on phuket mainland and visit little islands for a day trip.

The pools and slides were ageing and very grubby, it didn’t help that so much sand would get dragged into the pool. If you are after gorgeous white sands and blue sea, this resort is far from it! Even on the sister island this is ruined by litter every where. One of the biggest turn offs for this resort was the amount of people smoking. People were smoking in the restaurants and then you could be laid there on a sun bed and the people next to you were smoking. Massive put off!

Every staff member is so kind, making sure every detail is taken care of, they brought my mom a cake for her birthday, even nobody told them (they make a copy of passport when you check-in, and therefore knew). I asked a banana for my 1 yr old, and got bananas every morning from that day on. Breakfast was excellent too! Great choice of different cuisine dishes, delicious coffee latte`s from Jura machines. This resort is great for kids too, there are two slides which is super fun for kids +4 yr. A little bit difficult to go around, if you are interested in exploring Phuket. We mostly stayed at the resort because of small kids. The sea is not super crystal clear like Koh Phi Phi, but take a day trip to one of the neighbouring islands and go snorkeling there. Then again, no tourists like other parts of Phuket except the resort guests, which is worth a lot. Would definitely recommend the resort, and would love to go back one day!","May 12, 2019","9    The Village Coconut Island Beach Resort

552,"When we arrived in Thailand we were greeted by the amazing Terry Changlek (+6681 5979079) who was sent by our The Village Coconut Island staff to collect us and take us to the resort. Then followed a 45 min drive to the resort pier where he told us about Thai culture and all the cool things we can do while here. Eventually we arrived at the pier where a boat was waiting to ferry us to the island. The pier staff were amazing as well and as we spoke very little of the native language having English speaking staff made the whole process that much better. After a short 5 min boat ride we arrived at our resort. The walk off the boat to the lobby check in you should have seen our faces. This place was amazingly beautiful. As we were early and our room not quite ready we checked in our gear and got our passes (luxury escapes all inclusive) we headed for the bar for some drinks and snacks. Almost 2 full hours before we were due to check into our room a member of the front desk staff came to tell us our room was ready early. They came and picked us up from the lobby and drove us the 30 seconds to our suite. The room was so darn amazing. Fresh flowers, large king bed, seperate shower and claw foot bath tub in a big open plan bathroom, our own private deck with spar bath and air conditioning already on which was much needed as we weren’t used to the heat and humidity yet.Every breakfast, lunch and dinner we were met by smiling faces and a friendly greeting. We got to know them all very well and they us. Especially Joy and Alan who were an absolute delight. The tours on offer at the resort are a must. Having a great guide who knows the area definitely helps too as they will tailor the tour to you and if time permits allow you to go off guide to visit somewhere else (like the tiger kingdom). All in all the food and drink was amazing, the staff were nothing short of perfect, and the accomodation and views were to die for.","May 9, 2019","9    The Village Coconut Island Beach Resort

556,"We came here as a surprise for my partner's birthday and what a surprise it was!! I booked through Secret Escapes and the deal was great, including airport transfers, massages, snack credit and a day trip! From the moment we arrived at the jetty (before even getting to the island) it was paradise. The hotel is large but not too big, with all the facilities you could ever need. The spa was fantastic and always had availability, the shop had a good variety of stock and the restaurants were great. İn the evenings there was an amazing menu including some delicious Thai food (special shout out to the crab curry) cocktails were amazing and the breakfast had a huge selection! Service at the restaurants was slow but this is mostly because they are a little understaffed, this didn't really bother us since we felt so damn relaxed all the time! Food and day trips are a lot more expensive than on the mainland, but definitely not expensive by Western standards and if you can afford to stay at the hotel you can certainly afford it's prices. We loved the location of the hotel because we were able to quickly get to the mainland, we enjoyed the water taxi rides and it doesn't take much pre-planning to book ahead for one . We mostly arranged our own tours from Phuket town which was easy and had a fantastic time exploring, but if we wanted to relax in luxury we could think of no where better than the hotel to do this. It's beach was beautiful, the pools were super and it is so much more secluded than other resorts in Phuket. The pools don't have much sunbed space, but we hardly used them so it didn't affect us. The one thing that isn't mentioned much in other reviews is the rooms! We had a jacuzzi suite - the most basic level room- and it was GORGEOUS, one of the most beautiful hotel rooms I have ever stayed in with a wonderful bathroom and secluded garden. Lastly, the staff, nothing was too much for them, they kept smiling despite having to deal with some pretty difficult customers.

559,"We have been to Thailand 7 times & this was our worst experience. We stayed here for 7 nights. This was the 2nd time we’ve stayed on an island in Thailand. Positives-terrific staff-bar staff, Honey, Richelle, Salsa & even the trainees were all attentive & wanted to please. The Asian restaurant was fantastic. Otherwise, we found the food very westernised & not Thai authentic with regard to spice. It was only the day before we left we discovered the benefit of asking for ‘Thai style’. We had to upgrade our room as the garden villa with a pool was unacceptable with wonky lamp shades covered in rusty stains, sinks that didn’t drain, & a pool that didn’t see enough sun. Unfortunately the beach pool view room gave us an upstairs bathroom where the smell of sewerage radiated from the room, the air conditioning was more like a fan, the lounge was sunken in and uncomfortable, but worst of all the pool had floaties of brown bubbly poo on the surface! Not happy. This appeared the day before we were due to leave and by then we were over it. If you like thump thump music while you’re trying to eat by the pool, & you’re there to socialise with other people & not as a romantic couple, then this may be your slice of heaven.If your are in any way impaired physically I would not recommend this venue with the dark pier used for low tide, and the difficulty getting onto the boat without being able to see properly.We do stay in five star accommodation for our work, so we know are spoilt, but we are very practical & this venue is without a doubt 3 star.The luxury escapes deal is only a deal if you feel you get value.

560,"From our first fabulous glimpse of the resort from our short boat transfer to our last moment on the Island we were just blown away by the resort's friendly welcome, sumptuous gardens, delightful restaurants, serene villa and pool, endearing staff and luscious surroundings - We have never felt so relaxed on holiday as we did here - my partner has never seen me smile continuously for a week!! We stayed in a Pool Villa with a sea view which was beautiful; the villa was serviced and drinking water supplied each day, the pool was cleaned regularly, the sheets and towels changed frequently. We had a water leak one evening just before leaving for dinner which was dealt with immediately. We opted not to choose the 'all inclusive' offer as we preferred to take each day as it came - we ate at all 3 restaurants and each one was excellent. We particularly enjoyed eating seated right next to the beach, listening to the relaxing tunes at the bar area and drinking cocktails along with dining in KoKo restaurant which was utterly delicious. Breakfast was included and very good, each day we chose something new. We had been told the hotel was at full capacity, around 750 guests, which we found extremely hard to believe as there was always plenty of room around and in the pool, in the restaurants and bar, gardens and beach. Kahtor Spa was a delightful experience where we both enjoyed three 20 minute treatments with chance to wallow in the huge central Hydrotherapy pool. All of the staff, from the cleaners and gardeners to the reception and management staff, were extremely helpful and polite and nothing was too much trouble, they appeared to be one big happy family! We would rate this resort as 5 stars for the beauty, serenity, seclusion and service and we could not be more delighted that our first experience of such a beautiful country was at The Village and that we will always have the most amazing memories from our time spent here....there are not enough positive words in the English Dictionary to describe our holiday at The Village Coconut Island Resort - UTTERLY FABULOUS!

561,"Visited the resort for 10 days at the end of April. Overall experience was OK. Majority of the staff were very helpful,polite and smiling at all the time with few exceptions ofcourse. Excellent customer care from a gentleman named Richard from the Philippines, who was present from the moment we stepped in the resort. Attentive and proactive. Food was good especially for the fact that it is an island and everything has to be delivered there fresh and it was. On the down side are couple of things: - maintenance of the facilities is very poor.- swimming pools were dirty and tiles not maintain as well the water slides ( all my feet are still with cuts).- The private jacuzzi not clean and parts of it broken. Lizards and snakes going around ( may be its normal for tropical island, however a bit of a shock when a small child shows you a snake before going to the jacuzzi). - “Animal Kingdom” in the rooms. The hotel should provide some devices for the insects in the rooms or at least mosquito nets.  Overall the resort its a nice place to relax but definitely does not look and feel as a 5 * resort.

563,"After booking a week here through Luxury Escapes, we were a little nervous based on some of the reviews we read. If you are in a similar situation, please let us reassure you. The Village Coconut Island exceeded all our expectations from start to finish. Our airport and boat transfers were super easy, and although we arrived before the offical check in time, we were welcomed and invited to enjoy the amenities while we waited. Our villa was perfect for our family of 4. It was spacious, quiet and nicely furnished, with very good air conditioning and a gorgeous personal pool (which was cleaned every day, as were the larger pools). Beds were very comfortable. All staff we met were friendly and helpful. We were greeted with a smile at all times. Food and drinks were really good and catered for all tastes. There was plenty to choose from with the all inclusive package we had, and we also enjoyed a 50% discount at the beautiful Koko Restaurant. Trips organised by the tour desk were well run. We enjoyed visiting the sister island just a short boat ride away, where there were lovely clear waters for swimming. We also spent time on the mainland, exploring Phuket. An absolute highlight of our holiday was a day trip to Phi Phi Islands, with stops for snorkelling. We also enjoyed an afternoon of lovely massages as part of our package. We thought it was a nice touch to have the opportunity to meet the General Manager and his team over cocktails one night. Although we didn’t have time to ask the questions we wanted to, we were impressed with the personal response when we e.mailed upon our return home. We had some questions about the sustainability efforts of the resort, especially around the use of disposable plastic cups, bottles and straws. We were very reassured by the response and wished we had been around to help out with one of the regular beach clean up days. All in all, we had a fantastic holiday. We realise that no resort will ever be able to please everyone but we were extremely happy with our experience. A big shout out to the staff member we saw dealing with rude, unreasonable guests at the pier one day. These guests were clearly in the wrong and behaving very provocatively. The staff member handled the situation in a calm and professional manner. Thanks to everyone we encountered during our holiday and everyone behind the scenes.

564,"Ending our Thailand trip with a 7 day stay at Coconut Island,we arrived at our villa mid afternoon.Our Luxury Escapes deal included all inclusive meals and drinks.The food was superb-great choice of Asian dishes and European food.The Asian curries were not too spicy as is sometimes the case in Thailand and the highlight for me was the lobster curry which was so delicious and something which I have not encountered before and I consider myself a curry connoisseur! There was plenty of variety and I have to say their Margerita pizzas were outstanding and I for one do not have them regularly but on this trip ,had them at least three times.The staff at the resort are very helpful and friendly and nothing seems to be too much bother.I dont know how they manage to stay calm and collected in the searing heat and humidity we had during our stay.The accommodation was spacious and had plenty of wardrobe space and was surrounded by beautiful manicured gardens.","April 26, 2019","9    The Village Coconut Island Beach Resort

565,"Travelled to The Village between the 5th and 15th of April with my wife, and 2 children of 8 and 5 (B&B only). My personal experience of this hotel is this should be a 3 star - I generally think the western management have let this place down - after requesting to speak to them, they never appeared. I had 3 bad points from our stay:- We arrived after a long journey at 22:30 at reception, to then wait for 25 minutes without being offered water or any drinks whilst we waited (as we have been to Thailand before this is usually customary). Once this long check-in process was completed, we were told that the restaurant was closed at 23:00 - so we are not sure why they did not mention this to us when we first arrived, so we could have placed our food order considering this is an island with nothing outside the resort. One night we decided to go to the Asian fusion restaurant and booked a baby sitter for 19:00, and no one turned up, and reception kept saying she was on her way and would be there in 5 minutes - an hour later they arrived.This hotel is not eco-friendly at all, still using plastic cups and straws, and the beach shore line was covered in plastic which included plastic cups, straws, plastic bags etc (this was cleaned up much later in the week). Most residents commented on this. We had a villa room with a pool, which was excellent. It was cool and spacious, with private pool - we had a super king bed and the children had 2 single beds in their own room - this included a bathroom in each room. There is a kitchen with fridge and hot plates. There were beach towels and room towels. The Spa was really good and we took turns with different treatments. One late afternoon we went down with the children and swam in the hydro pool. There is a small shop on site, which is reasonable priced so drinks and small food items. The breakfast was good, and plentiful. The children could swim after breakfast, whilst we finished our coffee. The children enjoyed the slides and the large pool. The beach was hot and the children did not really play on the beach, but the water sports was easy to use, there was no fuss. I did swim in the sea a few times, but there was sometimes rubbish in the sea which put me off - the sister island is cleaner. The sister island is a worth while outing and is a close boat ride, and a good half-day adventure - clearer and cleaner water, and has a beach restaurant which is good. There is a floating restaurant, if you ask reception they will give you a lift to the pier where a long tail boat will take you to the floating platform. There is also a fish restaurant on the opposite pier, which also needs a long tail boat to take you across. Both were good. Getting on and off the island is fairly straight forward and included the resort package and 24 hours. You should book your times for coming over as in some cases when a large tour arrives, you could be limited on spaces on the boat. The mission of getting off and on boats, and then taxis to get to any local shops does get tedious. We generally got to relax and enjoy ourselves, however we decided to leave earlier and stay on the mainland for a change of scenery.","April 23, 2019","9    The Village Coconut Island Beach Resort

566,"Got an all inclusive package ie all meals and alcohol/drinks included. Just as well because it is very isolated from the main part of Phuket and thus very difficult to get to local restaurants and bars. If you just want to relax by the pool it is ok. Definitely not 5 star as it is looking rather tired around the edges. Would rate as 3-4 star these days. Room and bed were decent and clean. Staff were friendly and helpful. Meals were quite good with the “Themed” lunches and dinners the highlight. Some basic but enjoyable evening entertainment on some nights. A major gripe was the room aircon. It was just before the wet season so daily temperatures got to 36-37 degrees Celsius. We like our afternoon siesta but the aircon could not cope with these temperatures so the room was like a sauna even with the aircon on max cold. It did cool down enough for night sleep. In summary, a reasonable holiday but will we come back? I have to say NO!This says it all really.","April 22, 2019","9    The Village Coconut Island Beach Resort

567,"We enjoyed a calm Phuket by being a little bit away and apart. Coconut Island is a small island in front of Phuket. A 5mn boat (very convenient) will take you to Phuket. It departs every 30mn. We had a villa with private pool, and we loved it... I’m not sure we ´ll be able to travel differently now Restaurants are nice, service and staff are so kind. People who choose The Village Coconut are not looking for the hot / burning Phuket, it makes it a perfect place to come as a couple or a family with kids. We did not try the kids club (not our kind) but seemed ok and organized. Thank you to the staff and the Swedish (?!) director who welcomed us.

574,"This was my first time in Phuket and Thailand overall, had the pleasure to stay in this hotel for 3 nights. I had one bedroom private pool villa sea view this was one of the best experience I had ever had. We had a very nice and easy check in and we were welcomed by the night manager David who was very nice and helpful as we have arrived around 3 am in the morning. During the whole stay staff were very helpful nice and providing best experience and also our check out was also easy and nice. We have tried the spa and also was one of a kind and you will never forget it. Around the subject that hotel is expensive yes it’s higher that anything you could get from Phuket Centre but if prices were compared to other hotels it’s not expensive.

575,"I was a bit worried about some of the reviews in here when booking. But as soon as the ferry cruised up to the Coconut Pier I was blown away!This resort is one of the best I have every stayed in, and I have stayed in many as my family is in the hotel industry.For the price you pay it is amazing quality. These reviewers giving bad reviews should have spent 20 times the amount to stay at the Ritz.The beach bar is magical. Wonderful music played throughout the day. Lovely cocktails. Absolutely MUST do the all inclusive other wise very expensive. All inclusive well worth it. The food is wonderful!! You MUST try Koko one night at least. The food and location is next level!! They have a very experienced bar tender there too who make faultless cocktails. Even though its 50% off for the all inclusive it is still well worth it for a special treat. It is all class.Rooms are cleaned daily and bed very comfortable. My only suggestion is that they need to put a door on the master bedroom toilet in the garden pool villas. The bathroom is all open plan but not having privacy in the toilet is a design fault. We don't really want to be hearing our partners go to the toilet in the night... or ever. We also thought it would be nice to have a tv in the bedrooms. Just a small suggestion!The multiple ways of getting to the island due to the tides was fun. We enjoyed getting the traditional long boat when super low tide.No, the beach isn't good, barely swimmable but the pool is lovely and I highly recommend going to the sister island 5 minute ferry ride away for some beach time. The ferrys are free from the pier daily at 10.45am. They pick you up at 2.45pm. There is a restaurant there and lots of loungers. Beautiful clear swimming water. The grand beach front villas are AMAZING. Our friends had one.I recommend Kims Massage in Phuket town. Super cheap and great quality.All in all, a beautiful experience for the last 7 days. I want to bring all of my friends and family back one day. Thank you to the gorgeous friendly staff who make the resort what it is.","April 7, 2019","9    The Village Coconut Island Beach Resort

581,"We booked two rooms for four nights (for 3 adults and two children) and left after one night. I’m sorry to say that we were disappointed with our rooms upon first walking in. They did not look like what was pictured in the photos on Expedia and the quality was much lower than we were expecting. There was a musty, mouldy smell in both rooms and we could see cobwebs and dust (especially under the beds). One room had peeling wallpaper and the other room had a significant number of bugs crawling around (mostly ants, which seem to be all over in Phuket).The bathrooms have openings to the outside in the back wall with screens over them. The sound from a crying child in the room next door carried over and it sounded as though she was in the same room as us. One of the bathrooms seemed to be more modern than the one in the other guest room we booked, however the faucet was rusty and the manufacturer’s stickers had never been removed so it looked like a shoddy reno. Our final concern was that we were on the ground floor and the only entrance to our rooms were sliding glass doors that didn’t have very sturdy locking mechanisms. The pool and grounds are mostly quite lush and pretty however there was one patio umbrella covered in black mildew which seemed out of place in comparison with the rest of the pool area. Our kids enjoyed the pool the one afternoon we were there. The reception area should have been our first clue that this hotel was not what we were expecting, as it was a bit dingy and very dated. The reception staff (we spoke with two different people during our stay) were both so lovely, though. They felt bad when I told them we were leaving and they offered to move us to different rooms, however we felt that the lack of cleanliness in both rooms couldn’t just be a one-off and was likely indicative of how the whole place was run. We only had four nights on Phuket and we simply couldn’t picture having to come “home” to those rooms every day after our outings. Therefore we made the decision within one hour of arriving to forfeit our room fees (non-refundable paid in advance) and spent the rest of the evening researching and booking another hotel. Got a last minute deal at The Old Phuket Resort and moved there early the next morning. I am very laid back and don’t typically sweat the small stuff. This hotel simply was a mismatch with our expectations. I think if you’re looking for a cheap place with a pretty pool this will fit the bill, but beware that not all the rooms are as nice as the ones posted online. Hopefully my photos will help you make your decision. ","August 21, 2018","10    Garden Home Kata

583,"We booked a budget room for 1100 baht so it was a cheap hotel and it was clean and quiet but I have marked it down because the safe was broken and may be we were unlucky with the room but it had a wooden door at the back that went outside and was a bit odd and felt a bit insecure. Other than that the room was big, comfy bed and fridge with waters and a bar of soap. We didn't really like the area either as you have to cross a really busy road to get in to town. I may be marking it down a bit as we paid the same price in kata for a room and it was far superior with modern bathroom and shower gel and shampoo and if we hadn't got that to compare it to, it may have got a 4?","March 29, 2018","10    Garden Home Kata

587,"This hotel is a lovely little gem in the midst of a busy area. The staff were friendly and accommodating. We asked for several items and were always met with a smile.We booked the family room and it accommodated 5 people nicely. The room itself was clean and efficient - not glamorous. There were basic amenities and a large refrigerator for keeping food/drink cold. The only issue in the room for me was the mould in the bathroom. Which I imagine given the humidity and reliance on guests to use the fan is difficult to maintain. The security lights outside stay on all night - I realise they are for safety but they are very bright !The pool area was lovely, we were in and out of the pool all day. Our room was on the other side of the side road, but this was not an issue for us. If I had young children I would have preferred to be on the same side as the pool.We ate breakfast twice at the hotel, it was good and the price comparable. The coffee could knock your socks off !The location - yes it is just off a busy street and the tour buses travel up and down at a ridiculous speed. I would say the traffic seems to follow some basic rules, which you don’t always get when traveling ! You can cross at the bottom of the street at a set of lights and safely make your way to the beach. We walked to and from the beach and local shops two or three times a day with no issues. Nice and close to the grocery store, beaches and restaurants without all the busy surroundings.","November 18, 2017","10    Garden Home Kata

Not the hotel's fault really, but still...* A cockroach fell down the ventilation the first day. After that, we luckily didn't see more. There were some ants and mosquitos even though we had the door closed. I think the net over the vents should be fixed, it probably have some gaps.Ok, now let's be positive!* The staff was nice, especially the young man and woman, as they spoke very very good English.* The pool area was nice, also suitable for small kids! There were enough chairs for everybody.* Location - quiet, perfect if you want to get quality sleep. * Room cleaned daily and 4 bottles of free water provided daily.* Bathroom brand new, very very fresh and clean.* There is a great local restaurant right at the main road from the hotel.

593,"We had two separate stays at the Garden Home this fall. 37 days altogether with a visit to Chiang Mai in the middle. The hotel was nice enough to allow us to leave a bag in our room between stays so we wouldn't have to lug what we didn't need to Chiang Mai and back, so that was helpful. Room was cleaned very well every day. We weren't too impressed with our first room and was no problem getting changed to a different room for a nominal fee for the portion of the stay booked through Expedia. They didn't charge extra for the portion booked through their website.Our room was on the second floor with view of the pool. We were very happy with our room. Shower worked well with better pressure then we had on our stays at the Boomerang Hotel up the road in previous years. Also nice to have a bigger fridge then usual hotel mini fridges. That was very helpful. And the patio was very nice to enjoy when it wasn't smokey out. (either neighbors smoking on their patio's) or general yard waste burning from neighboring properties - which being an asthmatic is was bothersome for me and I would head for the room. Sometimes you could smell plastic burning which of course is a strong carcinogen. Many evenings in a row it was too smokey to sit on the patio. This I'm sure is beyond the control of the hotel. One area that could be improved would be the number of television channels. There is only about 16 channels altogether which is very small, only one English News channel (CNN) and some of the available channels didn't work sometimes for a few days at a time. If we were only there for a few days it wouldn't be an issue but we were there 37 nights altogether so that would have been much better if there was more choice. One doesn't go to Thailand of course to watch Television but most hotels have much more choice.Pool is very large and the best asset of the hotel. They could use a few more chairs and loungers around the pool at times, and the chairs could be cleaned better or more often. Staff were quite friendly in general but communication was very sparse amongst the majority of the staff as they don't speak English. The smoke from neighboring properties thou at times was disgusting, for that reason I doubt we will go back. Also the pollution that was much, much worse at Kata Beach then previous visits was disgusting. One shouldn't have to swim in stinky water. Karon beach was still quite awesome, thou when the waves are too high one can't get past the waves very easily to swim freely. So for us, the combination of bad air and ocean water on this trip makes it much less likely that we will go back to Phuket. We'll go back to Thailand, but not Phuket.","January 10, 2017","10    Garden Home Kata

594,"We stayed 8 nights at Garden Home Kata, we had a Superior room at the first floor with garden view and balcony. The room was nice, clean and spacious, equipped with air conditioner, ceiling fan, bathroom with shower (recently renovated). Loved the fact that it is owned by a local family, everyone was friendly, Pang at the reception speaks very good English, was very professional and helpful from the moment we made the booking and during all our stay. His aunt that usually serves breakfast is also a very nice lady and even though she doesn't speak English she does her best to accommodate all requests. Booking the airport transfers, renting the motorcycle and handing in the laundry directly to them proved out to be a very good idea and all ran smoothly (we needed an airport transfer early in the morning and it was there at 4 am sharp as we requested) and saved us a lot of time and trouble(as bargaining and punctuality in Thailand are a little bit of a issue). This place is suitable for both families and couples and you need a bike/motorcycle/car to properly visit the place, for us it was a relaxing oasis after the long motorcycle rides we took to visit the island. The only down side was the Wi-Fi connection, it didn't work very well, but there is a computer at the reception and that was really useful. Thank you for such a nice stay, greetings to all the family and staff!","January 8, 2017","10    Garden Home Kata

600,"We stayed here for 4 nights in June and were initially given a large family room on the ground floor. The room would have been fine except that it had obviously not been used for some time and the mouldy smell was so bad that it gave my daughter an asthma attack. We asked to move rooms and were initially told if we didn't like this room we should find another hotel. I told them that we had already paid (turns out we hadn't), so they moved us to the suite which was a two room family room upstairs. It was ok, but is somewhat worn out and some of the floor (bits of wood) was sticking up and quite dangerous and all the blankets needs replacing. However, bear in mind that this place is cheap for Phuket, so we decided it was ok for another 3 nights. The pool area is really lovely and has plenty of sun beds and I liked the fact that the hotel is not too modern. The 'cafe' which seemed to be part of reception was closed (it's low season) and not even drinking water was on sale, luckily you are only a short walk to a restaurant on the corner and various supermarkets on the main road. The old lady behind the counter was not particularly friendly, oh well you can't win them all. We ended up paying when we left and then were charged again by Booking.com, so we are currently in the process of getting our money back for the extra payment.I wouldn't rush to go back there as there are other, similar places on offer, but I would return due to it's location (up a quiet street), nice pool and price.","July 14, 2016","10    Garden Home Kata

605,"We came here in august which is the low-season in Thailand. Because of this there were some renovations going on so we got a free upgrade for our room so we wouldn't be bothered by the noise (which we didn't hear at all, even at the pool where the renovations were taking place). When we got to the room we unpacked but later discovered that our airco wasn't working so we got another room which was a floor higher. We would first have dinner and then move our stuff, but when we got back there was a note on our door that there was a free room on the same floor so it would be easier for us to move our stuff!Later we went over to book our trip to Koh Phangan which they took care of but the next day my girlfriend got sick so we had to delay our trip and they took care of this as well without any extra costs. We could also stay at the hotel for an extra night (ofcourse we had to pay for this).When my girlfriend wasn't better the next day they helped us out to get a doctor. We also couldn't go out for dinner so they borrowed us a waterboiler and some cups.There have been many more things that the staff helped us with which made this such a great stay. It might be that because it was so quiet (only 5 other guests at the hotel) that they were able to provide such a great service but still, the staff was excellent.10/10 would definitely stay here again.","September 1, 2015","10    Garden Home Kata

And their rates are quite fair.I chose to stay in a double bedroom with bathroom: the room was huge, everything was spotlessly clean and no beasts around as it is often the case when staying on tropical islands. There was no wi-fi in the room but in the lobby there is a PC available for guests.There is a nice swimming-pool in a lovely garden adorned with exotic flowers and statues from the local culture.The hotel is about hundred metres away from the main road, which ensures good night's sleep. Its location is quite ideal also because you can choose to go on foot either to Kata or to Karon beach, both about 15 minutes away. The hotel bar serves good breakfasts: I had a scrambled eggs on toast and it was delicious, although not the cheapest option in Kata. The only drawback was that being in low season, there was hardly anyone around and the place looked a bit lonely.","May 20, 2015","10    Garden Home Kata

We arrived late and were greeted by Pang and Tong who had stayed up especially to check us in which was lovely. They were very quick communicating via email regarding arranging our pick up from the airport and transfer to the hotel which was completely hassle free. The room we had was basic but spotlessly clean and serviced each day, and for the price you certainly couldn't ask for anything more, nothing was too much trouble. Kata beach is nice, but we spent everyday sat by the pool and ate most meals at the small, cheap restaurant just at the end of the road from the hotel as you simply couldn't beat the food there!! The centre of town with night markets, lots of restaurants and bars is only a 10-15 minute walk away so this hotel is perfectly located. There are also a number of supermarkets nearby to get supplies from which are cheaper than buying from the shops right in town. Overall, this is an excellent place to stay and I look forward to staying here in the future.

However the hotel was amazing.For the price we didn't expect a lot but we where pleasantly surprised. Our room was big, clean and when we finally figured out the air con we where flying. About the air con, some of the units are wired wrong so setting the temperature to a high temperature yields a cold stream of air. Wish we discovered this on our first night.The pool is lovely, if you are there between October and January, Sue and Pete, who stay therefor 3 months can be found on the left hand side as you come in the plate and there's nothing they don't know about the hotel or the area.

I was very satisfied with the overall customer service they provided. We had hired a Taxi from the airport to the hotel directly. First we were a little skeptical about the rates, but when we figured out about the market rates we found their rate to be very reasonable. The hotel is located near to the Kata beach, which is around 15 minutes of walk. The beach in itself is located in a calm environment and so is the hotel, away from the hustle bustle of the city.

We walked down Patak Road looking at almost all the hotels/rooms etc until we found on the left a sign advertising Boomerang Village. On our way we passed the Garden Home and decided to have a look. Well what a find!!!We were offered 3 different room types and prices and had decided to have the middle priced room. We then made the mistake of 'going away to think about it@ as an hour later we had lost that option so ended up with the top end. We were however not dissapointed. The room was huge, cleaned everyday with clean towels, private balcony, aircon, TV. fridge and safe.We had our own kettle so we could make our own drinks but there is a little cafe onsite. We ended our Phuket dventure here and stayed for 12 nights!!!! The pool is wonderful bonus as it is good 20 minute walk to the beach across the main road but do-able and along the road with all the bars and resturants and in the shade mostly. The owners were very helpful and pleasant. The little Thai kitchen at the end of the street is great for a cheap meal day or night. The only thing we were surpised bout was that we did not get complimentary water as this seems standard in Thailand whatever the standard of accomodation.

Rooms are fine, clean and spacious, the bathroom was clean, the inroom safe worked fine ... overall a very good stay. The mosquito count was up during our stay but that was due to the weather not the hotel.

629,"This is about our 5th visit to this adult only resort. We love it! Ocean front, sensational sunsets, amazing pools, umbrellas & lounges. If you want location, views, beach walks this is the place. Take advantage of the pool massages or the day spa salon near reception.From being welcomed at the door by staff like Come(soccer coach on the side), amazing wait staff at breakfast like Nikorn, Kong, Thainan & the lovely smiling chef Plai to the management team of NOK & Ling Ling. Just like coming home.The rooms are clean, spacious & room housekeeping staff like Oi help you with any room needs you have. 3 complimentary water bottles are supplied each day, just make sure you leave the empty bottles in your room. We were welcomed with a complimentary fruit platter, flowers and a decorative elephant on the bed. Love how you can stand in the shower & look at that beach view. We always request far end top floor rooms for that view. The air conditioner is a blessed relief from the heat. Just a tip if you don’t like a firm to hard bed just request a mattress topper from housekeeping, works a treat.Breakfasts are awesome, with egg station, fresh fruits, British, Asian & European option stations available. Eat on the deck or inside. Remember to order your coffees, lattes or Cappuccinos, we ordered double shots. Lots of unreal restaurants across the roads, cheap eats or a bit more expensive. Local shops, chemists, money exchanges & market stores available in walking distance. Tides often bring in logs etc to the beach front & the resort clean up this each morning or through the day.","July 13, 2019","11    Beyond Resort Karon

630,"75% of the staff looked like they didn't want to be there. The room smelt of damp and the wardrobe smelt of sweat. Ants were visible in the room both on dresser tables and floor. The hotel is very outdated and in need of a facelift. Many trip hazards by the pool. Ann at the Taxi & Tour desk is a waste of space. Was not interested in helping when making tour enquiries. So much so i had to walk away. Pointless her being there.Taxi to airport is overpriced! They charge 1600 Baht but you can book it yourself for 800 Baht.Breakfast was ok, beautiful sunsets from the pool and a stone's throw from the beach.Cleaners are nice and the chef at the egg station is polite and nice.","June 22, 2019","11    Beyond Resort Karon

631,"There is something strange about this hotel that is very difficult to describe. It is evident from the moment you step into the lobby and permeates throughout the hotel.The interaction with the reception staff was not up to the usual friendly Thai standards and walking down the dark antiquated hallway to our room was quite depressing, definitely not what you want to feel on a tropical holiday.The room did not impress either and the strange mix of renovation and dilapidation was evident here too.The staff in the hotel appear to be working under duress with an obvious lack of the famous Thai smiles and hospitality.Quite frankly I’m very pleased our stay here was only for two nights. I will never be coming back and I advise you all to stay away as there are far better options in the area for the same price.","June 6, 2019","11    Beyond Resort Karon

No doubt 20 or so years ago this was a top spot but they have not spent a penny on it since. It is a great location with unbeatable views but the room decor is worn out, we could feel the grit on the floor as we worked in. General cleanliness is poor. In Thailand you can grow almost anything, but they had plastic flowers inside and their lawns and gardens were a disgrace.

The beach location of the hotel was the reason we booked and it did not disappoint, as we walked into our room the view was Fantastic. We were looking for somewhere quiet yet central for our first visit to Phuket. We loved the sea vie and used to sit on the balcony to watch the sun setting which was amazing. Our room was spacious and clean. The scales in the room was a nice touch. There are plenty of shops and restaurants outside and conveniently situated a short walk (10-15 minutes) to Kata beach. Buffet breakfast was simple, sufficient and nice. The coffee was the fresh brewed type. This is the best. The nice omelettes and bacon were cooked fresh to order. The service and all the staff were great! The Location is what lifts this hotel to the next level 10 steps to the white sandy beach.

635,"Beyond Karon is in the middle of the Karon hub which means you have access to a lot of amenities at a stones throw such as eateries, mini marts, stalls and pharmacies. It is also set right on Karon Beach and runs as an adults only hotel, so no disruptive kids taking over the pools. The rooms were clean and well equipped with comfy beds, a chaise style seat and bathroom facilities (shower only). As well as tv, bar fridge, AC etc. Room opened up to a sizeable balcony over looking the ocean which was beautiful. It was exactly what I needed for my stay. Breakfast buffet was provided daily and was suited to my needs, the resort did not over cater the buffet which was good so there was little waste. The staff at Beyond Karon were always helpful and friendly, especially concierge Come (Sutha) who was always accommodating and friendly greeting us and chatting to my mum and I each day. The only thing I was a bit frustrated about was that the rooms did not have an iron and ironing board and that housekeeping did not often provide enough replacement toilet paper or tea/coffee when required. These were small issues though.Overall I was impressed with my stay at Beyond Karon and would stay here again. ","May 10, 2019","11    Beyond Resort Karon

The rooms are clean and have all that is required for a comfortable holiday. My room unfortunately had an adjoining door (which was paper thin) to the room next door and it was very noisy. This room was a revolving door to 1 and 2 night guests who had no thought for any other guests - drinking, swearing and partying to all hours of the night. The breakfast was great, not too much and not too little. The staff were, as always, very friendly and accommodating.

The staff were nice enough though and put a bunch of extra bedding on to make it softer, but I usually expect a comfy bed form a nice hotel. The pool was basic and really warm, so in the afternoon it wasn’t really refreshing. The one thing I loved was the adults only aspect, you really notice it at the pool and at breakfast, so nice and quiet.Breakfast buffet had an egg station, which was nice, and had most of the things you’d expect. I did like how it’s the only hotel right on Karon beach, so it was perfect for beach walks, I got stung swimming in the water twice though, so be careful.

638,"We have just returned from staying at this hotel for 10 days. We last stayed here 4 years ago. I enjoy coming back because its right on the beach and the sunsets are amazing. This time, we were on the ground floor. Nice to have your own loungers and easy access to the pool. I personally prefer the higher levels, but ground floor is not bad at all.Reception is always friendly and willing to help. Ling Ling, the manager, was always walking around greeting everyone with a smile. The rooms were clean and bathrooms contained the basics. Jim, the lady that cleaned our room was so sweet and friendly. Always smiling and ready to assist in any way possible.Our air con broke one day and within 30 minutes we had a whole new unit installed. Breakfast is great. You have to try the Asian foods especially congee which is porridge made of rice and you can add lemongrass and coriander. The young man at the egg counter (sorry can't remember his name) makes great Thai omelettes too. Staff are always friendly.The pools were fine. There was always sun loungers available. There was music at the bar, but wish we could hear it at the main pool. Drinks are a bit expensive, but I guess that is all hotels. The beach towels are a little tired, and overall the place probably needs a bit of an update. Sometimes, the beach had a bit of debris washing up in front of the hotel. Perhaps the hotel could do a little clean up in the mornings. It would just do wonders for the view. I would definitely stay there again. It has everything I need on holiday, a clean room, a perfect view, friendly staff, 2 pools to cool down in, a few steps to the beach, snorkeling by the rocks and within walking distance of loads of restaurants, ATM's and shops.","April 29, 2019","11    Beyond Resort Karon

639,Just checked out after a 7 night stay and kind of disappointed with the hotel and it being 4 star. Nothing 4 star about it. Basic stuff and nothing which I can truly say was 4 star.Room 108 has the bar right infront of it blocking the view. When asked to move we were told hotel was fully booked. Really disappointed as this was a trip for my husbands birthday.Swimming pool was filthy with dead bugs and sand in it and the filter seemed to be leaking into the pool itself so never used the swimming pool as filter clearly dont work.Breakfast was very very limited and very boring. Some days we didn't bother eating there and ate out. Everyday was the same old weird stuff to eat.Had private patio but never had a sun block umbrella despite every other room having one. Could of asked for 1 but its besides the point.. the service should be on point and not having to ask for stuff.Very basic amenities for a 4 star hotel.The hotel itself didn't have any sort of entertainment and was pretty boring to be in unless you went out.Wouldn't personally not book this one again.,"April 19, 2019","11    Beyond Resort Karon

The staff were helpful and welcoming having a cold wipe and drink on arrival. Everything was explained to us about the safe and how everything works in the room.

Breakfasts were very nicely presented with lots of choice.We ate lobster in the restaurant one lunchtime which was superb.The hotel itself was clean and very low key, we didn’t partake In The evening entertainment so cannot comments. The hotel guests were from many different countries so expect that if you stay here, all very friendly.Sun beds were reserved everyday by hotel guests ,we didn’t have a problem getting two even if we didn’t reserve them early. There were plenty of umbrellas too.Karon beach is long and sandy and not too busy, it has a lovely family feel to it.We snorkelled off the rocks right by the hotel and saw many different fish species.

The sunbeds are reserved from early early morning and there is no chance to get help from the staff. If you arrive late they just ask why you didn’t wake up earlier.The hotel itself feels dark and you get the feeling of walking in a hospital with the darren and soulless interior.Only + is the location by the beach.

652,"First thing, the staff here are incredibly friendly and made our stay so pleasant. First problem, we booked premier room which is on level 3, but where given room on level 2 when we got there because they said level 3 rooms all booked out - yes we booked one of those. We got upgraded to the top suite for the nigh but had to chang rooms the next day which wasnt great. Getting a taxi there from the airport - may be best to use their transfer service as pretty sure we got ripped off by taxi. Second thing, people kept putting out towels befe the sum was out to reserve chairs by the pool. There is a policy against this but staff didn't start policing it til our last morning there.Beer in the mini bar is expensive. Bamboo Mart out front has wider variety for a third of the price. I just got beer out there and took it back. Pool bar was nice too with god selection of cocktails.We were there for new years too which was a big event and a great spot to watch fireworks from.Pool was nice and not too cold. Great access to beach where the water was amazing. Great massage spots on the beach, by the pool or out on the street. Full body fo an hour is 500 baht ($20 Australian) or one hour foot massage 300 baht. Some great restaurants near by too. On the Rocks next door on the beach was beautiful and Villa Kata across the road was cheap, but very good. Also if you want to gton a tour, there is a guy directly across the road who sells fmdifferent tours wit reputable companies. We got the James Bond island tour wit a great company at a fraction of the price we would have paid online. But to the hotel. Rooms were good. Premier room had coffee machine which was good. Beds a little hard, but fine to sleep in. Rooms were clean and spacious with great view of the city.Breakfast buffet was great every morning too. Some asia food, but mostly cereals, yoghurts, fruit, toast, hot food and an egg station with fresh eggs cooked to your liking. Not bad coffee too.Good spot to stay, quieter side of phuket. A lot less crowds than Patong or Kata. Still am some good bars close by if you want to get out.","January 3, 2019","11    Beyond Resort Karon

653,"Stayed here for a week January 2018 - I know, been meaning to review but now have more time. We're shown to Room 229 on ground floor end of corridor - we immediately went back to reception due to the following: Air Con didn't work, Lights flickered, Workmen outside front cutting trees, Drums of chemical outside balcony (which was tiny), room smelled of damp - not happy bunnies after a long flight. Due to hotel being fully booked, we had to wait an hour or so before being offered another room, which was alot better on 1st floor. Hired a moped directly opposite the hotel for approx £120 for 6 days - roads good, very busy but ok if you're experienced, cars seem to give way to mopeds at roundabouts! Went out every day sight seeing around Phuket, Big Buddha, Sea View Elephant Camp - baby elephant chained up - shame, ate out every night - had great fun, ate at Buffalo Steakhouse our last night - bit pricy but worth it - beef stroganoff was delicious.Kebab place just outside on the right - great for cheap lunch.CONS: Safe and fridge were ground level, so not ideal if you have bad back or knee prob or any health problem.Pools very small, not enough sunbeds to accommodate when full so people queing in mornings to stand by favourite beds before pool opened at 7am. Pool beds like sardines, ok if you're a slim Jim.Buffet breakfast mediocre - no pancake station, coffee was waiter served and not that hot, be nice if they had self service coffee machine, variety of food was limited and usually started to run out if you were late.PROS: Right on the beachAdults only - peace and quietRooms nice and clean, comfy big bed, good TV reception and choice of channelsGreat location - everything on the doorstep - supermarts, restaurants, shops, etc.Overall, enjoyable holiday.Third time in Thailand, noticed prices alot more expensive.","December 17, 2018","11    Beyond Resort Karon

654,"This adults only hotel is right on the beachfront of Karon beach, tucked into a corner. Beachfront hotels don’t really exist in Karon, most are set back from the road however there are a few that you can get directly to the beach from. The beach is public so if you want to lie on the beach you either have to bring something to lie on yourself (towels are provided) as there are no sunloungers (or buy one of the cheap mats they sell in all the local shops) or hire a sunlounger and parasol about 300 yards further down the beach. The pool area is very peaceful and has two pools, one with a swim up bar, however it is a little cramped due to limited space. The sunloungers are quite on top of each other which if the hotel was really busy could be annoying. Only half the loungers were ever taken while we stayed here. You can lie here and listen to the waves lap at the shore all day long. Breakfast is tasty, the waiter service is a little haphazard, taking drinks to wrong people, not offering drinks to people despite seating them, having to ask for things a few times but on the whole it’s fine as it’s only a small hotel anyway. Water provided in the room but only two bottles a day with a threat of charge if removed from the room which tickled me. No beach towel exchange but I’m sure they would if you asked, good for the environment anyway, however yet another hotel offering not to change towels unless on the floor etc, who then come in and change the towels. These signs are next to useless wherever I go I find. All round good quiet hotel in Karon with bars and restaurants and supermarkets and shops on your doorstep.","December 3, 2018","11    Beyond Resort Karon

Our own room was on the middle floor with a fantastic view but we could not seat outside or have the balcony doors open as we were surrounded by smokers on their balconies.

656,"An older style resort that is being renovated with probably the best views of any resort in the area. The rooms were spacious and our balcony had a direct view of the ocean. The cleaning staff were friendly and honest (showing me where some money had dropped on the floor, which they could easily have pocketed) and also did a great job of cleaning. Breakfast was good but the pastries were always dry, maybe as they were near the open doorway. The wait staff were always friendly and helpful. We had a really nice dinner in the restaurant one evening, we thought it was great value and you can’t beat the view. We also watched several sunsets near the bar area, enjoying a cocktail as the sun set. The pool area was also nice, helped by the fact that there were no kids running around and we had no trouble getting a sun bed. A perfect place to relax with a pool and ocean view and a cocktail by your side. The Bamboo Mart which is almost next door to the resort was handy for drinks to enjoy on the balcony. Also the crepe stand and ice cream stand outside were great too. Close to many restaurants. Some new towels and a freshen up to the massage/nail salon outdoor area would be a good idea for first impressions but other than that it was fantastic.

657,"One of the best hotel that close to the beach, great location, good food, good service and peace!! Also, all staff is very nice and friendly, they always greet us “Sawadeeca and Sawadeecup” when I went to breakfast or walk through the lobby. And they will greet me again when I come back, even I went shopping for 5 minutes at Bamboo. Moreover, first impression here is the young trainee at the lobby can speak chinese very good, she help me a lot. (because I’m not good at english as much), I’ve been to many hotels, but this is the first time that found someone who speaks chinese well. I was impressed with the staff’s service in this hotel (especially the staff at the lobby), but housekeeper does not smile much. Anyway, thank you for the good experiences here :)","November 6, 2018","11    Beyond Resort Karon

660,"This is our first stay in Thailand, the hotel is not as big as some of the others in Karon but its location is by far the the best, it close to lots shops and restaurants, but most of all its the only hotel on the beach, the veiw's are stunning, all the rooms have sea veiws, our room is on the lowest floor next to the pool, which is great as no worrying about getting a bed round the pool as you have 2 right outside your doors only 10meter's from the pool. The staff are very pleasant and helpful the even helped me to arrange a beautiful bouquet of flowers for my wife for our 25th wedding anniversary while we where there. The food in the hotel is very good, much better than most of the restaurants in the area and you will pay a similar price, unless you want the cheap street food that is, which is something else all together.To some up its in a great spot, its clean and friendly, food is great, the service is good and its very peaceful and quiet as its adults only, all you can here is the waves from the beach...Nearly forgot the free breakfast buffet is very good too....","October 16, 2018","11    Beyond Resort Karon

The room was nice, comfortable and kept spotlessly clean. The best toiletries I've come across in all 4 hotels visited, generous and the hair conditioner left my hair silky soft.Breakfast had lots of choice and the bacon served was tasty and crispy. Plates cleared away efficiently with a smile.I'd like to mention that on our first day here we went for a walk on the beach and left the safe open with all our money and valuables on show. Although honesty is expected, it's easy to think the worst. When we got back nothing was touched, our room had been cleaned so we were very happy.We didn't eat there in the evening, the only reason being was that there was so much choice near by.

665,"We arrived quite late, around 18:00 hours. When we checked-in, we wanted to book a tour for the next day to James Bond Island (Khao Phing Kan) and found a brochure from which to pick the boat. The staff were really pushy, they wanted us to book from a particular tour company who wanted 50,000THB to charter a boat. The company we had selected wanted 38,000THB. Staff continued to push for their preferred tour company, no doubt they get commission, when we said ‘no’ two of the staff just walked off and said nothing in a mood - which we found quite rude. In the room there is no universal charging point. You have to bring your own adaptors and the resort do not provide them. We have travelled throughout Thailand and stayed at hotels/resorts with similar price points, this was the first without a universal charging point and no adapters. The selection at breakfast was poor as was dinner options. There was only full fat milk, limited cereals, teas, etcetera. Tea was limited to a tea bag. At this price you would expect there to be a variety of tea to select from. During breakfast, the resort had deployed plastic canopies to reduce wind. When we asked for them to be raised, because the wind was not a problem, the staff said no it’s too windy. We had to move ourselves to a table away from the breakfast area, all under protest from staff. It really wasn’t windy enough to warrant the plastic canopy that obscured the beautiful view. Breakfasts did not start until 7 AM, the latest breakfast start time on our trip. There is no gym on site. The resort offer you a taxi to go 10 minutes down the road to a gym. This is frankly ridiculous. In any event, the gym doesn’t open until 9AM, which for anyone that trains in the morning is not suitable and eats into your day too much.The room cleaning service didn’t arrive until after 13:00 in the afternoon. We went out to the zip wire at 8AM and expected to return back to clean rooms. They were not prepared. In the end we had to ask the room service to do our rooms. There was also no turndown service.The rooms are small and basic, this is not a luxury resort.","September 12, 2018","11    Beyond Resort Karon

666,"Have been to Phuket several times. Staying at Karon and Patong both very nice beach side places. We a nice 7 day break at Beyond but be aware that if you are looking for proper resort style accommodation this is not for you.Having said that if you are just looking for a good B&B hotel with a nice pool and no kids this is a good option. Right in the middle of town on the beach. Rooms are adequate and ours walked onto the pool which was great. The hotel is dated has a damp smell, the bathrooms have mould and ours has been refurbished. Food is OK. However the Staff are appalling. They are lazy and most barely speak any English it is very faulty towers like and we just gave up. They are lovely and polite but just unaware of service standards. It’s managements fault not there’s. We asked for two wine glasses and two glasses of coke turned up with two people just guessing what we wanted. I asked for some more coat hangers and got hung up on three times them someone arrived at the door wanting to know what I wanted and I had to actually show them a hanger. I rang and asked for and extra towel for my hair and that just never arrived. They also never give you a fresh pool towel you have to keep using the one you have and hang it out to dry each night. There is a pool person but they never come near you, you have to walk to the bar and order while they watch you, then they will bring it back to you and then never clear the glass away so the ants swarm on it. The pool people spend most of their time chatting at the outdoor massage ladies while ignoring the guests. The massage by the way is reasonable and very good.We travel o’seas usually 3 times a year so this is an honest and accurate appraisal of where this hotel sits. So if you are happy with what’s on offer for a reasonable price I think it’s a good option. I read the reviews before booking and can honestly say the 4 and 5 stars can only be written by nice people who have not travelled a lot and have not stayed in actual 5 star hotels.

670,"After being booked into Beyond Resort Kata by our travel agent instead of this resort at Karon we arrived here 3 days later after requesting a transfer. What a pleasant relief, the staff were happy and helpful and the hotel was only 80 rooms instead of 280 rooms at the Kata resort not to mention so many children. The reason we chose this resort was the child-free policy and it was not disappointing. Our room was on the first floor which is actually ground entry level, only one flight down to the pool and on the same floor as the buffet breakfast. The views from our balcony over the ocean were great, unfortunately with such rough seas there was a fair bit of rubbish on the beach although this did not detract from the views. Our room appears to have been recently renovated so we had no complaints with the room or the bathroom. The bed was huge but a little hard for our liking, same with the pillows. I would suggest that the overlay on the mattresses needs replacing as it was stained. The pools and pool bar were pleasant and the staff very accommodating and friendly. Looking out over the water from the pool bar was amazing. Drink and food prices were a little pricey but not over the top. The location of this resort is fantastic, just outside are money changers, seven 11 shops and other great restaurants (we suggest Red Chopsticks for great food and drinks reasonably priced). Dino Park is also a great place to eat and drink. The resort buffet does not have a great range of variety for westerners, a lot of the food is exposed to the elements, flies landing on it and food drying out - should be covered. Friendly breakfast staff filling coffee for you and removal of used dishes prompt. Only a couple of other negatives: the shower pressure is low and runs boiling hot to cold, there is a lot of sand on the room floor, the pool towels need replacing as they are old and thin. All in all our stay was excellent, the outdoor restaurant had great views and take advantage of the happy hour drink prices. Would highly recommend this resort for those wanting a more relaxed holiday. The staff are a great credit to this hotel.","August 3, 2018","11    Beyond Resort Karon

671,"Aussie couple who went for 3 nights for part of our honeymoon. This hotel is three stars at best. I'm amazed at the 5 star reviews that have been given here and question this entirely as we made the decision based on these reviews. As soon as we got to the hotel we went on trip advisor again and read all the 1, 2 and 3 star reviews and now understand the real opinions of those who have stayed. This hotel was likely built after the tsunami and has not been updated since. It is completely weatherbeaten all over the beach facing side (the entire hotel) and the pictures are either from when it was first built on when it was photoshopped to oblivion. So much more to say. Firstly, a lax welcome with no explanation of facilities as there are none except for an overpriced beauty salon/massage spa and the restaurants. There is no gym. The towels provided are really dated and have been flogged for use, especially the pool towels. Really thin and gross and non absorbent. The green outdoor lounge chairs and umbrella were covered in grease as well as the floors, see pic. I lay on the chairs and got grease all over my togs and legs. Just gross. One thing that was appaulling was their complete disregard for the environment. There is a sign in the bathroom about caring for the water as it is precious, however this hotel clearly doesn't care about plastic usage, check out the tiny unused plastic bags (pic) they put to serve the cereal. Would a scoop not suffice? On top of that there is an abundance of litter at the beach as soon as you step out. See pic. One of the pieces of litter is a syringe. The beach at dawn is heart breaking. Why is your staff not cleaning this plastic off the beach? It was so awful to see that your hotel is so contradictory with your environmental care factor. It wouldn't take much time. Even if the beach is government owned, this is what your hotel prides itself on, the beach location, what an absolute waste. I could go on with the horrible decor, dilapidated paint and room quality, the lack of air conditioning and obvious cost saving methods, but I think you get the picture. Mentions go to the hardworking porters who are polite, and the beach bar staff especially Rong who was always nice. This hotel needs to be downgraded to a 3 star or have a massive renovation to get to a 4 star. Not worth your dollars. Stay away from this trap. ","July 28, 2018","11    Beyond Resort Karon

Didn’t have the air conditioning on and left the doors open and had a nap. Woke up to Ants attacking my bag. They came and cleaned the room again. Deck chairs by the pool are comfortable when laying on your back, aren’t made to tan your back. Pool was nice enough. Beach is fine for most of the year, however you probably wouldn’t swim in it. All became too hard when I booked my transport through the hotel and informed them I would need to make a stop in Patong to pick something up briefly. I confirmed with them it was fine. The person from Patong called and spoke in native Thai that my taxi to the airport would need to make a stop. Come the time to check out I asked the question if they had told the taxi about the stop in Patong. They said no and it all became to hard. They wanted to tell me it costs more after I confirmed it 5 times with them. Then they just stopped helping me and I had to get my own way to Patong and the airport. They literally just stopped helping me.","July 24, 2018","11    Beyond Resort Karon

673,"Came to Thailand for the second time this year but this time it was for a surprise 60th birthday. The choice of resort was chosen by the family member that organised the surprise getaway. The feeling of not being able to choose the resort i wanted to stay at scared me a little as everyone has different tastes. Upon arriving at the resort we were greeted with a friendly and warm welcome and also were provided with a complimentary drink to freshen up. The staff walked us happily to our room and made us feel very welcome as they showed us where we were staying. The view and access from our balcony was such a shock I wasn’t expecting it to be so close to the pool and I definitely wasn’t expecting the resort to be on the beach! What an absolute bliss of a place it was perfect! The resort is in a great location so close to everything shops, restaurants, and bars. The resort itself was clean and the staff were absolutely amazing! This made our stay so much better knowing that you have such a great group of staff so nurturing and caring. Especially helping us out while people were unwell during the trip. Seeing as the beach was a little dirty it was great to see staff members representing the resort down at the beach trying to do the best they could to clean it. The food and drinks at the resort is reasonably priced and the buffet breakfast had just enough variety. Coming back home from this holiday all I have been doing is recommending this resort to family and friends that would like to visit Phuket. Not once was I disappointed with the service we received the staff members went above and beyond to make sure their guests were happy. I would like to thank every single staff member from beyond Karon resort for an absolutely amazing service during our 8nights here! Thank you so much again for organising and making the birthday dinner such a great oand memorable night your efforts were above and beyond we weren’t expecting that much Thank you again!

676,"We stayed here for a week for a combined birthday/wedding anniversary present to ourselves. When we arrived, we were offered a cool drink before being escorted to our room and it was everything we imagined. We had chosen a room on the ground floor so we could walk right out of our door and into the pool - so glad we did! It was a quiet and relaxing hotel. All the staff were very friendly and helpful. The breakfasts each day were beautiful and fresh, with a variety of hot foods, cereals, yoghurt, fruit, and breads. The eggs and bacon were made fresh to order and you could choose fillings for your omelettes. It was lovely to have breakfast on the balcony overlooking the ocean. The pool bar makes good cocktails, and it's very handy to be able to bill it directly to your room. The resort is in walking distance to many shops and restaurants, and there is a food mart just a few steps away. On my husband's birthday, we arrived back to our room in the afternoon to be greeted by a wonderful birthday cake with plates and forks - this was really appreciated and unexpected!! The massages by the pool were amazing, and only about 50 baht more expensive than one of the local massage places (I would happily pay the extra to hear the ocean while being massaged!!). The only thing that I found unusual (and very minor in the scheme of things), was that while we were checking out, I was asked to return the almost completely used shampoo and conditioner bottles to reception. They weren't anything special, just like the normal ones you are given at hotels for single use. I explained that they were used and almost empty, but I was informed that I definitely needed to return them. Are they reused for other guests? I wouldn't expect this from a 2 star resort, let alone a 4 star resort. This aside, we loved our stay here and would return.","July 8, 2018","11    Beyond Resort Karon

679,"We have travelled to Phuket 5-6 times and always stayed in Patong Beach. We had become tired of the ""full on"" nature of Patong and did not think we would visit/stay there again. However friends wanted to visit Phuket with us and left it to me to book accommodation.Looking for something quieter, out from Patong beach, but close enough to visit by tuk tuk if required.So I found the Beyond resort at Karon Beach and booked it. There are not many resorts that are on the beach at Karon. Beyond is one, in a superb location at the very southern end of Karon beach, a short walk over the hill to Kata Beach and the only noise that can be heard is waves breaking on the beach.There are enough bars and restaurants in close walking proximity to the resort with easy availability to watch your chosen sport either AFL or the Rugby and more.The resort has 2 pools, 1 with a swim up bar. Plenty of sun beds and a massage hut at the southern end. Breakfast was good with a decent selection of food types including omelets, asian dishes, cereals, fruits etc. Not a large breakfast selection but most people should be happy. We were on the top floor, rooms were good with a massive bed. Free coffee capsules (3) were replenished each day. A nice balcony which would benefit from an umbrella as it was quite warm when we visited. While food and drink can be purchased outside cheaper we did drink and eat at the resort and food was very good and enjoyed while sitting by the pool.There are shops including a 7 eleven type store, pharmacy, cash exchange, restaurants, souvenirs directly out front of the resort or within a short walking distance.We did tuk tuk into Patong which cost 400 Baht each way a couple of time, but for me I couldn't wait to get back to Beyond at Karon beach, very relaxing. One of the best things is that it is a no kids resort, no one under 18 can stay there. This made the resort extremely peaceful and relaxing.Beyond Resort rekindled my love for Phuket and I would stay there again in a heartbeat.","June 14, 2018","11    Beyond Resort Karon

You walk out of the reception and you are on the door step of bars, shops, restaurants, taxi ranks and a mini mart right next door. We are sad to be home and would love to return!

Which is a shame because the food is incredible. It certainly did not dampen our holiday at the Beyond Resort though, we loved it! ","May 30, 2018","11    Beyond Resort Karon

We were welcomed and greeted with a drink on our arrival.The rooms are in the style of small studios set around a pool with beautiful greenery all about and the scents in the morning and at night are lovely. The room was beautiful and minimal with plenty of space and thoughtfully laid out. The bathroom was lovely with a pebble floor in the shower and the floor length windows looked out on tropical vegetation. Staff were kind and helpful. We had daily rides to the beach on the hotel truck, they were very flexible about drop off and pick up times. We hired a car, the process was simple and easy.A market takes place on Mondays and Thursdays on the spare ground by the hotel. This was lively and interesting.

Those rooms are very basic (although called suites), noisy AC and terrible water pressure in the shower. The reason we left the hotel was we made a complaint regarding money missing from our room and the Management didn’t appear interested at all, it was obvious they had no intentions of ensuring the matter never happened again even when we advised we would check out ty hotel and find alternative accommodation elsewhere. (So be aware there is no safe and obviously one of the cleaning staff has sticky fingers)As a Manager I found the whole interaction with the hotel management team an absolute joke without remorse for the issue at hand.

It's a small hotel with about 15 rooms all set around a central pool which is a nice set up. At night the fairy lights are turned on which makes the place look really nice. We had breakfast included which is semi outdoors which is nice. The hotel also does excursions and scooter hire. It is located in Rawai which is in the very south of the island so takes about an hour to get to the airport. It is also not a main tourist area so there is not a lot around within walking distance.

701,If you want a quiet hotel in Phuket away from the party side then this is the resort for you. Very nice design of outdoor shower and private pool. Family owned and only 10 rooms which makes this place amazing. Swim at night is amazing. The owners are really friendly. They have a shuttle and they take you to beach and can pick you up. Also give you towels and umbrella!Since this is a hidden gem. The restaurants around this location are all authentic family owned as well where you eat with locals. Great amazing food and at night there is a night market just beside it twice a week and a convenience store. I would recommend this for couples! Great for value too. My only concern was it takes a while for the AC to cool down the room since the outdoor bathroom conducts the heat during the day. But eventually once you close all the doors the room cools down. ,"April 26, 2016","12    Phu NaNa Boutique Hotel

We instantly felt safe and sound. The check in was smooth and he showed us to our room. He set the air-condition for us and left us to enjoy our stay. I asked where to have dinner and recommended the Cashewnut Restaurant which was great and relaxing. After dinner we headed to the pool for a night swim then went to sleep, I being a light sleeper, I could hear the bar down the road starting a Karaoke night at about 2am, which woke me up (not the hotels fault).The breakfast had the basics, no frills. everything was tasty!

It is also a 5min taxi ride to beautiful Nai Hairn beach. Our family rented two rooms by the pool for 10 days over Christmas and New Year. The rooms are beautifully clean and the bathroom is lovely. Linen and towels are replaced each day and drinking water is complimentary. The only downside of the room was that the beds were a little firmer than we are used to, but we forgot about that after a couple of days.The staff at this hotel are five-star quality. The manager, Kech was especially friendly and helpful, and nothing was too much to ask. They organised cars or taxis for us every day and they even booked us a delicious restaurant for Christmas Day and drove us there.The resort owner, Lek and his wife are the most lovely people, and Lek would drive us to places in his personal car and stop on the way to show us interesting things and take photos for us. Only breakfast is available at the resort but this was delicious with choices of bacon/eggs/fruit/toast or traditional Thai dishes.We were on holiday from Australia for a scuba diving holiday and this resort is just near the Chalong Pier which is the main boat pier for scuba day trips and some liveaboards.

714,"This hotel was a severe disappointment considering its 4+ star rating on TripAdvisor.Reasonably clean but a noisy location with lots of street noise. The location is fairly remote but with easy access to Phuket Town via taxi. There are several good restaurants nearby within walking distance.Hotel staff repeatedly ignored the ""Do Not Disturb"" sign to enter my room and turn off the air conditioner without my approval. Neither the receptionist or the owner appeared to show any concern for my complaints. As an avid scuba diver, I had clothing and equipment laid out to dry in the room's air conditioned, dry air, and several times they entered my room and turned off the system leaving clothes and equipment damp and musty.What was more infuriating was the receptionist's and owner's complete indifference to my concern and complaints. Apparently, as a guest, I had no right to leave the air conditioning on. I was sworn at and insulted in front of other guests.They then blamed me for ""breaking"" their key fob - a key fob that had definitely seen many years of use and was already completely worn and abraded. Even though it's not in the guest agreement that you sign at check-in, they will try to 'fine' you 1200 Baht (no receipt issued). What a scam.Breakfast was included but the ""American Breakfast"" was always either cold or stale as though it had been pre-cooked. The coffee was undrinkable. Stick with the tea - you can't go wrong with hot water and a simple tea bag!My advice: avoid this place.","March 5, 2015","12    Phu NaNa Boutique Hotel

They offer a free shuttle service to Nai Harn that leaves twice a day. The hotel is perfect. Clean, comfortable and very modern. The shower is a colourful geometric rainfall oasis, with a sliding door to the ""outside"", and the room comes fully equipped with a fridge, microwave and all the fixings. After a day at the crowded beaches it's best to come back to the hotel and relax by the gorgeous pool which is surrounded by a tropical garden. The staff is always on hand to help with whatever you need, and Mr Lek and his family are wonderful.. They even drove us into town last night! It was like having our parents drop us off! If you like Thai Boxing, there is a great school right next door that offers classes and private lessons. The classes run about $10 per session, and according to my Husband, the trainers are great. The one recommendation I do have, is to hire a scooter for the time you are here, makes it easier to get around, as the walk to where the main drags are, are about 20 minutes in each direction.

Staff are excellent and friendly and nothing is too much trouble, the hospitality shown was above the norm. Close to boxing camps, laundries and market next door Monday and Wednesday.

718,"I chose this place for a dive trip with my daughter because it was (1) best price, with (2) attractive design, (3) close to dive shops, and (4) offered two beds. Hotels in the US$30-$60 range *and* close to dive boats generally did not allow two beds (or added a hefty upgrade). Our room had plenty of space, a kitchenette with microwave and mini bar, good air conditioning and wifi, nice shower, and large towel drying rack. Perfect for us.Dive boats depart from an area of Phuket Town called Chalong. They often pick up from the nearest western beaches of Karon, Kata, and Patong. This hotel is in Rawai, just south of Chalong. Rawai is less popular, with fewer nice restaurants and almost twice as far from the airport than Karon or Kata (45 min rather than 20-25 min). However, it is quiet and offers low cost options.*Don't* choose this place if you want resort style with extensive food and cultural options, or other amenities such as on-site bar, currency exchange, fitness center, spa/massage, or direct access to the beach.*Do* choose this place for friendly, helpful staff; tastefully designed, modern rooms and property; cleanliness; low-key and pocketbook-friendly location; proximity to boat departures; and fantastic value for money.We used the hotel's driver for airport transfers @ 1000 baht arriving / 1200 baht departing (a little extra because our departure was extremely early). That's US$32-$38. We used the hotel's free shuttle to reach the Rawai Beach area. It’s largely a fishing village, with a line of fresh fish/seafood sellers facing restaurants that will cook what you buy. We enjoyed two tasty meals and strolled the trinket shops. It’s low-key; neither upscale nor a party atmosphere. Finally, be aware the hotel doesn’t offer breakfast before 7:30am, but the staff is so ready to please that they made us fresh sandwiches and coffee.The Kata Beach area might be a better compromise with airport access, but could not beat the prices of Rawai, and I would not hesitate to stay at Phu NaNa again.","July 22, 2014","12    Phu NaNa Boutique Hotel

720,"I chose Phu Nana hotel out of the many shortlisted hotels I found on tripadvisor, mainly because I like smallish hotel and it must be clean and also in a quiet area. I wasn't disappointed at all, in fact, I am very impressed with this cute little hotel. Not only it's beautiful in design, have all the amenities needed, the plus point must be their personalised services rendered to their guests. The staff go all out to help and give you attention all the time. Although I initially would like to have a hotel at the beach, PhuNana's location is almost perfect. And the hotel offers free shuttle both Rawai and HaiNarn beach as well as the viewpoint. The deluxe room I book is huge - lovely super-king size bed! As it's low season, I got a nice corner that is not so visible. Room and bathroom are clean and well designed - there is semi- outdoor feel to the bathroom but the basin is too tall!The hotel also helped me to rent a car from the boss and it's delivered to the doorstep making it so convenient. Maybe if I have to nick pick, the only area that I feel can be improved is the breakfast provided. There can be a bit more choices and improvements. I stayed in all four nights and can easily stay longer. It's really value-for-money for the rate. I'm glad to have discovered this gem in the whole Phuket. Will be back!:)","June 24, 2014","12    Phu NaNa Boutique Hotel

The room was huge and super super super clean and the shower was really nice. There was a big spider in the toilet at night but the staff handled it right away.They had free shuttle service to Rawai and Nai Harn beach.

Wondeful, spacious and clean rooms and half the time you have the pool for yourself which is nice. It's a bit out of the way from the main attractions in Phuket, but for me that's a plus.

Very good the shower. Wi-fi connection free and very strong. Breakfast not lavish but good enough. Nice swimming pool in the middle of the complex. Phu Nana is located in a very quiet part of Phuket so consider well what your needs are. This resort is near to Rawai beach. You can either go there by taxi or by scooter. You have restaurants nearby, shops and few massage places (I advise to go to Sue's massage).

The staff was exceptionally helpful in guiding us on where to go, when the shuttle came, and bringing us breakfast on time. Try the fried rice and chicken for breakfast, it's delicious and well portioned! The pool was gorgeous and the rainbath shower was awesome.For food, Bamboo Cafe next door is amazingly delicious and cheap. We especially loved the shakes, the glass noodles, and the spring rolls. There's also free wifi. Rawai beach is a half hour walk away and has lots of restaurants as well. If you're looking for a beach, the hotel has two shuttles a day to Rawai and Naiharn. Rawai is not really for swimming, but Naiharn is gorgeous and not as crowded as Patong. The hotel itself is a bit out of the way, so try getting taxis to travel, rent a motorcycle, or get a company like JC Tours that will pick you up.","November 28, 2013","12    Phu NaNa Boutique Hotel

731,"Phu Na Na is a small boutique hotel located in Rawai Beach around one and a half hours by taxi from Phuket airport. Really, there’s only one way to get there and that is by taxi. The taxi companies usually have a set prices to most destinations but they are still quite variable so it’s a good idea to get a couple of quotes before agreeing on a price. The fare should be no more than 800 baht. Make sure that you choose a good quality car with airconditioning.The staff at Phu Na Na are friendly and helpful. On check in you will be asked to fill out a breakfast menu and nominate a time that you would like it. It’s a simple american breakfast with eggs & sausages or traditional Thai. The breakfast is served on time whether or not you are there so make sure that you are on time. We nominated 8am breakfast and when we arrived at 8.10, our eggs were cold. The rooms are very clean, spacious and comfortable with impressive bathrooms. The rooms are serviced daily. The pool is a good size for a small hotel and kept in pristine condition. We had a two bedroom family room with queen size beds and two bathrooms. Many of the hotels do not cater for older children requiring twin beds, you will need to check if it is possible before you make a booking. Personally, we found the beds a little on the firm side and somewhat difficult to get used to. There is a good stock of drinks in the fridge and the free water provided. Surprisingly, Evian water is classed as mineral water so we were charged at the end of our stay. One of the down sides to being at Rawai Beach is the location. There isn’t a lot of public transport so you will have to rely on taxis to get around which in Phuket, can be costly. Lek, the owner of the hotel, kindly offered to take us to the local jetty where the seafood markets are held and took us to a couple of local places of interest in the area. The next day we caught a taxi into old Phuket city where we managed to find a tuk tuk driver who showed us around for 100 baht. The next day we hired a tuk tuk for the day for 1200 baht. Make sure that you discourage the drivers from taking you to places that you don’t want to go such as the gem factory as they are compensated if they bring tourists.What I would do- The night markets in old Phuket city are wonderful. They open on Saturday and Sunday and commence at 4pm. Get there early and try a fantastic array of traditional Thai food at market prices, visit the big buddha on the hill side, it’s beautiful, Go to the Thai boxing training centre near to Phu Na Na Hotel as you are able to train or watch them train. Go to Rawai Beach Seafood Market at the jetty. You are able to purchase freshly caught seafood off the boats and have it cooked at one of the local market restaurants. What I wouldn't do...The biggest mistake of our trip to Phuket was visiting the zoo. The animals look so distressed and it was very upsetting to see. The elephants are chained up by their feet so they can’t move around and some of the big cats were even caged in 4 metre x 4 metre cages. Tourists are able to get up close and personal with some of the more unfortunate animals and have their photos taken. The monkey show is hideous. Monkeys are trained to lift weights, hold signs and reluctantly, act like humans. We walked out of this show a few minutes in.","July 17, 2013","12    Phu NaNa Boutique Hotel

732,"We stayed at this hotel for 2 nights in May 2013.The hotel was beautifully presented, with rooms surrounding a lap pool. We were particularly impressed with the interior design work in the bathroom. There were pebbles leading into the shower area and a glassed off area which had tropical plants and an abundance of natural light. It was definitely the most unique bathroom we have seen in our travels.The rooms have wi fi access and a large flat screen tv with satellite channels. The power sockets allow for international electrical appliances and the rooms also have umbrellas and clothes drying racks which came in very handy for us. The hotel is only a few years old, so everything seems very new and fresh. As with most hotels in the area there was also a bar fridge, a kettle and two free bottles of water daily. We found the bed to be very comfortable.The staff do not speak much English (google translate can bridge that gap), but they were friendly and very helpful. When I accidentally inserted my SD card into the wrong slot in the computer, they spent half an hour fishing it out. We were so grateful that they persisted until they retrieved it for us.This hotel is a little bit hard to find as it is in a side street away from the main part of Rawai. Our tuk tuk driver had a bit of trouble finding it. It is probably a bit too far to walk to the main area of Rawai from the hotel. We ended up renting a scooter from the hotel, which was a great way to explore the surrounding area. There are local buses which stop on the main road near the hotel (2 minutes walk away) and will take you to Phuket Town quite cheaply. The breakfasts were generous and very tasty. There was fruit, juice, eggs, ham, sauces and bread. We noticed that the lunch and dinner menu had a nice selection of options at very reasonable prices, but we did not get a chance to dine there during our stay.While in Rawai we recommend going to the seafood markets and having dinner there. We had a beautiful meal overlooking the ocean, which was one of the highlights of our trip.The only negative comment we can think of in regards to this hotel is that there is a bit of traffic noise. The road it's on is not a main road, but there is still a bit of traffic. However this was quite a small issue. You could mainly hear it when in the bathroom and a little bit when in the swimming pool area. It did not affect our sleep as closing the door to the bathroom shut most of the noise out. We were in a room on the side of the hotel closest to the road - it might be a bit better on the other side of the pool.This is a small hotel, so don't expect any lagoon pools, but the attention to detail that they put into the rooms was fantastic.Overall, we found this to be a beautiful little hotel. We liked that it was away from the hussle and bussle of Patong. It was a great little find and we highly recommend it for anyone looking for a peaceful little retreat.","June 28, 2013","12    Phu NaNa Boutique Hotel

734,"A nice hotel - modern, well constructed and well appointed. Very friendly and helpful staff. Breakfast is limited but what they offer is good quality, although the 'American breakfast' was exactly the same each day (x 3). On the map the hotel looks like it is 'tucked away' but is situated on a side road that is heavily used by local access traffic. I found the room we were allocated on the side of the hotel next to the road too noisy for my taste, but I crave peace and quiet in a hotel room. After our initial afternoon siesta, which yielded no actual sleep because of the road noise, I asked to switch to a quieter room and the staff were very accommodating in moving us straight away. This room was much better but still the odd noisy motorbike could be heard. The pool is very nice for a dip and short laps. Disappointed that when I wanted to pay by Visa for some extras put on the room that a 3% surcharge was going to be added to use the card. Simple, straightforward accommodation - it fits the bill as a boutique hotel in south Phuket.","June 10, 2013","12    Phu NaNa Boutique Hotel

735,"We spend two nights in a standard room for which we paid 1620 Baht pN. The hotel is quite small with no more than ten rooms, or so, that are all located around a long pool. The rooms are beautifully appointed with a small kitchenette (microwave, kettle, fridge) and look and feel quite elegant and designed. The Bathroom opens to a small, walled-in patio, with lush tropical greenery. Nice. The pool is fantastic to swim in and cool off.The location is OK, but you will need a scooter to get around. Or you can take the pick-up buses, but that usually means quite some time waiting. The pick-up buses go all the way to Nai-Harn beach which is arguably the best beach on Phuket.There are no good restaurants in walking distance (or at least we haven't found one) and the Bamboo place right next door sucks. But even though they do not have a kitchen they do a fantastic and cheap room service, that gets delivered in no time from some other place. The breakfast needs to be ordered ahead on a little card with the time you'd like the breakfast on it, meaning you'll have to plan ahead. Quick tipp: Be about a qurter of an hour earlier than the time you but on the card. This way you make sure that the breakfast is freshly cooked. The Asian brekfast is especially nice.The biggest plus of the place is the staff that are always there and willing to help and make your stay perfect. For example: when we checked in I saw one of these towel-elephants (the thing they do with folding the towels) in one of the rooms we passed and I immediately said that I wanted one of those. Unfortunately our room had a different arrangment of towels. But the next day when we came back from the beach: a towelephant in our room.

We arrived a day late from flight cancellations so we weren't in the best moods.We had booked a double room but when we arrived it was so small, on talking to Nadia at the front desk to upgraded us complimentary to a family room pool view. We were so grateful. Every single day staff went out of their ways to make our time there that much better.Peach runs the adventure kids club. My 3 year old just loved him! Every morning at breakfast he visited us and wished us a great day and made sure my daughter had everything she needed to be happy.. face painting, movies, games. He was just unbelievably nice and caring. We just think the world of him!My 6 month old had just started eating solids so each morning at breakfast they would make sure watermelon was available for us and bought it to our table. My 3 year old needed a trip to emergency during our stay at 4am for gastro. They arranged transport for us at a moments notice.On our return our daughters 2 favourite hotel staff (& ours) Nadia and Peach delived a get well soon fruit plate with a get well soon message to our room. It was an amazing gesture that bought me to tears. It made Paige feel 100 times better! Never have we had such amazing care on a trip and we would have no hesitation in recommending this accomodation.The Saturday night glow party was a HUGE hit! Really great night!The facilities are clean, safe and well maintained.The location is opposite a beach (5 min walk).

The only downside is the mozzies but who are we to complain as it is an island afterall.,"May 27, 2019","13    Novotel Phuket Surin Beach Resort

The other staff member that I would like to thank is Zaidy at the front desk, we didn't need to leave the resort until 6pm for our flight the girls at the desk the day before would allow a late checkout but wanted 1500baht, we were going to have to use the pool side shower and get changed in the toilets, when we were checking out he offered a shower room I have no idea why the girls before couldn't offer that.","May 18, 2019","13    Novotel Phuket Surin Beach Resort

747,"Just got back from a memorable holiday from Phuket. We stayed at this resort for 3 nights. We checked in on the day of my daughter's birthday, as I had earlier requested for a surprise while checking in, they highly obliged with the same and yes my daughter really loved her surprise in the room. Basically I was looking out for a kid friendly resort and they are one of them which caters to all parents with kids.The staff is super friendly and the resort is very clean. It's just five minutes from Surin Beach which is less crowded unlike the other beaches of Phuket.The good thing about this place is the kids will never get bored there is so much for them to do, be it the kids world, kids club desk, the movie theatre, the gaming arcade, the in house ice cream parlour, the toy shop(which you'll have to pay for) and swimming pools with 2 slides. The resort not only caters to the kids but also to their parents, every evening they have some entertaining games happening be it Bingo or Majority Wins and there are many prizes to be won too.The only thing which I would like to recommend is to have a little variety in the breakfast menu, found that to be more monotonous and repetitive. Otherwise no complaints.Thank you Novotel Phuket Surin Beach Resort for a memorable stay.","May 10, 2019","13    Novotel Phuket Surin Beach Resort

751,"I would have to say this is one of the best places I have stayed with kids. The only downside is the location with not a lot of cheap market shopping options or restaurants outside we felt comfortable eating at. However it’s not far to Patong and other beaches, just a shame the taxis are expensive.Its opposite beach and found while the beach looked beautiful it was littered with washed up rubbish. we visited in the morning so maybe in the afternoon it might have been cleaned up??The resort is great with an amazing pool. We got a pool terrace room which was great. Maybe the room/bathroom a little small but it was fine for our 2 night stay. Plus they have suites if you need a bigger room. Bed was hard but I called reception and they promptly added a pillow top on at 11pm when I couldn’t get comfortable. Was comfortable after that.We found the breakfast to be nice and varied, love the kids options. The best bit is for the kids. Movie room, pool, kids club room, kids activities non stop throughout day. So much fun!Highly recommend paying extra for the vip kids. We got it and all meals and drinks for our son included for the day plus activities. Did the pizza making and cup cake decorating so much fun! Loved the foam party and water aerobics. Gym is good too. We found the meals to be delicious.Would I stay here again, absolutely!!","May 5, 2019","13    Novotel Phuket Surin Beach Resort

753,"I'm really not one to complain, but this hotel I would look to avoid. Warning signs were raised when the queue to check-in was long due to amount of people complaining about there rooms. We booked a room for 2 x adults and a 10 year old child, the hotel insisted on charging 1,000 baht a night for an extra bed. So they expect a 10 year old to sleep in a small double bed with their parents. The water slides left my ankles bruised, the loose wiring to the speakers near the pool were worrying, but then I jumped out the pool when I saw the Satellite maintenance man doing some wiring while standing on metal ladders which were 'IN' the swimming pool. I know Thailand is a bit crazy, but that was just WOW!

754,"Great hotel but it was very hot. It was uncomfortable to enjoy your meal as it was so hot in the restaurant areas. Breakfast was pretty average. The buffet dinners were quite good. The kids loved the pool, the movie room and activities like the foam party.Towels were always scarce. We got two towels in our room for a family of four. I’d ask for four and was shocked to find they’d left none. Pool towels would always run out as well.One lady in the kids club never had any idea about what to do. She was trying to ask for money off me when I’d bought the kids package for the day. She dragged me to the front desk to check but I was correct all along. Very dodgy customer service.

755,We booked the Sunday brunch (they have themed buffets) ... it was terrible!!! The food was like left over from breakfast except for the japanese spread and a few hot meals. There are not much choices and definitely NOT worth it. There was a foam party where the kids enjoy but definitely not worth paying for brunch. Better off getting ala carte for the money spent.

756,"We arrived to Novotel Surin on the 12th of April at 6am. My husband booked an early check in for one room (for a fee) in order to get at least one room for us to sleep. Check in was fast and they were nice enough to give us both rooms at 6am at the same price.The rooms were clean, modern and nice, I was surprised with the way they have set up the entire hotel in order to make it kid friendly. The wow cow ice cream shop had delicious ice creams, they had an arcade area, the cinema was very nice and comfy always showing very good movies. There was also a play area were my daughter learn how to do shapes with balloons, arts and craft and also had the staff there to play different board games. We also enjoy family nights playing bingo and other games for different prizes.The swimming pool is very nice and we spent all the time there, the color of the water wasn’t so clear but we assumed that was the normal color after the foam party and also the color in general being a hotel so close to the beach. (no one got sick and we were in it 24/7)The slides were well supervised and organized so we all had a blast in it. My daughter hit her elbow and quickly the lifeguard came to put a plaster on it, they really look after all the kids that were playing in the pool.Another thing to notice and say thank you, is that when the foam party started the lifeguard was there, making sure that all the kids were fine. Sometimes its hard to see with all that foam around and some kids were unsupervised, so they were there looking carefully each one of themThe breakfast was nice, with a different selection of international foods; my only criticism was the juice was a little bit watery maybe because they used to pour it on top the ice. Also was very difficult sometimes to find a table, cutlery or even get a service. The kids used to get free popsicles every day and it was very nice as it was very hot but they just loved it, just to grab the phone and order one, it was fun for themThe staff in the hotel were VERY FRIENDLY, never saw a bad face, an attitude or anything like it. You can tell that the hotel was understaffed but the ones that were there working, every day gave us a smile, a good service and were very accommodating to our needs and requests. From the Bar manager that now i cant remember his name to K. Pap from the candy shop who had the patience of the year dealing with my daughter asking the price of every single toy and candy in the shop. They are an example of a person who #1, loves his job and 2 is and what customer service is all about.The food in the hotel was very nice; I recommend the family pizza and the Mexican buffet very delicious at very affordable prices.The hotel is open, so in the hot time of day was very difficult to be in the restaurant area on in the terrace, I would recommend to the management of the hotel, to put UV block roof at least in the beautiful al fresco terrace and extra fans, even the ones that have mist... that only would have brought the temperature a few degrees lower during the day, otherwise, no one can sit in that area only after 3pm.This is not a hotel for couples, I wouldn’t recommend it for them but I do believe that its one of the best hotels in Phuket for families and kids. I would definitely go back if Im ever in Phuket with my family.Keep up with the good work! Hope to see you soon!","April 18, 2019","13    Novotel Phuket Surin Beach Resort

Thank you very much to the Siam Adventure Club team.Only downside is that apart from a few locals who trade along the beach strip - nearby restaurants, tour agents and market places are heavily overpriced and choked for choice.

763,"Not our first time here. We loved this resort very much that we make repeat visits and on our latest stay here, they have already launched their super awesome SIAM Adventure Club. With endless complementary activities lined-up for the entire family by the brand new Siam Adventure Club, we spent most of our time chilling in the resort, stepping out just to head to the lovely Surin beach with crystal clear water. Our boys' favourite activity is Pool Boxing where they can have friendly match with other kids at the resort. They also get to have a playful match with their father.The pool slide lit up in colourful glow come night time.There's something for kids of every age from the Kids World to Teens Hangout Area. We can leave our kids at the Kids World under the supervision of the staffs while we pamper ourselves at their spa. The resort’s brand new state-of-the-art cinema room is also one of the main attraction. We get to catch some of the latest movie in the comfort of a real cinema room here. The rooms here are completely refurbished by September 2018 so when we got here in November, it was all nice and feels brand new. Truly a family resort, kids are treated like a VIP here with our suite decorated to a cheerful children theme and the boys were given their own fun toiletries set. Not to be missed is their ultra fun complementary Pool Foam Party held twice weekly and also the FREE popsicles from their Popsicle Hotline. The kids went crazy over it. Overall, the new SIAM Adventure Club brings this resort a notch higher and I can easily say that it is one of the best family resort in Phuket for us.","March 6, 2019","13    Novotel Phuket Surin Beach Resort

764,"The Novotel Surin beach Phuket is all about the children. Children will enjoy the slides and the entertainment. The kids club is a little tired but the staff are wonderful. I could not fault the staff at all. I stayed 6 nights with my 7 and 2 year old. It was too long for me, 3 nights would have been perfect. I love the hotels access to Surin beach, this is a little gem, especially in the early morning when the colours are at their best. You can be on the beach in a couple of minutes from the hotel, bliss!Breakfast is varied, I thought the food was pretty good overall.The room we stayed in was also a little tired but it was clean and we were only there to sleep so this didn’t bother me.The pool is a hive of activity during the day, the same songs are played over and over and there are children everywhere! Something to consider if travelling without kids! The toilet by the pool was often really dirty, this was my one pet hate, one toilet for lots of people! Also the sun beds are all reserved early in the morning by people putting their towels down, I only realised I had to do the same after three days of nowhere to sit! It’s a bit annoying really, I thought we’d all stopped doing this in the 1980’s! Obviously not! To conclude, the hotel (aside from the pool toilet) was always clean, the staff are lovely. The price is reasonable and the access to the beach is great. The kids had a lot of fun and really that was what it was all about! Myself, I preferred Twin Palms next door, but that wouldn’t have been half as much fun for the kids!","March 4, 2019","13    Novotel Phuket Surin Beach Resort

767," This resort is definitely recommended for families. It is very kid friendly with lots of activities for kids and adults. (If I was single or a couple without kids, this would not be my preferred hotel.)We traveled with a 7 year old and an 18 month. This hotel has 'The Siam Adventurer Club' which organises lots of activities for kids. There is also a kids club, movie theatre, face painting, pools, an area in the main lobby with activities as well as an area in the main lobby for face painting, drawing and TV. Note: there was also a pool for little kids which was perfect for my 18 month child. For adults there is a gym, spa, various fitness activities, bar with sports TV, pools, etc. Because of the various activities available for my 7 year old, despite looking after our 18 month, we feel well rested and relaxed. The various activities certainly entertained my eldest, who only emerged when he was hungry. The beach is across the road and there are Family Marts, 7-11's, restaurants, etc around the resort. There is a hotel being built behind the Novotel however even though our back door room opened to the building works, we didn't hear any noise when the door was closed.If I had any gripes, it would be our first day there where the Western staff weren't very friendly (particularly in food in beverage) however all the local/Asian staff were lovely. After the first day, we saw smiles start to emerge from the Western staff. This resort is well recommended if you have kids and want to rest and relax. We stayed for a week and really enjoyed our stay. A special thanks to the below people for making our stay amazing:Bong in The Siam Adventurer Club. Such a lovely, smiley, happy person. He works hard and does everything he can to help staff. The kids & parents loved him.Mim at the front desk was extremely helpful. We forgot to collect our pram from the airport carousal and went straight to the resort with our bags. When we realied, the first person we spoke to only checked with lost and found at the airport and said it was lost. Mim took over and did thorough investigation and within a few hours the pram was found and returned to us. This wasn't our only dealing with her; every time we dealt with her she was very friendly and helped a lot.Kham who works serving around the pool was always had a friendly smile and was very helpful. Life savers/first aid staff for keeping everyone safe. It’s not easy standing in that burning sun all day. Adventure club staff who were wonderful at keeping the kids entertained.

769,"After reading so many different reviews from different people in different situations, I thought I’d give my honest opinion after staying at this hotel for two weeks with my wife and two kids aged 7&4.We have been to Thailand 15+ times and stayed in the Shangri- la Bangkok,dusit Thani bangtao right down to beach huts so we have done it all and are relatively easily pleased.The hotel is ideal for families with young children,from babies right up to early teens.I personally would not dream of staying here without children but that’s not a negative for the hotel it’s simply a kids hotel.We had a pool access room which was great.The beds are small and in my opinion only ok for one adult and one 5/6 year old max per bed.You could not share the bed with your partner and the two kids in the other bed.It is a physical impossibility for the adults at least.The kids club door doesn’t lock so the signing in process is really pointless as they can just walk out,there was an electric door lock fitted but it wasn’t working which was bizarre.Peach, the kids entertainment manager is a real asset and such a lovely guy to the kids and adults alike.Paul the assistant manager was also very helpful and friendly and was great having a European to deal with any problems you may have without any language barriers.All the staff at the hotel are really nice and friendly which was great.The breakfast was ok-good which we had read otherwise but basically it’s like a cattle market after 830 am and there are not enough tables for the amount of guests that is simply the problem.The pastries aren’t exactly Parisian standards but what do you want for £90-£100 a night for 4 !!If I was in the banyan tree I’d of thrown them at the chef but we weren’t so it’s relevant.The tables could do with a bit more of a rigorous clean between dinners at breakfast as that was the only time we ate here.Right, the food and drink prices got up my nose they just don’t represent the quality of food being served and very few people were seen eating or drinking around the hotel as a whole which was a shame as the atmosphere would be great if that was the case.The twin palms hotel next door was only slightly higher in price for similar dishes but 3 times the quality.Pizzas are great and from a wood fire oven but the food standards are just average using cheap ingredients and that includes the cocktails but charging a premium price.Please don’t let this reflect on the chefs they were great and the kitchen spotless but can only cook with what the company provides.The hotel prices over all I’d say are 25% at least more than they should be.The sweet shop and ice cream shop are simply eye wateringly high in price hence no one is ever buying them.We opted for the kids food and drink package which is probably pointless as you’ll get them their lunch but end up eating out of of a night so we didn’t get the full use.If you one to not move for the whole time then it’s for you but it wasn’t for us.The stair way on the way to the slides just doesn’t get jet washed and basically stinks of children’s wee to be blunt,I told the manger and it was cleaned but then after a day the smell was back so it’s obviously not on the jet wash list daily and it should be.The slides by the way were brilliant,small but really fast and the kids loved them.It was our first experience of a family sort of hotel in Thailand with slides and kids clubs etc so compared to a similar style hotel in Spain for example it was far superior.We would stay again without hesitation as quite simply there isn’t any competition in this market in and around surin & bangtao which is the nicest part of the island and the price was really good for the room except the beds if that makes sense.To sum up taking the price point into consideration.Great for young children which equals happy parents !!It’s not the Ritz but certainly isn’t the Pitz.Prices need addressing quickly and some more attention to detail but over all a nice stay.Thank you Novotel surin.","January 30, 2019","13    Novotel Phuket Surin Beach Resort

770,"We spent 8 nights in this hotel with our two kids, 5 and 6 year old. Kids enjoyed the most as there were a lot of activities organized for them, such the face painting every morning, foam pool party, playing bingo in the evenings, great cinema showing new movies, two swimming pool slides, free ice creams in the play house and so many other activities. I want to mention the welcome presents and the farewell little presents for them that was very nice. The beach is very close to the hotel and the hotel has a very nice swimming pool area that we all enjoyed. The only thing that bothered us at the end was that the hotel was not very flexible with the check out time which is 12:00 at noon. We had a late evening flight and we asked at the reception if we can keep our room for two more hours until 14:00 as we are with little children. We offered to pay for this. They said that is a high season and they can not do anything. After long discussion we got two hours so we coud stay until 14:00 and the rest of the day we had to spend at the hotel lobby and at the airport which was quite tiring specially that we had to travel for 12 hours to get home. Maybe in the future the hotel can do something about this.","January 21, 2019","13    Novotel Phuket Surin Beach Resort

Very full children’s entertainment programme and themed menu evenings. Room was very comfortably and thankfully quiet from the pool music and activities.

773,"We travelled as a family of 4, 2 adults and children age 14 & 11. Check in was swift although we were not given the welcome drink as stated and id seen other people receive, our bags were swiftly taken to our room. Our room had 2 double bed and was adequate although I will say the beds were extremely hard but surprisingly this did not affect my sleep.We had breakfast included which I found to be good quality on the whole for a buffet breakfast apart from the juices which I thought were revolting. There was lots of choice!The pool area was fantastic although when the hotel got busy the week before Christmas there was a problem with people getting up and reserving beds and also they ran out of towels at one point. You could order food and drink from your sun lounger but the prices are extremely high. A Chang beer was 3 times more expensive than the little shop at the front of the hotel and you could buy 7 cans of Coca Cola from the shop down the road for the price of 1 from the bar, for the exact same can. My advice would be to take a small cool bag with you. This hotel is great for kids and people who complain about it surely tustve read the reviews before going as there were lots of children when we went but it didn't bother us, although a lot of foreign people let their children run riot, one was running off with the pool table balls as we were playing (free pool table btw) parents not interested another Chinese boy was sat in pool squirting anybody and everybody whilst they were on their sun loungers and his dad thought it was funny.The cinema was fantastic also kids club although my children never used this we had a look and they have a games area with mariokart etc.We hired a car for 4 days then a scooter from KP down the street which I would recommend.We extended our stay 4 times and ended up staying for 17 nights and we managed to keep the same room each time, on our last day we were allowed a late check out at 2pm if we wanted till 4 it would've cost us 95gbp. We booked the shower room which ended up being a ground floor hotel room, and had flowers on the bed and a bowl of fruit and a welcome note (we never got this treatment) also it had 2 chairs in room which we never had in room 1511, we could only sit on bed.I would not hesitate to return to this hotel the value for money is excellent the only thing I would suggest is for them to bring their restaurant prices down, I mean breakfast was soooo busy the lunch and dinner there was hardly anyone every using it as the prices are extortionate!","January 7, 2019","13    Novotel Phuket Surin Beach Resort

If you have kids, there are daily activity schedules that are available for them to be occupied while you get your spa on.Theres a water slide, pool, and lazy pool area with plenty of places to lay out. They offer bar and 99 baht pizza slice. But you're better off buying a whole pizza for 200 baht. Pizza is okay, thin crust style.Out of all the hotels I've been to, this had the most longest check-in. Be very patient if theres a line ahead of you. Not sure what takes so long. They do charge a deposit fee as well.The people here greet you all the time. They also have taxi service with posted prices. Make sure to book taxis ahead of time for early departures. If you want to haggle, there are taxi services right outside. They have free shuttle services too, but you have to book 24 hr ahead of time. This place was pretty busy and booked.

777,"Ok, so the big draw for us was the pool for our 8 year old son. He loved it! We loved the hotel the moment we arrived and its location to Surin Beach - which is just beautiful - was ideal. We had a family king suite, which was very spacious, nice comfortable beds, balcony etc. Usb charging points so no worries about needing an adaptor etc. The room was booked for 3 people, but they only ever gave us toiletries and towels for 2 people?? The pools were really lovely and the general lobby areas very nice too. The kids club ane cinema our son loved and the free pool table was a great addition too. There was service around the pool by pressing a button which sent a waiter/ress over to your table/lounger. One guy who worked there was so nice, always helpful and smiling. On the other hand another lady who often looked as if you were asking for her last baht! Breakfast was absolutely lovely by thai standards, with lots or choice and always hot. Food and drink generally to purchase was very expensive. There was a German chef who looked to have everyone doing their jobs efficiently and when we ordered food it was very nice. However, the advertised 'Thai Night' was beyond pathetic and funnily enough, i didnt see the head chef around that night. How a good standard of hotel chain could get a themed night in their host country so bad is beyond me! Admittedly it wasnt very busy, but that isnt the point. The food should have been of a very good standard regardless of whether they had 5 or 50 customers.

779,"The hotel is definitely targeted at families. As an Accor member we chose this hotel as we have a 2 yr old daughter and liked the look of the swimming pool and slide.Our stay has not been the best due to;- - how most the staff minus a few look like they hate their job, offer poor service and avoid you if you make eye contact- the beds in our room were really hard and we didnt slept well - the rooms are small and we are unsure how large families would stay comfortably. We had a family suite. The bunk bed is in the loungeroom. There was no separate space to sit as a family to watch a movie because the lounge is converted into bunk beds. Also the family suite is not decorated like the photos on the internet. There are no beanbags or toys or kids doona on the bed. - house cleaning either forgot to give us towels or would only give us 2 towels (when we had booked a family suite and there were 3 of us)- our daughter still naps and all the noise from the pool area (screaming kids) made it difficult to sleep during the day or go to bed at night. Having a room facing the waterslide was not ideal for us.- our first experience of kids club is that parents drop their kids off and the children were allowed to be wild in the amazing play area. No supervision. We took our daughter to play with toys and stayed during the visit. We watched kids be wild with no adult supervision or any rules in place to keep them safe. As a parent this made me concerned to ever use a kids club.- buffet breakfast was like attending feeding time at the zoo. There are only a couple of high chairs which is surpsising for a family resort- we found it easier to go to the sports club buy drinks and then bring them to dinner because no staff came to take drink orders at the main restaurant. - not enough staff on to service the hotel. Only 2 staff on at the pool bar which services all the pool side chair guests, swim up bar and the Joe's restraunt at the pool. We would push the button to order drinks and no one would come. When we went to the counter there were only ever 2 staff run off their feet not knowing what to do first. - there is no air conditioning in the front reception/foyer/dining areas. We visited in December when it is cooler and in the afternoon it was very stuffy/hot. It must be unbearable during the hot season.What we liked- the food was the best part of our stay!! Every night there were different themed buffets. The food was our favourite part of our stay.- The chefs were always happy, engaging and loved to chat.- black out curtains in the room- the waterslide is fun (if you can manage to get one of the 10 mats available)- Peach who runs the kids outdoor activities is such a nice guy! He was welcoming and encouraging for us to participate. After 3 awful days at the hotel, he was the first staff member who was kind and engaged us. We loved joining activities if he was running them.- The beach across the road is fabulous to swim or visit the beach markets (excellent cheap massages and yummy food)- great laundry service 2 doors up from the hotel (cheaper than hotel)- there is a cinema (we never used but looked great)- the icecream parlour and happy staff were a favourite for us! The staff here were very kind.- each day there is a mascot parade, our daughter loved hugging the cow or other furry friends- umbrellas to borrow at concierge Overall our stay has been nice, we have enjoyed the food at the resort, the easy access to Surin Beach and how bright and colorful the hotel is with lots of kid friendly activities. We wont be returning as there are more places to explore in Thailand for us (and I couldnt cope with listening to my husband complain about how hard the bed is again!). This hotel is suited to families with older kids who are allowed to entertain themselves on the water slide, kids club and cinema. ","December 18, 2018","13    Novotel Phuket Surin Beach Resort

781,"*Delayed Review: I picked the Novotel @ Surin Beach, as we wanted somewhere away from the hustle & bustle....we got that. The resort is lovey, the staff are even lovelier....the room was a good size and right next to the pool. We obviously stayed in a quiet time, which was both good & bad......good as the the service was personal & quick, we didn't have to fight for space around the pool, or line up for breakfast.....but was also (slightly) bad, as the resort just lacked a bit of atmosphere; when it was so empty. We stayed when they were obviously doing up/renovating 3/4 of the resort & they only had one side open/booked. We stayed here with 2 teenage girls, who obviously love just chillin & relaxing with screen time by the pool, but would of also loved some other activities to do aswell?! All in all the resort is great, the food was always good, (cocktails even better)...& we actually had one of the hottest salads on our trip @ the bar - which was delicious! NB - We did eat outside most of our stay....as it was half the price of the resort. We would recommend 'Audy Restaurant' just down the road, every day of the week....& they pick up up in their lil' tuk tuk ute.","November 30, 2018","13    Novotel Phuket Surin Beach Resort

The dinner was served outdoor under star lights surround by water. It would be a good treat for couples or just the parents.

Management came through and explained all rooms on ground floor have poor drainage which is why there is bad smell. We requested to change rooms to be advised that they will try and fix the issue before changing rooms.

797,"Although a lovely setting and great water slides we were not impressed. It must be highly promoted in Europe as almost all of the people staying there were from there. The breakfast was appalling, worst breakfast in all the places over the years staying in Phuket, stale cereal and no variety. The location for us was terrible. Boring, nothing great within walking distance.","April 30, 2019","14    Phuket Orchid Resort & Spa

798,"We stayed 9 nights at Phuket Orchid. This is our 4th visit to Thailand, we have always raved about how friendly & hospitable thai staff are in resorts.... and then we came to Orchid. We feel Orchid need a staff training day purely dedicated to customer service. Many staff here need to show more enthusiasm . The barman at the pool has no energy or smiles. If you are a barman at a pool you should be upbeat and full of personality. At least ask customers what country they are from. Engage with your clientele. Same goes to barman where you get welcome drinks, coffee etc. The girl running the gym seemed moody, one day she'd force a smile the next day she wouldn't. I even sarcastically said one morning ""you always look so happy to see me"". Then on the morning it was a male gym staff, I said to him ""thanks goodbye"" when leaving & he didnt even look up from his phone to acknowledge me.The only really friendly staff we encountered was the massage ladies, the babysitter Mook & the lovely cleaning lady Kwan. Kwan is bubbly, friendly & always has a smile. She should get promoted from cleaning to a higher position because she understands customer service. As for Ta the massage lady if this review was based on her alone it would be an easy 5 stars. She has magic healing hands and I can honestly say she gives the best massages I have ever received in my life. She was like a doctor of massage, not only fixing all my trouble spots but also putting me in a state of total relaxation. Now I'm sure there are a lot more friendly staff that we didnt meet but unfortunately this review is on what we experienced & there are just too many staff who need to lift their customer service game. 13 years as a Police officer I know how to communicate effectively & understand that professionalism is key. Second complaint is the buffet breakfast. Once again every resort we have been to including 3 star resorts have had breakfast full of flavor and variety.This buffet had no bacon, mushrooms or baked beans.Only 2 choices of fresh fruit. No croissants, muffins etc. The waffles & pancakes were cold, bland & inedible to us. My husband asked the waffle lady for the fresh one she had just made as he did not like cold waffles that he saw flies land on. She declined and grouched at him ""no, same same""So staff & breakfast buffet. If they can turn this around they will find they will start getting much better reviews. Please take my criticism in a positive note for feed forward going ahead. Now to finish with the positives. The pools are fabulous, the cleaning lady Kwan bubbly and welcoming, massage ladies also friendly & perfect massages from Ta. ","April 24, 2019","14    Phuket Orchid Resort & Spa

812,"AVOID this resort. I don't even know where to begin on how disappointed I was with this resort.  For the price I paid I feel the resort has totally ripped me off. We stayed at the resort for 4 nights and left today.Our six year old son fell on the slippery floor in our room and hit his head on the bed base.  As per the photo attached the card in the room states a doctor is on call.  As my Son's head was bleeding and he was very distressed I walked to reception to have the doctor come to our room. I obviously expected a charge for the service but didn't think it would be a problem.  I have stayed at many resorts worldwide and have had to use the services of the hotel doctor, there has never been an issue.  When I made the request the reception lady looked at me blankly, I wasn't surprised as none of the Thai local staff had a good command of the english language.  So I further explained the situation, she stated there was no doctor and all clinics were closed due to it being Sunday.  She gave me some cotton wool and bandaids and said they only had a first aid kit.  I asked where the nearest hospital was and she was unsure. As you can imagine I was very distressed myself as my Son heavily hit his head.  Without the help of the staff who appeared not interested in helping me at all I returned to our room.  My Husband and I used the internet to find the nearest clinic and drove there ourselves.  My Son had 5 stitches in his forehead.  For a resort that promotes themselves as a family resort I would have expected at least alittle more assistance than what was provided.  The bathrooms were dated and not the standard I would expect for what I paid. Breakfast was just terrible.  The juices were cheap fake fruit juice totally undrinkable.  The salads items were warm and the bacon/pancakes/donuts were cold.  The worst thing about breakfast was the staff, they were sweating and all looked like they had some better place to be. The pool staff were just rude.  One time my Son had some sand on him.  The lifeguard started poking him and yelling at him loudly in Thai.  My Son is 6 and doesn't speak Thai. He had no idea what the man was saying so he just starting crying. Great happy holiday memory.At checkout I was going to let the staff know of my disappointment but I just could not be bothered.  Not once at check out did they say ""did you have a nice stay"" "" please come again"" she just shoved the bill in my face and wanted the money.  The only positive of this resort was the kids club workers tried to engage my children in the activities.  At the time they were the only English speaking kids. The management will reply to this review with an empty apology and no compensation. At the end of the day I'm the sucker that got scammed out of alot of money for crap hotel.  I hope I saved someone because I've written this review.","January 22, 2019","14    Phuket Orchid Resort & Spa

August is usually rainy season but we were blessed with great weather so made good use of the amenities at the hotel- the pool at this resort is outstanding!! (especially for children- slides and children pools would keep them amused all day).Rooms were lovely and clean it was in a good location near the beach, restaurants shops etc. the staff are nice and friendly (the lady on the taxi desk very helpful) and different staff at the bar are very attentive. I would say the things that weren't as good but not a complete deal breaker was the breakfast- it isn't the best but if you don't mind going to the shop or just holding out till lunch time it isn't too bad. On the other hand, there is a lot of choice and you will be sure to find at least one or two things you can eat. Also found the pool restaurants food to be a bit greasy but still edible.

829,"We just stayed at the Orchid for four nights with our 1.5 year old. He LOVED the kids pool. THe kids pool had 4 different slides and ranged from .7 to 1 meter in depth. Perfect for kids. After writing to the hotel about the renovations of the kids club we arrived and renovations were still taking place. However, there was sun and lots of other things to do. On the day it rained the new kids club was open. Although it did not have any toys yet, the woman in charge did have a lot of paints and crayons for the kids to use. So, it worked out perfectly. The breakfast was ok at best. Rooms were basic but beach towels and water was free. We had a conversation with management and they were extremely helpful and patient. I have read many reviews from other people saying the staff did not smile. We found the cleaning staff, front desk, pool staff, and even the taxi guys very happy, but some staff who cook breakfast, not so much. The beach was a block away.

This Resort was okay for this price.I guess this resort was hot place long time ago. Now a days quite old but I could feel something, this place has a history.

831,"Near the beach but can't swim due to monsoon season. Anyway the hotel has great swimming pools with slides, jacuzzi and lots of beach chairs. It was nice to see lots of guest enjoying the pool. Breakfast was good as well. Quite a few restaurants around the hotel for a meal but not much shopping.The reason for the 2-star rating is because we stayed in connecting rooms and for some reason, one of the room just couldn't get the wifi and the TV just kept acting up after every 10 minutes or so. The other room with good wifi and TV had very warm air con and also kept having this funny clicking sound coming from around the aircon vent or near the toilet every 20 minutes or so even after complaining which made sleeping very difficult. Not to mention the corridor to the rooms is way too dimly litted, Lastly it seems some of the service staff didn't get the memo that Thailand is known as land of smiles....","September 16, 2018","14    Phuket Orchid Resort & Spa

There are two açaí bowl restaurants close to the hotel (2 mins walk). Apart from location, the room is clean & spacious. The layout of the hotel makes you feel like you are staying in a resort but the price you are paying is one-tenth of a resort price. There are two swimming pools in the hotel and so there are enough places for sunbath or swim. If you are going to Chalong for fitness activities, healthy food could be something you are looking for. Their raw fitness menu serves tasty healthy food with calories breakdown. I had ‘brown rice pancake with banana & peanut butter’ 3 times for breakfast & flax seed oatmeal pancake for breakfast once.

854,"My friend and I stayed for 10 nights over the months July/Aug 2018 - while training at Dragon MuayThai. Resort charges a ridiculous tariff on airport transfers, we nearly paid 1800baht - luckily a friend who was already there sent a taxi to pick us up for 800baht so we cancelled transfers with the resort.Rooms were fine and accommodating and well serviced/cleaned on request Reception staff were mostly helpful. Pools were lovely and courtyards are stunning. There were alot of renovations and repairs happening when we arrived which continued through our stay, lots of electrical cords/plugs and tools covering the floor in reception foyer. Not a big hassle, just an eye sore. Wifi wasn't that accommodating at all. Roaming cats that come into your room all the time. Restaurant was overpriced in comparison to many others we'd tried. I asked to buy 1 avacado which costed me 170 baht. Felt very ripped off. We decided to eat away at Signature, Dragon, Siam, Muscle Bar, Ali's BBQ as they were much nicer and fairly priced. Overall we were happy with our stay but would be more inclined to stay again if these things were addressed.","August 24, 2018","15    Cocoville Phuket

855,"I have never been compelled to write a review for anything in the past, but my experience at Cocoville was so exceptional I had to share my experience.I went to Chalong for a fitness holiday at Unit 27. I checked out all the hotels along the Soi, popping into the rooms and looking at the facilities. I chose Cocoville mainly because it had two pools and the rooms looked comfortable.I spent three weeks there in total, and I could not have wanted for anything else. Highlights were:-Exceptionally accommodating and friendly staff. No request was too big or too small. Super efficient and organized. The front desk ladies just get things done without a fuss and with a smile. They made me feel like a friend staying at their home. Knowledgeable and gave me some great advice while staying there. -Cleanliness: the room was in great condition when I checked in, and daily cleaning was available if requested. The whole hotel was always spotless and the team works around the clock to keep things in check. Fresh towels were provided every day.-Pools: well maintained, surrounded by lounge chairs and offer perfect mix of shaded (by trees) and open to the sun spots. Great for lounging. Big enough to do some cooldown laps with others in the pool. Pool towels provided by reception at no cost.-Restaurant: great selection of local and healthy options. Huge smoothie and protein shake range. Service time was super quick. I was content with every meal, and changes were made without a fuss and to my liking.-Wifi was great, laundry service very convenient, TV had a few English channels including a 24 hour movie channel, ABC (great for watching all the AFL games live), BBC, and a random sports channel that played golf mostly (I watched The Open live).-Check in and out was easy. -Location is right in the middle of all the training places (Unit 27, Titan, Tiger etc) but back a little bit from the main road. This was great as it was close to the action but far enough away from the bikes screaming along the Soi.-Shared workspace: There was a workspace (fit about 10ish people) that is free to use which is fully airconned and quiet, which would be great if you needed to do work while on holiday.-Aircon in the rooms worked well. -The rooms are set out in a bungalow type setup with masses of mature gardens surrounding each room. The surrounds are very well maintained and it had a very resort type feel. It was like staying in a jungle, but with all creature comforts available.-Water pressure was great in the rooms, and I couldn't hear anything in the adjoining rooms.I honestly don't have a negative thing to say about Cocoville and I can without reserve recommend it to anyone heading to Chalong for a fitness holiday, or just for a relaxing experience.","August 1, 2018","15    Cocoville Phuket

Also, the resort cats are welcoming and friendly too. We will definitely be back next year when we return to train again.

The road is busy but cocoville is set back from the road so noise was not an issue .We had time to go back have a bite to eat and go back to train. Our room was spacious and had kettle , toaster and microwave. Cleaned every day at your request .The restaurant offers healthy options so for people who are training and need things like a protein shake they have plenty to choose from . The staff are friendly and very polite.The grounds are well maintained and very clean .They offer a very cheap laundry service . We would definitely go back.","July 4, 2017","15    Cocoville Phuket

873,"I love this little gem of a place so much, I almost don't want to tell anyone... but I must pay credit where credit is due.We recently stayed at Cocoville for 5 nights with our 8 month old baby and had the best visit. Our trip was with a group of friends that stayed in multiple hotels within the area to be close to training facilities. Cocoville was the place everyone gathered because of the warm staff and incredible food. Cocoville is tucked away right off of the main road so it's nice and quiet. It's an unassuming hotel with nice clean facilities. Rooms are spacious and ours was equipped with a little kitchenette which made it easy with baby. The location is perfect for making a quick trip to train at Dragon, Tiger and Unit 27.Filip (the owner) takes pride in his beautiful hotel. His kitchen staff were warm and very helpful (even taking extra care to make sure our little guy was happy). Also worth noting that the sports massage offered at Cocoville was incredible. I'm a tough customer when it comes to a good massage (being a trained therapist myself) and I could not have asked for a better treatment for my aching muscles.We will be back soon for another visit!

878,"This property was recommended to me by a friend as it is close to Tiger. The staff were some of the friendliest I have ever encountered! They work both the reception and dining areas, so you tend to interact with the same people very often. Check-in was easy.I stayed in a Deluxe villa by the pool and reception area. It had 1-bedroom, a living room and good size bathroom. Definitely room enough for a couple. The villa looks out onto the pool area and has a small porch with chairs and a table. Even with the room being near the reception area and a well-traveled walkway, I did not hear much noise and was never disturbed. The bed was comfortable and the room was very clean. Do note that while there is a safe box in the room, it is very small. Ok for small items but not large enough for a lap-top.The restaurant menu caters to a fitness crowd with some wonderful healthy and tasty options. The quality of the food, price and service make it a popular place. You see many people having a meal prior to a workout. It was quite impressive.The pool area is quiet and relaxing. At no point have I seen it crowded or loud. There is a spa on-site as well but I did not have an opportunity to take advantage of it. The entire experience is a bit surreal but certainly in a good way. Paradise is an accurate description if you are here to exercise, eat well, relax and meet good people.I would definitely stay here again on my next visit and highly recommend it.","January 30, 2017","15    Cocoville Phuket

The room was kept clean and had two AC units, one for the living room and one for the bedroom. I really enjoyed lying by the the pool between my training sessions, enjoying the resorts delicious shakes (especially the chunky monkey and green energy), and met some great people there too. The best thing about Cocoville is the familiar atmosphere one has there with the guests and the staff. It has probably the best food on the street, so it's a lot of fun talking to the staff and eating the delicious food they serve.I will stay there again.","December 18, 2016","15    Cocoville Phuket

The laundry was great, drop your training gear or clothes off in the morning and pick it up the next morning for very cheap. The girls on reception very friendly.

The food is fresh and a perfect compliment for our training. We found many of other people staying in the village would come to Cocoville to eat at their restaurant as the food is great.

886,"I have been to Chalong (Soi Tad Ied) a number of times. Each time I went Cocoville had been booked out but I was so eager to try it out, on reputation. It was more expensive than other places we had stayed on the street but the grounds of this hotel are really special and maintained with real interest. The pools are both wonderful. The hotel is situated in the best possible place on the street. The services (laundry and cleaning) are so efficient. The rooms are clean and spacious. There’s air-conditioning, a fridge and a kitchenette in each room. The restaurant has a great selection of food. I hate adding negatives, but if there was one thing that upset me it was the attitude of some of the staff. We were put in a room to begin with that wasn’t great. It had a view of the water tanks and was on a main path through the complex so everyone else who was staying in Cocoville had view straight into our room as they walked by. We had to keep the curtains closed the entire time. We had booked some months in advance and it was low season so there wasn’t any real reason to put us there, other than maybe being seen as the path of least resistance. When we requested a change, the automatic reaction of the staff was to get defensive and refuse to budge without even checking availability in other rooms. 4 days into our 2 week-long trip they gave in and moved us to a great room and we loved it. It cost more but that was never the issue as we had told them we were happy to pay more and to be honest it was worth it. We travel all the time and these things happen so we wouldn’t have taken it so personally only there were a number of issues involving the attitude of some of the staff which felt unnecessarily aggressive and took the shine away from this little gem of a hotel. Other things worth noting… The hotel can arrange airport pick-up and drop-offs and they accept most major credit cards.Overall, we were not disappointed for having finally had a chance to stay here. And while I would definitely stay here again, I would equally not be madly disappointed if they were booked out and we had to stay somewhere else.","October 11, 2016","15    Cocoville Phuket

VI, Poo, Samson, Pluem & Lae are wonderful, warm and welcoming people. Many a evening was spent chatting with them. To all the other members of staff, sorry for not mentioning you by name, but your service made for wonderful memories. Dear Sunset Beach Resort Family, we will be back again next year!

You will have to go to patong beach for that which can be very commercialised. The hotel constantly had a sewer smell around it which wasn't nice but location was good as you have many street food vendors providing halal meat just outside. There is also a night market right next to the hotel which wasn't very developed yet but I'm sure its upcoming. My husband and I just hired scooters to get us around but be sure to wear your helmets at all time otherwise you WILL be fined. The hotel itself is old and not very pretty, the reception is basic and 2/3* max. The pool was decent but doesn't get much sunlight. The rooms are a good size but again outdated. The hotel staff isn't helpful at all, they don't speak much english and weren't very helpful with the fact that we had to check out at 12pm but our flight wasn't until 12am - they also didn't allow us to use their phone to call our airline to make a meal request.

945,"We stayed for 8 nights in this hotel from February 28-March 7 and were not disappointed. The hotel was very clean and staff were very friendly. The English was slightly lacking in many of the staff members but they always did their best to help us or find someone better suited to help us. The cleaning staff were wonderful and always did a good job keeping our room clean and fridge stocked with plenty of drinking water. Our air conditioner did break one day but a simple call to the front desk had a maintenance worker up to our room literally within 2 minutes and all was fixed. The hotel grounds were beautiful and well maintained. Pool area is in a private little section, surrounded by the hotel and trees, which was beautiful. The restaurant is very fairly priced and offers a wide range of delicious foods. The Hawaiian pizza was my favorite. The hotel offered an included a hot buffet breakfast each morning which was delicious and always left us satisfied.The only negative thing I would mention is that they charge you to use the in room phone, even for local calls. We were calling the airport several times to check on the status of our bags (because the airport had lost them) and I was provided a bill for this on check out. I was slightly annoyed because it had not stated anywhere that the phone costs money. But the charge was minimal (10 Baht/call) so I was not that upset. The shuttle service was wonderful, saving us lots of money on taxis. Located in the hotel parking lot and runs every half hour from morning til 9pm. Takes you from the hotel to Bangla Road (the main tourist area and Patong beach) and also back to the hotel again. A couple tourists recommended us to not take the shuttle but we could not understand why and took it anyways several times without any issues whatsoever. It seemed everyone was taking the shuttle with no problems, and it was also a nice opportunity to get to know some people staying in our hotel (approx. 15 min drive).Lastly, the beach: Yes, this hotel is located across the street from the beach, however, it is rocky and not swimmable. But, a simple two minute walk down the beach strip will lead you to a beautiful swimming area. Overall this is a beautiful hotel to stay in and I would highly recommend it to anyone seeking accommodations in Phuket.","March 11, 2019","16    Sunset Beach Resort

946,We stayed here for 4 nights. We checked in quite late but was greeted by a friendly reception. We got booked into a very noisy room right above the reception and against the road. The hotel moved us the following morning to a much better room viewing the pool area. I would definitely advise asking for a poolview room. The rooms are clean and the bed was nice. Also a very nice bathroom. Breakfast was also very nice and quite a good selection. Staff was helpful. Hotel restuarant was a bit under staffed and service was slow.

The staff seem very inattentive.. Upon arrival there is no one to help us with our luggages and we waited around 20 min to check in.. We arrive around 7pm and we are so tired and the poor services dissapoint us.. And the restaurant staff aslo not friendly.. I stay in 4 hotel during my recent trip to phuket and this hotel.

948,"One of the worst hotels we have ever stayed at, will never recommend this place. It felt like we were staying in a 1 star hotel next to a shanty town with a view of rubbish piled up outside the houses in the adjacent properties. There was a puddle of water with old smelly towels outside our door when we arrived, and the puddle was still there when we left 4 days later. The fruit at the breakfast buffet should be covered as there were little insects constantly hovering above. The bar was open until 12 midnight, so there were rowdy people every night who carried on drinking and making a noise until way after midnight and we could not sleep properly - we landed up sleeping on the beach! When we complained at reception they moved us to a Deluxe room which was even worse. The stench from the rubbish next door was so bad that we had to hold our nose every time we went into the room. The TV was not working properly, the plumbing was an issue, there was a bath but no shower, the aircon kept on making a constant ticking sound so we could not sleep. There was rubble on the balcony, and it felt as if they had not upgraded or maintained the property for years. The material on the chairs was tatty and the resort needs a fresh coat of paint. The resort was too far from the centre and the shuttle bus was often full. There is an alley between the reception and the hotel, the final straw was when we saw two big rats at reception one evening - we were so appalled that we left the next day. Our stay at the Sunset Beach was a nightmare, as soon as we moved to another hotel our entire holiday improved. We will never go back or recommend this place, the photos on the website must be old as this is not the quality we found.","February 18, 2019","16    Sunset Beach Resort

Bedrooms are good. Bathrooms had strong, hot showers. Good air con and good wi fi. Breakfast had a good selection. Other food was very good and only a little more costly than most of the eateries in the area. Shuttle bus to the beach was free and very useful.Staff were very very nice and helpful where possible.Shuttle from airport was expensive and as it was basically a taxi arranged by the hotel it is a lot cheaper to go to the taxi rank outside the arrivals terminal or, for a little more book your ride on line.","May 2, 2019","17    Alpina Phuket Nalina Resort & Spa

954,"My partner and I recently stayed in the grand suite at this resort. I was actually quite impressed with the size of the room. We had two bathrooms, both with big showers, and toilets, basins and also one with a jacuzzi spa. A seperate kitchen, and big room with bed and lounge area and desk and tv. The bedroom overlooked the pool area and was a nice view. The bed was big but quite hard, but I still slept well. The cleaning really wasn’t what you would expect of a resort or hotel really. It looked clean enough from distance but the shower was covered in soap scum and hadn’t been cleaned properly, if at all. And just a lot of things didn’t seem like much effort had been put into making the room as presentable as it could. But I wasn’t too fussed to be honest but still noticed. I’m sure if I complained they would have cleaned it the shower. The aircon actually didn’t work very well, if much at all. The room was 26 degrees at its coolest which sucked but was better than outside I guess. The ads list that they have ‘HIGH SPEED WIFI INTERNET’ but it’s literally almost non existent. I literally think I had better internet speed on dial up, no joke. There was also only two tv Chanel’s that we could watch as everything else was in Thai or not working at all. Overall I did love the size of the room, and view. The pool was nice but I think closed a bit early. We had free buffet breakfast everyday which was okay. Lots to get. We also had included with our room free mini bar (topped up everyday) which included about 6 soft drinks, 4 beers, lots of water, coffee, tea. Which we certainly took full advantage of, and was nice to have. Overall we had a nice stay, and would recommend it if your not to fussy!","April 8, 2019","17    Alpina Phuket Nalina Resort & Spa

Our room was a pool access room I’m building four , the room was very clean, tidy and had lodes of space , though it did feel a bit tired and slightly run down . The bathroom was a big let down , though clean and functional it was very out of date and the bath was all corroded and marked and he jets didn’t work . My sisters room next door had a lovely big shower that looked very new though . But there are so many good points about this place , and I would definitely visit again and recommend . Every member of staff we encountered were so nice and friendly , in particular to the baby’s . The pool was great , the food was great ( Tuesday night buffet was beautiful) the cocktails were great .

958,"I’m not sure where the reviews are coming from that say this hotel is beautiful. The only thing I can think of is that the reviewers have not stayed in very nice places before or they aren’t real reviews. It is simply put, not as pictured. I wanted to like this place very badly because I found the staff to be so pleasant and helpful, but it is the most run down place I have ever stayed, so I was glad we were only there for a few nights. We were upgraded to a pool villa or whatever they are called and everything was dingy and the bathroom was downright dirty. I don’t think I encountered anything that wasn’t chipped or old. We ordered some food from the restaurant and it was also not good. This is most definitely not a four star hotel and I would tell any friends going to Phuket to stay elsewhere.

Bed and room equipment left nothing to be desired. Also the big, general pool is very nice. Unfortunately I already have to come to the negative points. The private area is visible due to the height of the main house. The private pool is full of chemistry and can lead to skin irritations. On arrival there was blood on one of the cushions! The rain shower was defective. Both were repaired after complaint. At the check-in nobody told us that the minibar was included. The taxi stand in front of the hotel is extremely unfriendly, mafia-like and demands rip-off prices! Attention!

962,I have recently returned from a 3-week stay at the Alpina which I thoroughly enjoyed. I stayed for 1 week in a pool villa and another 2 weeks in a pool access room. The villa was luxurious and a real treat if you want to relax away from it all with your own pool (walled off from the rest of the resort) and I would recommend it whole-heartedly. The pool access rooms are also great and really great for the cost.The breakfast buffet is a must with a great selection and I found it set me up for the day and aside from an afternoon snack kept me going until my evening meal. The staff were all so friendly and really made me feel welcome.I can honestly say this is one of the best value resorts I've stayed in and is in a great location. Two of tripadvisor's 'Top Ten Beaches in Asia' (Kata Noi and Karon) are within 15-30 minutes walking distance!

963,"I think that the subject says it all... Hotel is well placed in the kata district not too far from the beach (even if the hotel provided us with free shuttle to the beach --> easily reachable by foot with a 6 years old) and the main attractions (touristy and/or local).We were lucky enough to have a room access pool at the back end of the resort where we had a mini private pool for 2 rooms (4102) and that was all the PLUS of our stay.This is our 3rd trip from europe to thailand and this is the first time that we are so disappointed by our hotel: - cleaning of the room was done so so every 2 days (we stayed for 2 weeks...)- ""complimentary"" coffee and tea were dropped off every 2 days (or when requested)...- rooms and furnitures really need an upgrade (peeling paint, whirpool bath so not working, moskito repellent dropped off every 3 days...)Worst of all was that we do know Thailand as the ""smile country"" and we were so disappointed when almost NONE of the staff at the reception greeted us during our stay (2 weeks stay). Our son has to yell: ""HELLO"" every single day for us to be greeeted by the staff. The only person who greeted us was a nice lady from a representative tour operator (without the yelling - they were polite enough to return the greetings...)We will never go back to this hotel because it is now a transit hotel which do not care for their long term guests and do not even recognized them as long stayed guests. Go their for a night or two but not more.(and do not even want to talk about the early call in the morning with no one who will answert the call..., staffs for whom english is fully foreign (we are so not native english speaker - fully fluent in many other languages...)","September 5, 2018","17    Alpina Phuket Nalina Resort & Spa

Pros: huge pool, great drinks, very interesting accommodations, patient staff, wide-variety at the breakfast buffet, off the beaten path so not as noisy, excellent price for private transport to/from airport, private villas are gorgeous & well worth the upgradeCons: dated rooms, very hard beds with limited pillows [2], lots of mosquitoes, long outdoor walk to your room (i.e. if it's raining you'll be soaked by the time you get there), very slippery walkway entrances to buildings, lots of added fees for things like taking drinks or food to go from the breakfast buffet, long drive from the hotel [at least an hour without traffic]","April 12, 2018","17    Alpina Phuket Nalina Resort & Spa

982,"I have stay here for 6 nights with my family and I was so regret I should choose other resort. I found their website have a great deal, include the cooking class and dinner, also I read other people review I thought it will be great resort to meet my family in Phuket so I send a mail to them and get a good deal with late check out, we choose here to stay 6 nights. Check in - The check in was not good experience, we arrived around 8pm and the front desk staff ""Tee"" didn't know about our deal and she looks not happy and tired. I have to double check everything and she reject my request until I tried to show her the mail I have discussed with front office manager and she called, I have my 2 years old who was really tried and the check in took about 30 minuses. it was not really nice start...Room - we booked 3 rooms and we have young kids and Elderly but they give us the room are old and far away from swimming pool,the paintwork is clipped and flaking. I was so disappointed!! I believe this resort are great 10 years ago, because overall design is great but they didn't look after wellKids club - we were look forward the kids club, but it was dirty and water leaking. the toys are old ,broken and unsafe to playPool - the main pool is really deep, if you want to go water spa you have walk long way, although they do have kid pool but too far away from water spa, if you have young kid you have to stay in kid pool all the time and no shade. the pool close at 7pm is too early!Housekeep - I am not sure what I should expect the house keep, when I have question about the housekeeper didn't clean our mug and cup,a lot ant around our cup, I called front desk to ask and they hung out my phone and call me 2 minuses later tell me ""the housekeeper doesn't need to clean the cups"" (I was thinking that's unusual but okay I can wash up) however 10 minuses later, the housekeeper came and she has no idea what happen and very worry and not happy. I tried to explain to her but she cannot understood so she called the front desk and she is nearly crying, so I just said to her that's okay and she keep say sorry and really sorry...I feel really bad for her and I really upset about if you called me back already, what's point to send housekeeper to me and didn't know what's happen.Cooking class - The cooking class was unprofessional, the chef can't speak English well and didn't know how to teach. we didn’t know exactly what they were doing at the beginning. However we still had a good time, the food is good. Check out - it was disaster, I have already check with front desk ""Tee"" when I check in we could check out 4pm. However she forgot it and keep called and Knock our door when my boy and my family had a nap, I was out and when I back to resort around 2pm and she run to me said I have to check out and I said to her, you are the one did my check in and you forgot it, do I need to show you the mail again? after they said okay but no any apologize.....Also,I found out the staff forget how to smile, I was have a great trip when I was Aonang Phu Petra Resort, Krabi, we also stay there 6 nights...The Alpina Phuket Nalina Resort & Spa is big disappointed!!!!","April 8, 2018","17    Alpina Phuket Nalina Resort & Spa

984,"We stayed at Alpina in Phuket and a much more upmarket hotel in Bangkok but would have to say, Alpina had the edge on service and staff. Like a number of other hotels in Phuket, Alpina is older and facilities could do with an upgrade, but front desk staff and the hotel taxi service made life easier and our stay so much more enjoyable. Thank you Kathy Bosstiwek and Mr Pong! Kathy helped us organise (more economically) taxi runs from Kata to Talang (these are not cheap) and answer any touristy-type questions we had. When we couldn't get a driver, she kindly ran us out to Talang, and secured a driver for a second outing. Communication can be a problem in Thailand so it was a bonus to deal with a manager who speaks excellent English and who goes the extra mile. Mr Pong runs the hotel's taxi service (local taxi was surprisingly more expensive) and was very helpful, suggesting activities and getting us to sights quickly. Both were very generous, coaching us local Thai lingo and protocols! Alpina is pretty central, has a good pool and we loved the way it is nestled up against hills, with a view of the back of the head of the Big Buddha. The Alpinabreakfast was excellent with both Thai and western dishes. Our Bangkok hotel had a bigger buffet but was surprisingly disappointing. Local service as we experienced at Alpina, is not guaranteed in Bangkok.","February 17, 2018","17    Alpina Phuket Nalina Resort & Spa

986,"Thank you Alpina Phuket Nalina Resort & Spa for a fantastic stay!We stayed at 3 different hotels for our trip to phuket, while we loved the other 2, we stayed at Alpina the longest and we are already talking about our next trip back.We booked the thainess package and got a room upgrade. (which was unexpected in peak season) the room was amazing!! Our own balcony with direct access to the pool. We were beyond stoked! I researched a lot of hotels in phuket and still think Alpina's was the best. Massive, with separate kids pools with Lots of little nooks to escape people. There were lots if different types of people staying here, which makes sense as its perfect for family's but big enough for couples to have quiet chilled time together.The resort offered a free bus to the beach every hour but we (a couple in our 30s & 40s) preferred the walk and explore each day. Was only about a 10-15min walk but you pass heaps of shops, restaurants & those delicious ice-cream stalls the whole way. We found that walk from the hotel to the beach enjoyable enough that we did it 1-3 times a day sometimes. The buffet breakfast was large and varied with something to please everyone. We really loved the setting of the resort, it's kind of perched on a lagoon with hundreds of fish (which the boyfriend loved)I read some reviews before we arrived about the resort being old and outdated. We didn't find that at all and wonder just how fussy and delusional people can be. We will definitely be coming back! Also would like to thank one of the ladies (the taller one) on the desk the day we check out. We checked out at 12 but our flight wasn't until 10pm so we were allowed to leave our bags and left for the beach for the last time when we got back we were hot, gross and sweaty and she offered us use of the showers with towels and soap before our flight. We were extremely grateful.Thanks again Alpina, we'll see you again!","January 31, 2018","17    Alpina Phuket Nalina Resort & Spa

The air conditioning did not work and there was a lizard in our room. The room was clearly not checked.The tried to downgrade us to an worse room without a shower and two single beds. We disagreed. The very unfriendly and aggressive receptionist said that the only person to fix the problem is the manager, who is back tomorrow. And if we don't take the downgraded room they would kick us out. ""Sleep on street, no money back, go"" in a very aggressive tone.We had to call the police who tried to get us to another hotel but this hotel refused to pay our money back to be able to book somewhere else! The local police advised us to file a complaint in Bangkok with the right authorities.The hotel agreed with the police that if we stayed one night in the downgraded room they will give us the room we payed for the next day.It is now 01:00 and we hope we do get the room we paid for.In my decades of travel, I have never had such an unfriendly and aggressive receptionist and such terrible service.Stay away from this hotel and if you have no other choice but this hotel then don't prepay as they will try to scam you once they have your money!","January 23, 2018","17    Alpina Phuket Nalina Resort & Spa

989,"We stayed for 7 nights in one of the private pool villas. Pros:- Villa very spacious. Private pool big. Great air conditioning. Great for a longer stay. - Housekeeping polite and competentFree hourly shuttle bus down to Kata beach useful Cons:- Poor wifi connectivity in room and lobby - Hotel’s concierge/lobby staff’s English was unfortunately poor and below what we expected from hotel staff. Communicating with staff was sometimes difficult for others, including us. Getting a taxi from the lobby was difficult on several occasions with the limited English (even when we made a booking the morning of the taxi booking). - Hotel’s transfer service wasn’t great and was a confused process even after we booked weeks in advance. Again, this comes from the poor English. Would recommend travellers consider organising your own transfers with an external company. - Compulsory New Year’s Eve buffet was overpriced and disappointing. No drinks (including water) were included in the very high price. Charge for bringing your own bottle of water or soft drink was 1200THB!!!!

990,"We had several issues with this hotel. The pictures online make the hotel look like a gorgeous resort. Spoiler alert: it doesn't look anything like the pictures. It's very old and dirt. It also isn't anywhere near the beach in a beach town, and you have to take a ten minute shuttle to get to the beach.As I mentioned, this hotel is very very old and dirty. It looks like they haven't put any money into it in 30 years to fix it up. Our room was a fine size, but I have nothing else positive to say about it. In the room we found mosquitoes. There was dust everywhere. The bathroom mirror was filthy. I complained to the front desk manager who was of no assistance at all and incredibly rude.We tried to make the best of it and make plans for the day and night. We went to the concierge to ask about what the town has to offer. First off, she barely spoke english and was on her phone the whole time. She was able to show us posters and pamphlets for a few tour options, but couldn't help with any follow up questions at all. We asked about timing of different events, distance to areas in the town, etc, and she did not know the answer to any of these inquiries. I was under the impression this was the concierge's responsibility. Breakfast was also nearly inedible. There were flies all over the food and awful service.For the price you can absolutely find better accommodations.

992,"This hotel at one point was probably a very nice resort-- that being said there are some pros and some cons. I will be unbiased as possible to provide a better idea of the property.Check in experience: Very pleasant and quick. They upgraded our room to a pool entrance at no extra charge. This was a pretty view of the pool and the mountain side and you could enter a private pool from your balcony. Room: Was very outdated and not cleaned well. Quick glance would appear clean but their level of clean is not what I would call clean. The walls were filthy, even had dead bugs stuck to the wallpaper. Bathroom was nice but shower ceiling was falling down. Room smelled of moth balls. Desk had papers from another guest still in the drawers. Bed was extremely uncomfortable. As previous reviewers stated, it was SO hard. Felt like sleeping on a cardboard box. Property: Overall resort grounds are well kept. Pool is immaculate- however- was very dead. Very few people out by the pool/ drinking at the bars. Restaurants were also very dead. I never ate onsite but breakfast is 400 baht/ person and from what I hear is not very good. There are breakfast buffets within walking distance for 200 baht/person so they are very overpriced.Location: This resort is on an end street. It is not next door to the beach. It is roughly a 15 minute walk along all the massage shops/ tourist shops. So if you are looking for an on the beach hotel this is not it. The on the beach resort would be the Beyond Kata Resort.Overall: If you are just looking for a place in Kata Beach this is it. I would recommend Karon beach over Kata beach because it is cleaner and more ""beach"" feeling. Kata beach is dirtier, more shops, and (besides the beach) doesn't feel like a relaxing atmosphere. Although this resort was OK, it was honestly probably one of the nicer ones in the area. Most hotels appear run down and not up to par with what an American would consider a 4-5 star hotel.","December 6, 2017","17    Alpina Phuket Nalina Resort & Spa

Temperature in the room, during the day at best 25C/77F with blinds closed and AC running all day. Next issue is their really poor Wi-Fi. They have 3-5 routers for guests for the whole resort. You have to sit on balcony to be able to use it. They also tried to scam us on price in their breakfast buffet restaurant, when we checked in and before we sat down they told us one price and when bill came it was another. We had to call manager to resolve the issue, the people in restaurant would not work with us.

1000,"We enjoyed our stay at Alpina, in a pool access room. If you are looking for a resort with an ocean view, this is not the place. It is set back about 700 m from the oceanfront, with a view of a hillside behind it where you can see the top of big Buddha's head. We enjoyed seeing the mist on the mountain some mornings. Our initial room was pretty basic but had all we needed - a lovely rainfall shower and pool access in a very private part of resort - room 3108. It had a view of the hillside and its lovely mist in the morning. It was away from main pool but we could swim to the end of this pool then climb out from ladder to get to main pool for happy hour. After the first 5 nights we'd had problems with our toilet and I got in touch with reception, who promptly moved us to an upgraded room - a grand suite with pool access. This room was amazing, with a jacuzzi, kitchen, lounge, king sized bed (not two beds pushed together) and pool access right near the poolside bar. I recommend this room - 2101. This room had a view of the pool access pool and main pool. Heaven! Stay in block 2 for pool access if you want to be closer to main pool and reception. Stay in grand suite pool access for a special experience. Stay in block 3 if you'd like more privacy - just remember you can't see main pool from there. Everything including ocean is walking distance and flat. So no hills unless you're taking the shorter way to get to Kata night markets (highly recommended). And that's a short hill. Consult google maps to get directions. Shout out to the bartenders who made us great cocktails - try mojito and piña colada at happy hour. Two for one - so 100 baht each. Also we'd like to thank reception who responded to requests and problems quickly. I felt for these guys who often say good morning to guests without so much as a reply. We can't thank you enough. First 3 photos are of room 3801. They also decorated our bed honeymoon style. Remainder are resort and our second room - 2101. ","October 7, 2017","17    Alpina Phuket Nalina Resort & Spa

1003,"I recently stayed at the hotel 09/01/17 through 09/04/17 and I won't be staying there ever again for several reasons. Check-in was a breeze and probably took us 5 mins and staff was very pleasant.. We were escorted to the room which was on the 4th floor but was room 2403?? I'm not sure how that worked. I thought the first number was the floor number. Anyway, we get to the room and the minute we walked in I was immediately disappointed. The room had an overwhelming smell of mothballs. The second thing is the room was way smaller than it looked in the pictures or description and looked pretty old. I know and understand it's an older hotel but it looked like it needed major upgrades. I got a call from the front desk asking about the room about 10 minutes after we'd arrived which was nice but I couldn't explain my concerns over the phone because whomever called couldn't speak English so I had to go to the lobby to explain my concerns. I asked for a different room which I was told I'd have to pay an extra 1000 Baht per night so before I agreed, I asked to see the room. The room I was shown looked just like mine, smelled like mothballs, but had the pool attached to the balcony which was the only plus. I asked about the mothball smell and the reception lady didn't know what I was talking about. So I didn't get a different room, I just aired out my room and the smell slightly subsided by the 2nd day. On check out day we asked for a late check out which original check-out was noon and I had to pull teeth to be allowed to stay till 2pm at no charge. Our flight out to Bangkok did not leave till 10pm and had a driver arriving at 7pm so we sat in the lobby with absolutely NO air conditioning for 5 hours. Do you know how hot Phuket is? So for 5 hours no one came to offer us a glass of water, see if we were okay, NOTHING!!! I asked them to turn on the ceiling fan for comfort but that thing rotated slower than molasses. Never again. We stayed in Bangkok before our arrival to Phuket at Aloft and I will definitely be visiting them again. Not this place.","September 7, 2017","17    Alpina Phuket Nalina Resort & Spa

1004,"Staying at this hotel as I review - September 2017. Really nice hotel, peaceful, lovely pool area with a beautiful forest backdrop where you can see the Big Buddha. Lots of sun beds available, big pool, jacuzzi area and two pool areas suitable for children. We have a swim up room which has been ideal as we are here with our 2yr old grandson who has loved being able to get straight into the pool (wearing safety vest).Rooms are very nice and have air conditioning which has been great as the heat is really strong. Rooms are cleaned daily and bottled water supplied FOC as is the safe, the beds were very firm but really comfy and bedding changed daily. Beach towels are provided as is a small bus down to the beach - also very nice and water lovely and warm. Buffet breakfast had something for all of our tastes. Staff were all very nice and helpful. There is a gym, sauna and massage area - though we didn't use them. Only fault if I'm being really picky is the room needs decorating but not so bad that it caused any problem with our stay. I would definitely recommend this hotel to family and friends. We've had a lovely stay ","September 3, 2017","17    Alpina Phuket Nalina Resort & Spa

When i requested them to give us a bigger room at an additional cost as my daughter got hurt twice with the sharp edges of the tables in the room, they said all the rooms are of the same size & you should take care of your kids yourself.

Good sized rooms, ours had 2 x double beds, comfortable feel. 3 pools 1 x adult, 1 family with 2 slides (which was quite chaotic), and another more chilled out family pool. The staff were very helpful/friendly - twice offering us a lift in the golf cart to from our room as they were just passing. The rooms/corridors are a little dated and tired looking, but the gardens and grounds are well maintained and nice. Gym and kids club is good. Breakfast area is huge and quite noisy and busy so not a great environment, but an ok selection of food. One thing that was a bit puzzling was the egg/omelette station was the same place as where you had to pick up bacon from - which caused queues as people were waiting for their omelettes infront of others who just wanted bacon. It's a small thing but a bit annoying.The hotel is still a great place to stay particularly for families, and a great location in the middle (but set far enough back to be peaceful) in Karon.","June 25, 2019","18    Centara Karon Resort Phuket

1030,"We really enjoyed our stay here and my husband wants to start saving money again straight away to come back again soon. We stayed for 14 nights and the last 3 days were mostly rainy but the rest of the trip was sunny, plus the resort and Karon Beach were really empty so it was a great time of year to come if you don't enjoy the crowds. Karon is a good area for restaurants and we regularly went to the Mart outside the hotel.We couldn't fault our pool cabana. The location was perfect, right outside the playground and lagoon pool was great for our 3 kids ages 2-7. My 7 year old and I celebrated our birthdays here and were given vouchers. We used our private pool multiple times a day and it was cleaned well daily. I did see a drone flying over our private courtyard which I thought was a bit off. The room was kept clean nicely, although housekeeping did tend to come at inconvenient times for us as my son naps around midday, plus one Sunday we had the 'do not disturb' sign up but they rang the bell, disturbing my son trying to nap, which those with kids will understand is annoying. There was always grounds staff working and the grounds looked immaculate.The breakfast was delicious and the staff were so friendly. Everyone seemed to love the kids and everyone always talked to them, even the smiley security guards. There were no pizzas during the first half of our stay, and we never saw banana roti at breakfast, even though we were there 15 days and the sign said roti was on rotation. These were 2 things I was looking forward to after reading rave reviews here.It took us a while to find the entertainment. The first week we didn't see them at all and we were disappointed as we booked because of all the great comments on trip advisor about the four enthusiastic and fun entertainers. We finally worked out how to find them in our 2nd week (there is an activity poster near the restaurant). There are currently only 2 females working as entertainers as the other group that we read about must have left at the end of May. Next time we will check the dates the full team of entertainers are working before booking.My 5 year old got locked in 2 different toilets during our stay here. Not sure if it was the locks fault or our daughters. ;-) As yet the hotel hasn't followed up with us, even though they took our room number for one of the incidents. We also left a pair of googles at the pool by accident and when we went back the next day, they said they gave them to someone else. I've given 5 stars as our holiday here was amazing and unforgettable. We hope to come back.

1040,We had an amazing stay at centara Karon. The hotel is in an excellent location and the staff were awesome. Nothing was a problem in fact they were problem solvers. We were initially in a room that had adjoining doors and there was a slight problem with noise as the guests next door had young children who were very noisy. The balcony also was above what we know know as the kids pool which you could hear kids playing in the morning. No problem. Shifted to another room in a different area. Problem solved. The buffet breakfast was the best I have had throughout Southeast Asia. All the staff are amazing. So friendly. The resort facilities are terrific. One drawback is that the adults only pool becomes a kids fest on Fridays. Surely it could just remain an adults only pool throughout. We will definitely be returning.

1047,This was our 2nd stay at the Centara and it was excellent once more. Stayed in a ground floor room at the lagoon pool which was nice and easy for access. The last time we stayed it was high season and this time it was low and the hotel was a lot quieter. On our first visit we would eat breakfast in the azure restaurant but this time only the main buffet restaurant was open in the morning. This was fine but I did prefer the more relaxed vibe of azure. The Baht bonanza is a great way to save some money. The room was a little tired but for the price we paid it was excellent value and perfectly acceptable.,"June 8, 2019","18    Centara Karon Resort Phuket

1062,"I originally planned to stay for 7 nights with my wife and our 2 kids, in two rooms but we ran away after 3 nights.We arrived from another 5-star resort in a close by location at 1 pm. At check in were advised that our 2 rooms were not ready as it was a bit early. We said ”no problem, we will have lunch and come back at 2 pm”. On our way back at 2:15 pm we noticed that our bags were still on the kerb at the entrance, so I approached the staff at the front desk who were clearly not ready for the check-in and started calling other staff and running back and forth. Eventually, they escorted us to our rooms at around 2:30 pm.We left our kids in one room and we went in our room. As soon as we went in, I went to use the toilet and I noticed long black hairs in the bathroom and pubic hair. The same in the bathroom. Simply ferell! I've never asked for a room to be recleaned until now. God know when was the last time they cleaned the shower and WC.Funnily enough, in the meantime my wife opened the bar fridge to get a cold drink and discovered that everything inside was HOT and the fridge wasn’t working. The white rug in front of the bed was full of soil bebrit and black marks.We called Reception and asked for someone to come back and clean the room and fix the fridge. At this point we were talking to the “Welcome Manager” (Monika) that didn’t seamed too surprised or apologetic about all this. After a few minute as it was well after 3pm we left the room and went to the pool.On our way back we inspected the room that at this point was visually clean. On our way back from dinner I went to get a bottle of water from the fridge and I noticed that the fridge STILL wasn't working. I called Reception at around 10pm. They sent someone with a replacement fridge.WOW totally unimpressed. The Pullman was sold to us as a 5 star resort as part of my silver membership accord plus.....ummmm no chance!The next day, I really tried to move on with this terrible welcome and give them another chance, so we spoke to a lovely Spanish girl at the reception and when we explained our situation and complaint was very emphatic advising that she would seek assistance from the Welcome Manager. No reply provided to date. I'm so happy that we left to another resort which was amazing and immensely superior.......for half the price!!We have given 2 stars as encouragement to the staff but really would have given nil stars !

1063,"This is an older resort, but classic, beautiful and timeless. Well away from the noisy, busy seediness of the West coast beach areas. Bear this in mind if you'd rather be in a location with more 'action'. These certainly plenty do to and see around the Cape area but not thumping nightlife.Our private pool suite was beautifully appointed, exceptionally private and housekeeping was top notch. I can recommend these beautiful little oases as an exceptional respite. The suites are generous and lush.Main poolside areas are generous and gorgeous although some small sections of the pool need tiling maintenance, a very minor visual issue given the grandeur of this huge, delectable beachside pool.The service poolside was exceptional and the food is great. All drinks and food is reasonably priced for a 5star resort too.The 'Junction' area topside', where some unique and seriously tasty cocktails are made and served by some talented mixologists, was a little too hot for comfort due to its unfortunate design soaking up the sun all day, although visually stunning. A few misting, bubbling fountains would easily fix that.My biggest issue by far was the wide ranging allowance for smokers throughout the resort, certain tourists have a propensity for the ciggies and it was overly prevalent (despite the resort being very quiet) which was odiferously unfortunate, we had to vacate a number of times because they just seem to allow smoking anywhere. Some primary traffic areas were 'smoking lounges' and no way through the resort without passing by, last thing you want first thing freshly showered in the morning. I dread to think of how much smoking goes on when it's busy! Pee-eew!We also had some amatuerish service issues at Tamarind on the one night we ate, but once sorted all good and the food is absolutely superb! - not to be missed!The smoking and the missed service at Tamarind took an otherwise 5 star review down to 4.I would certainly go again in a heartbeat, but I hope management do something in the interim to constrain the smokers everywhere.","July 7, 2019","19    Pullman Phuket Panwa Beach Resort

The room was very spacious and clean. Toiletries were provided, including toothpaste and toothbrush, but we always travel with our own products. Our bath water was running brown and there was a blockage in the toilet but after calling reception they sent a plumber who fixed this within minutes. When the restaurant was busy at breakfast, staff did forget to ask if we wanted coffee on two occasions. We found it best to go to breakfast a little later when the restaurant was quiet. The main pool staff are friendly and lunch is great. I am normally bitten by mosquitos and was using incognito products. However, there did seem to be a problem with bed bugs. Staff were quick to deal with the issue but nothing seemed to help. I just gave up as we were having an amazing time and did not want some little bugs to ruin our time.

1068,"the birds and mosquitoes flying too freely around! I love the service, the people, the room, the pool, the private beach, complimentary kayaking.. the list of things a private beach resort will have! Everything I love it. It’s just such a pity that birds and mosquitoes can’t seem to leave the serene premise alone. I was actually quite surprised that no one was dining at the beach club, then I found out that it’s not too good to dine there. The birds appeared once there’s food served. A bird actually picked up my noodles on my plate, unnoticed by the waiter apparently. Because he was holding the tray over his shoulder. So we had to ask for a replacement, which was gladly done. For the next 15 mins we tried to eat our food but was shooing the birds away all the time. We got so tired that we requested to bring our food indoors. So we had it in one of the closed restaurant. In the 30 mins my kids and I were sitting there, they had gotten at least 6-8 mosquitoes bites on their legs. Well then we tried again the next morning to dine outdoors which was at the restaurant patio. The same thing about the birds happened again. And we were so afraid that the birds will poo on our food haha. It’s definitely dine with nature if you love that experience. But not for us. We felt invaded. So we had to move in to the restaurant again. So I have missed all the chances to dine at the pool and dine outdoors. That’s the disappointing part. Otherwise everything else is perfect.

She is very friendly and efficient. The bell boys are equally friendly. The resort has made some changes, all good I would say. We were impressed with the breakfast at Aqua. The spread and placement of the food stations are great, with wider selections and better quality. Personally I love the noodles station best. The only downside is the pesky flies, and mosquitoes. They land on the food so it’s rather bad. Can something be done about this? In addition, maybe more fans can be installed at the external seating area so that we can enjoy the view and food at the same time. Excellent service from the wait staff. Love the tea pots and tea cups! The new beach lounges were a delight. The beach is well maintained. The only minus point is the room. The furnishings are a bit old and could do with some upgrading. The floor had some stains on them. We can’t wait to come back next year and see what’s in store for us. Perhaps a couple of Pullman kittens to make it more homely ?

The view is breathtaking! Large balconies are ideal to sit and enjoy a room service dinner overlooking the bay. The general manager is very present on the hotel property and open for chatting. Another nice addition. Small thing also that makes a difference for me: the water bottles in the room have the little, annoying plastic wrap already removed prior to room delivery. This means that, when thirsty, I can just pick up the water, unscrew the cap, and drink. No wasting time picking at the plastic with my finger or biting it off with my teeth. Better for the environment too, as the hotel can control disposal of this plastic rather than have it discarded everywhere. Overall, this hotel is fantastic.

Monica ensured that we were comfortable and were given a wonderful experience during our stay. Thank you Pullman Phuket Panwa Resort and we will definitely see you again.King Regards Diana and Sukh,"May 13, 2019","19    Pullman Phuket Panwa Beach Resort

1075,"We spent 6 nights at the Pullman Phuket Panwa Beach Resort, and left feeling we had made good friends with a variety of staff including Ben, Bow, Dada, Ridwan and most of the reception team. While the hotel itself is stylish, contemporary and airy, it's certainly smaller than the hotel website gives the impression of, and that's a good thing. It's smaller, intimate, and has a commanding view over Panwa bay, which makes for beautiful sunrises. The hotel's best features include the expansive pool area and Tamarind restaurant, both serving great food and drinks, with excellent warm Thai service. There are also a handful of restaurants and bars at the doorstep, but apart from that, everything is a taxi-ride away. Our tip is head for all-inclusive, and while that means limited menus, there's plenty to keep you satisfied, including cocktails, decent wines and good menus from both food outlets. It was the prefect place to switch off for a few days, certainly not for those wanting to enjoy the crazy nightlife of Patong. And should we return to Phuket, we'd certainly consider staying here again.","May 11, 2019","19    Pullman Phuket Panwa Beach Resort

1080,"We stayed in Pullman for 5 nights over Easter holidays,2 families including 5 kids and enjoyed our resort very much for our first time in Thailand.Checkin was simple and welcome drinks appreciated with the 3 rooms allocated to us in a convenient location and as requested.Breakfast was a massive hit with everyone, especially the vegan corner.Activities included in resort were used a few times and much appreciated especially considering other resorts charge extra. we used kayaks, paddle board, thai boxing, yoga and loved each single one.Food was very good in thai restaurant although we did not opt for the buffet night which was quite expensive and quiet atmospherebeach party was appreciated and everyone had a great time because it was so well organised by Adrian, Alba and Lucia who for us gave us the best customer service. Having used the reception desk to enquire into ferries to krabi, we did not find them as knowledgeable as they could be as only offered one ferry company. we ended up taking a taxi to port to book ourselves at the time and price we wanted.Yoga classes were appreciated except last one which was only 35 minutes and not the hour.Mosquitos were a major issue for all of us and no amount of Jungle spray reduced our bites however purchasing the local lemongrass spray from pharmacy across road helped but we did not suffer any more bites at any other resort.Local restaurants visited were Swasadee ( with live band), Treetop, Panwa cafe ( especially for deserts which were amazing) and the curry night.For massages, mostly visited Mook Anda but also small massage place directly opposite resort.Used the laundry services outside of resort ( opposite resort in between pharmacy and mini market) and only paid £2 for a kilo of clothes to be washed,dried and ironed. Gym in resort was used and very well liked especially the only place where there was ACVisited big bhudda which was nice, bangla road ( not as nice) as well as cashew factory nearby and old town all by using taxis opposite that dont charge as much as hotel but still charge tourist prices.Things to improveLack of Air conditioning, especially for breakfast and in reception is a major letdown especially in 40 degrees heat.No evening entertainment except for the one night where small beach party was givenDue to being low season was very quiet in resort which can also be nice but having only got the option of going to restaurants opposite or a £30 taxi ride to old town, evenings were quiet for us.Kids did try to go kids club but no staff were there.Overall very good resort in a very quiet area.","April 25, 2019","19    Pullman Phuket Panwa Beach Resort

1081,"Our Holiday was made when we met Nat at the reception. Whom did all his effort to move us to a more private pool villa. Nat was extremely helpful, kind and very friendly. He even helped us to enrol in Pullman program. He was very helpful and attentive all during our stay.I would also like to thank Cheif Oil, Luka, Deen, Oat, Sarip, (Mali who was on internship), Dream, Amy, Art, Eve, Jan, Evan and Chada at the reception .. team in the breakfast area and housekeeping. Mainly all the hotel team also the charters team who drove us to the mall, porters ,,,I really hate miss anyone forgive me if I did.. they were all very helpful delightful.And honestly, a beautiful hotel is made by it is team and hospitality.  Villa 2015 for complete privacy of the pool spacious beautiful, view of the ocean and big pool. It is a bit isolated but that what we were looking for.The hotel location is excellent specially the best Restaurant, The Panwa cafe that I highly recommend, is across the road. Also a local massage shop Mook Anda, mini market and Pharmcy. Don't let the beauty of the hotel and beach scene captivate you.. just get out and explore the area and go for walks :) I have tried the hotel spa and also Mook Anda massage for real thai massage which is across too. I recommend both :)Again If it wasn't for Nat we wouldn't have enjoyed our stay because a villa with strictly private pool is what we wanted.

1082,"Great Staff and excellent servicePerfect recognition for Accor Group members.If you can afford, make your choice on a pool Villa with sea view for privacy and disconnection from the busy world (we have loved our 2 night stay!)The villa is very beautiful and intimate (you have to provide pool towels in villa).The reception is very professional: Monica was waiting for us with a lot of attention. Lucia (Spanish and speaking good French) kindly drove us to our villa.Room service is extremely efficient, fast and delicious. Congratulations Khun Sea! You have done so well and so special for us! The value for money food and drinks is very good.The Spa is very nice and the treatments of good quality with interesting packages.It is necessary to improve: Too loud music at the pool (and often too crowded). Beach boys should be more attentive to waste on the beach.Music too strong everywhere in general and unsuitable for different times of the day. Too bad.Yoga could be practiced in a more intimate and lower Sala.Congratulations to all; you are very hospitable and professional.","April 15, 2019","19    Pullman Phuket Panwa Beach Resort

1088,"I sit here in the airport contemplating our honeymoon stay at Pullman. Admittedly, my expectations were high. We sprung for the private pool villa with the Andaman Sea View. This was the hotel I was looking most forward to on our two week honeymoon in Thailand. So, let’s start with the airport pick-up. When we arrived, we followed the instructions of the e-mail we received and went outside to the Pullman representative. He claims we are not on his list. We insist we are. He then directs us to step to the side and began helping another passenger. We had confirmed our booking for a private luxury vehicle transport months in advance. I also confirmed a few days ahead. We stood in the heat for 15 minutes trying to get ahold of the hotel. When finally connected, the agent who answered said for us to go to the airport representative again and hung up. So, we went to him again and I said for him to call hotel. After a total of 30 minutes waiting outside, they finally got things straight and got us into our vehicle. When we arrived, we were surprised at the amount of deposit requested. They asked for 13,000 THB. Though, they did say that included our transportation fees and our romantic dinner we planned. After stating we simply didn’t have that much of a deposit, they allowed for us to bypass the deposit which was very helpful. They just kept our card in file. So, we get to the room which was on the furthest end of the resort. No big deal if you are capable of walking up and down sidewalks with slight inclines. But, for people who find it difficult to get around I’m not sure what they would do. Anyway, we walk into the room and it is just as pictured. The dramatic master suite with the large bathroom is breathtaking for sure! Beautiful room, quality bedding, and many extra comforts are provided. We were excited, until we got to the patio. The patio, with the pool smelt horrible. A mixture of sewage and seafood describes the smell well. We tried to get past the smell and decided to dip our feet into the pool as we sat on the ledge. That’s when things got worse. After a few moments, I decided to get up and go inside. The floor below the pool is so slick, that after just placing one foot on it ( one foot in stairs and one foot on floor) I slipped. I fell hard. I cut open two toes and scraped my ankle. I fell hard on my knee, causing it to be painful for the rest of my trip. My husband got out of the pool to help me and slipped too. We got first aid to our room to help bandage me up. As he fixed me up, he informed me that I should not get it wet for at least four days and that I should call him twice a day to come clean it and re-bandage it. So, for the four days I was at the resort, I was given instruction not to go in the water. Wow. Great start to a honeymoon. After the incident, we decided to go to dinner. At dinner we saw another person with a wrapped up ankle limping around. Certainly it couldn’t be for the same reason...could it? Well, we don’t know for sure, but we did ask the first aid guy if they have a lot of people get injured on their patios from the floor. He said yes! He said yes! Really? They know his is a problem and do not fix it. At least put a sign up to warn customers. So, other than the occasional unpleasant smell on the patio (I think it depended on which way the wind was blowing) the stay was pretty okay until the last day. Breakfast buffet offers a lot of variety. Though, food at all restaurants on property could only be called mediocre. On our last day, the resort did do a great favor for us by allowing us a late check-our as late as 8pm because our flight wasn’t until midnight. So, they definitely helped us in that way. However, we were disappointed when we found that our water wasn’t working and that a good majority of the villas lost water. The front desk said that the water was being worked on and wouldn’t be working for the next three hours. I understand that problems happen, however shouldn’t they warn guests? Toilets wouldn’t flush and no showers would work. No water. They did offer to take us to another room to go to the bathroom if needed. So, we wait out the water issue and decide to take a shower. The water comes out brown as we turn it on. The water did finally clear up. However, this is certainly not up to Pullman standards. Overall, the stay was equivalent to staying in a regular hotel. Nothing very special. Yes, the rooms are beautiful. Yes, the hotel has fantastic potential! We had WiFi problems throughout the stay. The staff seemed unapologetic with any issues we had while staying. When I asked if I needed to fill out an accident report for what happened, they said only if they need to take me to a hospital. One highlight was the spa. The spa was great. I had a sunburn and did their emerald wrap. It helped heal my burn. The women working there were very caring, understanding, and comforting. I appreciate them greatly. On our next trip, I probably won’t be staying at a Pullman. If I do, I won’t spring for the more expensive room, because I’m not sure if it’s worth it. Other last minute thoughts to add. We found the source of the smell - it comes from a compost pile next to our room for their garden. Pictured below. We were in room 8033. If you can, avoid that room. Also, we found many loose tiles surrounding the pool edge. We found these by leaning our backs against the edge and a tile shifting under the weight. Sadly, I wish we didn’t honeymoon here. They did do a sweet gesture on arrival by decorating our room. But overall the experience left us dissatisfied.

The bedroom itself is luxurious with open concept wardrobe, just right for me. There is even a beach bag prepared in the room to allow us to use. Housekeeping surprises you every evening with different small items for your turndown service. It happened to be Valentine's day on my last evening and I was totally caught unaware of the occasion till I walked to the Tamarind Rst seeing all tables were setup for candlelight dinners. It was very nice of Mr James whom is the General Manager of the hotel to realise I am sitting all alone at the rst on such an ocassion and came over to chat so I do not get too awkward eating alone.

There was so much choice, you could never get bored. The rooms were well equipped and the balconies had lovely beds and chairs outside to relax in private. The food at the aqua restaurant was delicious and entertainment in the evening was a nice to see. The location is by the beach, however the beach is a little disappointing (not the hotels fault!) the tide would go in most of the day so you could walk for miles, and obviously a lot of sea rubbish left behind. There was a small strip of restaurants and shops just 5-10 min walk where you can have food by the ocean and watch the beautiful sunset. There are many people offering tours along here, we took a one day tour to the phi phi islands. The location is perfect if you want to be in total relaxation away from everything. The hotel offered a shuttle to the central Phuket shopping mall (near Phuket town) but this only left at 2pm and pick up at 5:30pm. I’d recommend the hotel adding a few more options as this was constantly fully booked. Also would have been good to have a late option on the weekends, as the mall is very close to the weekend night market. It will help those who want to get out a bit from the hotel to see things! As the location is far from the airport (about 1 hour) a taxi is about 1000 bhat each way. Overall a really fantastic hotel in a very secluded location. If that’s what you are looking for then this hotel is perfect for you. ","February 2, 2019","19    Pullman Phuket Panwa Beach Resort

1102,"I visited the hotel to do a Recce for a wedding client. Was kept waiting for 2 hours before anyone could attend to me.So I resorted to grabbing lunch at the Edge Beach Club. In a nutshell, my experience was quite bad. I ordered for some rice dish with chicken. The chicken was stale. I ordered for a Mojito in their happy hour scheme. The Mojito came with bitter lemon seeds and sugar chunks that weren’t dissolved. The Mojito was average, and I had to request for it to be strained so that I don’t end up eating bitter lemon seeds. I then got up, leaving my bag behind at the table to use the washroom, which was in another part of the hotel. While on my way there, I was rudely stopped by the bartender / cashier to pay my bill. Quite disrespectful considering I informed their team that my bags are at the table and I am just going to use the washroom. While the infrastructure looks great, the experience is quite disappointing. Wouldn’t recommend visiting this place if you are looking for a peaceful good getaway.

1104,"The Pullman Phuket Panwa is definitely not as posh as the Pullman at the Phuket Arcadia National Park. The services are fine, it’s the amenities that are a step down. The entire resort structure is disjointed, meaning you cannot easily get from the lobby to your room, nor the pool, the beach, or the restaurants without going up & down stairs. They’re all in separate buildings that you have to go down the stairs, cross over to another building, to then go back up. It’s weirdly designed. And the beach, the tide goes out at around 11am & doesn’t return until 5pm. The entire day the beach is nothing but silty sand with pockets of garbage on it. And when the water does return, it’s warm & still as piss water. Forget about the water activities, unless you’re an early bird. The pool is nice. They have a swim up bar, which was probably my favorite part of this Pullman. They play good music & the drinks are OK. They have happy hours from 1pm to 3pm at the pool, & 6pm to 9pm at the lobby. The drinks are passable. The food is hit or miss. Do order the satay kebabs at poolside; they grill it right there & it’s delicious when fresh off the grill. The pool can get pretty packed since they can’t really use the beach during the day. The cleanliness of the pool is questionable. There’s a layer of sunscreen scum floating in the corners of the pool entryways that didn’t get skimmed off the whole time we were there. Gross. The beds are comfortable, the room is clean. They’re quite good about changing the sheets daily & not simply remaking the bed for you. The staff is friendly & most accommodating. Lastly, at the Pullman Arcadia they have nightly acoustic guitar man, Jay Acoustic, performing in their lounge. He’s good & he draws a large following. We were looking for similar entertainment here at Pullman Panwa & were disappointed. This Pullman is just OK. I suppose we will end up returning to the other Pullman next time we pass through Phuket.

1105,"After thorough research over several days and browsing through details and customer reviews we finalized Pullman Phuket Panwa Beach Resort to celebrate our 10th marriage anniversary vacation and Pullman did not disappoint us on any front. The room was neat with a large balcony and a great view. The staff were all nice and courteous. The resort has several restaurants with various choices and well-priced menu. There are several options to try out local Thai street food near the resort. We wanted a quiet place far away from the usual hustle and bustle of Phuket and Panwa beach was the perfect place for our requirement. We stayed for 4 days and never did we had any discomfort which wasn't sorted promptly by the staff. If someone is looking for night life, night market etc then Panwa beach is probably not the right place to be.","January 20, 2019","19    Pullman Phuket Panwa Beach Resort

As we were looking for some relaxing vacation this was a very good choice. The hotel is really nice and the friendly staff is always taking care of the location. As we wanted to change the room due to being directly located above the kids club we got a nice upgrade to a pool villa. The breakfast offers a nice variety of food, local and international as well. The beach is quite and nice and welcomes you so spend literally the whole day down here. We just had our booking with breakfast included which proved to be no issue at all as you can find many good small restaurants in the vicinity of the hotel. Also booking some trips is quite easy as there are many offerings in the vicinity as well, directly in front of the hotel Mr. Ben who organized a quite awesome day for us.

1110,"I stayed in a deluxe sea-facing suite and it was an outstanding experience. I'm a frequent Pullman customer, with their hotels being my first choice wherever I go; And this trip validated my choices.As expected, the suite was amazingly well-kept, from the walk-in shower to the hot tub to the view of the ocean and the beach, it was excellent. August was supposed to be monsoon season, but we were fortunate enough to get great, sunny weather.We were also fortunate enough to get high tides during the day, which ensured that we were always able to go kayaking or swimming in the nice waters. The small beach is well-kept and free of garbage. The hotel has a private beach which is inside of a cove, so the waves are very gentle and the waters are ideal for a swim (or kayaking, because they offer kayaks to guests). I happened to wake early one morning and I spotted the staff raking the beach, which was a really nice touch.I'd say that we were most fortunate to have met Ivan. Ivan is the friendliest hotel manager I've had the pleasure of meeting. He ensured that I was getting the most out of my Phuket experience, right from checking in on me during breakfast to answering my questions about the city. Ivan: you bumped this from a 4 star+ review to a solid 5 star review. Thank you for the great experience.Breakfast was really 5 star, best-in-class with significant variety and I attribute this to the fact that they have enough staff to ensure that the food doesn't taste industrially made. The 2 swimming pools are structured as infinity pools, and are beach & ocean facing. Layout-wise, this is top-notch. The staff really really pays attention to the resort amenities to ensure a superior experience. I had a great time. Would strongly recommend for couples or families.","January 7, 2019","19    Pullman Phuket Panwa Beach Resort

1111,"For me this experience At this hotel is very unpleasant. I am here for family holiday with my son and husband I came very sick with a bad flu from my country. That Thai client service is a history they are not at all as caring and friendly as they used to be known as. In the family room we were staying they worked at canalization in the nearby and when entering the room you simply could breath. At 1 I clock in the night we have to find solutions to breath as, again they simply don’t care. I asked at the reception for some medicine to be bought for my strong flu ..,again not possible.I gave them the website to call and ask if something could be bought for us, again no solving.The cleaning service is not good at all. The pool so crowdy that you cannot find a chair if you go there around 10-11. ( and if you are coming from Europe is hard to be there at 8am due to the time difference). For me it is a bad experience I cannot wait to leaving back home. I visited so many countries, I was at so many hotels around the world but this is not the one for me... not even far. If you like to have a nice holiday in Thailand choose another hotel. Less disappointments.... good luck!","January 6, 2019","19    Pullman Phuket Panwa Beach Resort

1112,"We stayed at this resort for 4 days to start the new year. Although the weather wasn’t so good, we really enjoyed our stay and did not get bored! The hotel has clean spacious rooms with beautiful views, the spa is amazing with professional therapists, the food at the two restaurants is good. The resort offers multiple activities: kayak, paddle, thai box (great private class with Matt)! We also did the private cooking class with chef Tum and Oat which was a really nice experience and well organised. On the downside, Pullman , which is part of Accor is taking sustainability absolutely not serious and is only using it as marketing tool rather as trying to make a real impact on the world! This is absolutely unacceptable in 2019 and the company should be ashamed of it. We were really shocked to see that while we are asked in the room to “keep our towels and not change our bed sheets” for sustainability reasons (which we completely agree with), on the other hand the beach is full with waste and plastic. We even asked for bags to help cleaning but were not given any. The staff unfortunately isn’t trained enough or enough in quantity to make sure the beach area is properly cleaned for the plastic waste. Most of waste is also waste which is definitely from the hotel due to the fact that the staff is not cleaning properly after a long day of work. The hotel chain will only create a real impact when it takes environment seriously on all level, not just towels! In general, great stay and we could return but than definitely hope to see that the GM has taken this point seriously. ","January 5, 2019","19    Pullman Phuket Panwa Beach Resort

The only thing that bothered me was no designated area for smoking so it was hard to choose where to sit at the pool.","November 11, 2018","19    Pullman Phuket Panwa Beach Resort

1133,"We stayed in the junior suite for 4 nights, the rooms were big and spacious, however the decor was in need of some updating. The service was mediocre as we had their staff come ringing our doorbell incessantly without even pausing just to pass us their daily tidbits. Geez, we can’t be waiting for you at the door right? Have some patience. The hotel is located in an isolated part of the island so there are limited food options and bars. We chose the Pullman as we read on their website that free shuttle services to phuket town was provided. To our horror, a hotel with a few hundred rooms can only provide a once-a-day shuttle with 13 seats. Absolutely ridiculous! I was told that the next available shuttle bus was 2 days later. This is unacceptable for such a large hotel chain and I do see numerous vans parked in the hotel, so why is it so difficult to make the shuttle services on demand. It is the least the hotel can do, knowing its location is so isolated. And heads up, they leave at 2pm and come back at 530pm, what kind of awkward timing is that? Otherwise, the pool was alright and the food and drinks were bleh. Wouldn’t come back.","November 9, 2018","19    Pullman Phuket Panwa Beach Resort

1134,We visited the Pullman Phuket Arcadia in March and thought it was out of this world in every way. Based on our previous excellent Pullman experience and the consistently good Trip Advisor reviews we decided to try Pullman Panwa Beach. I have to sayI have been somewhat disappointed. The hotel would definitely benefit from a complete refurbishment. Our room was clean and a good size but without any luxury touches expected of a 5 star hotel. The best feature being the sea view. Breakfast is fine with a moderate choice of food but a bit repetitive.As we are not massive breakfast eaters it suited us fine. I cannot comment on any other meals as we prefer to use local restaurants. The pools and garden areas look lovely but on closer inspection realised it needs a good clean and minor repairs attending to.There were cigarette ends arond the sun beds of the landslide pool when we arrived and are still there 10 days later. I have to say the redeeming feature of this hotel is the staff. Everyone we came into contact with has been very helpful friendly and courteous.The hotel is situated in a quiet area which suits our needs. There’s a good selection selection of restaurants opposite the hotel and a lovely little sea front promenade about 10 minutes walk away with more restaurants and a selection of street food stalls. We have enjoyed a lovely restful holiday but are unlikely to return. Personally I would perferr to pay a little extra and benefit from the finesse and true 5 star experience of The Pullman Arcadia.,"November 8, 2018","19    Pullman Phuket Panwa Beach Resort

On the beach just a little walk from the hotel is a outside massage place, which I can highly recommend it was cheaper than the one across the road and it’s on the beachfront, so that is so relaxing and it’s open all the time. The girls there are proper massage therapists and know what they are doing as I had an injury that they worked on for me and helped me so much.The Pullman itself is a very pleasant hotel with beautiful surroundings and very lovely staff.

1141,We’ve stayed in this hotel when it was under Radisson management like a generation ago so I don’t know how the staff or the food are but I still have something to share. The building and the territory itself is very beautiful and well organized. We’ve booked via travel agent the 2nd category of the room but I didn’t like it and we upgraded it to the Radisson suite (Deluxe King suite now). I don’t know maybe I am too picky but every time I found myself in the best rooms available in the property I feel that it need to get more wise interior designer. Maybe because you’re expecting not less than perfection. By the picture now it’s looks better but they change the windows. Back years it looks just an endless sky. Two important things you need to consider choosing this hotel... it’s far from everything in Phuket especially from night life. Literally like one and the half hour by taxi. And because of the tides sometimes it’s NO SEA till the end of the bay. Enjoy exploring in flip flops the bottom. Actually I didn’t have an opportunity to swim for a two weeks we’ve stayed over there because I usually sleep till noon on vacation. For swimming we went to the other hotel on the opposite side of Panwa and Racha island (highly recommend).As my advice choose Pullman Panwa if you would like to stay on Panwa and explore the neighborhood. And wisely check the tides by the season you’re going to come to not to have a beach vacation without enjoying the sea.,"October 28, 2018","19    Pullman Phuket Panwa Beach Resort

1144,"This is a beautiful well cared for property. Our seaview villa was clean and well kept. Unfortunately otherwise the hotel falls short. Dinner service was poor the food luke warm and flavorless. Only 3 staff working and although they did their best had no chance. We had to call or get up every time we needed service. At least 4-5 of the breakfast buffet’s hot dishes empty 45 minutes before 10.30. One poor guy manning the egg station, he had no chance of ever catching up. The pool staff no help my wife and I were instructed to “get our own towels” as they had “work to do” (they were rearranging furniture). On the positive side check in and check out was flawless and although throughout the hotel the staff was obviously short handed they were smiling most of the time. In 4 days I never saw the manager or anyone that appeared to be a supervisor anywhere on the property. Overall I had the feeling that the hotel was managed extremely poorly and the staff have given up. Definately far below Pullman standards.","October 23, 2018","19    Pullman Phuket Panwa Beach Resort

1147,"I really love this hotel.The location is very peaceful. It is very suitable for those who are looking for a calm and serene accommodations on Phuket island.It is far away from the hustle bustle of the Patong beach (about 45 minutes by car).The hotel offers activities for kids and adults on its premise to keep you entertained.I had the pleasure to attend one of the yoga classes conducted by an experienced yoga instructor, Li. It was very nice session indeed.If yoga is not for you, you can also join the beach volleyball or the marine watch when the water is low tide.A short walk from the hotel, you can find restaurants, massage centres and convenience store.One bad experience I had though. I requested for a car to drive me to a local seafood restaurant, Pak Nam Restaurant. On the way there, our driver from Pullman, Chang, recommended that we go to another seafood restaurant, Khun Thai. He said it is better however, we discovered that it is just average and I think we get were over-charged for being tourists who are not familiar with the area. Bad judgement on the driver's part. We welcome recommendations but only if it is a very good recommendation. We are willing to pay for the seafood as long as it is worth what's it''s value. 2 white steamed rice for 50 Baht each and 2 very diluted mango juices for 100 Baht each, you got to be kidding me. Not very happy about this. See more of my reviews on Khun Thai Restaurant.","October 13, 2018","19    Pullman Phuket Panwa Beach Resort

1148,"Staying here was an absolute pleasure, very clean modern hotel in a quieter area in Phuket. Very helpful staff great facilities and lots going on if you wanted to get involved. Alternatively, there are a number of local bars and restaurants which are all within walking distance, and as we stayed here for 5 nights sampled a number of them and wasn’t disappointed in any. There is a handy 7/11 across the road to stock up on snacks by the pool and the usual laundry services along with the many massage and holistic treatments to take advantage of all within a short distance. A short walk will take you to the seafront and a very small shingle beach. Here in the evening locals set up street food carts which provide a large variety of local cuisine and you can take a rug, a bottle of wine and sit and chat the evening away a very chilled way to spend the evening away from all the hustle and bustle like in other parts of Phuket. Panwa is ideal if you want a bit of calmness it’s a one road in and out kind of place - no night clubs or late night entertainment ideal if you have been travelling and just want a bit of down time before going home. The hotel is excellent for families as there is a kids program and because the hotel is directly on the beach great for keeping kids safe. The sea isn’t very deep and is tidal so kids will enjoy the rock pools with an abundance of crabs to investigate. There is a free taxi into the old town for those in need of a shopping fix, this needs to be booked in advance as spaces are limited. Overall this is an excellent hotel and would definitely recommend.","October 12, 2018","19    Pullman Phuket Panwa Beach Resort

We occupied 3 bedrooms.A wonderful hotel with beautiful pools, lovely gardens and is located a short walking distance from the beach.The food at the restaurant is delicious and the staff at the restaurant is amazing. Every evening of the week they serve a new food theme. They also have a couple that sings lovely songs every evening.The rooms are spacious and the house keeping is excellent. Unfortunately the maintenance is not so eager to please guests since our air conditioner was faulty from day one, and they only fixed it on day seven (after I demanded to see the manager). Every day we complain, every day they say it is now fixed...very sad.Then we had this young lady with a “bob” haircut at the front desk that has the habit of talking down to guests. You complain about the air conditioning, she almost sneers at you.When we arranged our booking, we asked for a late check out and it was stipulated on our travel plan. When I discuss this with the lady at the front desk with the “Bob” haircut, she tells us it’s company policy for us to be out at 12:00, and is not interested in on what’s on my booking confirmation. We were told to pay an additional THB1600 for a late check out. At 12:00 when my son and his family had to depart, the front desk manageress comes to me and says they made a mistake, and we don’t have to pay anymore. What a disappointment to have to 1st have to deal with a very unpleasant person at the front desk that speaks down to people, and only then have a very nice and respectful manageress rectify the problem.Unfortunately due to the poor maintenance and disrespectful front desk lady with the bob haircut, it spoilt an wonderful stay at this resort.","June 9, 2019","20    Horizon Karon Beach Resort & Spa

We opted not to pay the extra for this as we liked the proximity of the general accommodation to the two major pools, one with swim up bar.Breakfast was a mix of Asian and Western and exceeded our expectations. Dinner was buffet style with a different theme each night e.g. Monday - Italian, Tuesday - Asian etc. Once again first class choices that exceeded our expectations.

The room was clean but everything could have done with a freshen up as the furniture was chipped and tired looking. The buffet breakfast was average catered for most nationalities, everything apart from the tea and coffee was help yourself which made no sense. If you sat inside you could be waiting 15 mins for them to bring you some coffee but on the evening buffet it’s help yourself? Service was good if you sat outside even better in large groups if your a couple it’s not so good. Due to an emergency with our return flights we needed to use the hotel telephone to make an international call, there were no prices for this in the hotel guide book in the room so we used it once and then checked the room bill the day after and it wasn’t on there so assumed it wasn’t chargeable. After more drama I had to use it again the hotel waited until we had ran up a huge bill to inform us of the price of the calls and threatened us with the police if we didn’t pay it. I complained to multiple managers but just got shouted at why you no check why you no check. But I did when I paid the bill the day before felt like I was absolutely robbed and think this is a scam. We only used it because my partners mobile was stolen in patong and mine didn’t work with the Thai sim in it and our flights were cancelled so we needed to make rearrangements. What annoyed me even more was due to this we had to leave a night early no concession was made for this they didn’t knock a single baht off that bill and just shouted at us. The bar staff at the pool were lovely but the drinks are very expensive for Thailand and they don’t use brand named alcohol which for a “luxury” resort isn’t good enough really. It’s ok for maybe groups of friends wanting a holiday but it’s luxury and unless your spending thousands they don’t seem to give a damn about your experience. Will never stay there again even for free. ","May 23, 2019","20    Horizon Karon Beach Resort & Spa

Very spacious and clean. The meals were varied and excellent. We also enjoyed the afternoon 2 hrs of snacks and drinks in the Club lounge. Anita and the staff were brilliant!When we left, I had not checked the room thoroughly enough and left some items in a drawer in the room. We had moved to Khao Lak by the time I realised and contacted Horizon. They generously forwarded the goods to me at their expense.

1163,"Stayed here for a total of 10 days. In that time was made to feel very welcome. We stayed in the privilege club room, poolside. Well appointed room, large, bright and clean. The privilege club lunches were often fried nibbles; which were half cold by the time they were delivered from the kitchen. Maybe they should look at serving in Bain Marie style servers.The complimentary meal vouchers for dinners and the free breakfasts were a great way of keeping the travel budget in check. Wide variety of food on offer for the buffets,which does get repetitive after the first few days. The pool bar cocktails are tasty and so cheap.The free tuk tuk to and from Karon beach, as well as the free bus to and from Horizon was a great help.Wide variety of shops nearby within easy walking distance. All in all, we had a great time and will return. ","May 17, 2019","20    Horizon Karon Beach Resort & Spa

1168,"We booked to stay at Horizon Karon Beach on the back of TA reviews for 4 nights in April. Overall we were absolutely delighted with our stay and would not hesitate to stay again. The staff are absolutely brilliant and always willing to help with a smile too. Our Privilege Wing pool view room was huge and clean. Indeed, we received a free upgrade without even asking from a garden to pool view room. Our pool was wonderful with plenty of quality and available sunbeds. Breakfast was excellent too. And the Tuk Tuk up/down the hill was very much appreciated and was the free bus to Patong which we used one evening. There is even the lovely touch in reception to welcome guests arriving. The Priviledge Lounge was brilliant too with air con, free drinks and lovely nibbles too. The gardens are beautiful too throughout the entire hotel. The only downside we felt to this hotel is the lack of a bespoke bar to relax in later in the evening. The pool bars close at 8pm (and don’t even open until 11am) and other than the main restaurant there is no where to just have a drink. This seemed to us to be a bizarre set up and the one area the hotel could be improved upon. Yet overall it is a mighty fine hotel indeed. Thank you so much to the entire team for our stay.","April 26, 2019","20    Horizon Karon Beach Resort & Spa

The phone to get lift back up the hill is in a small box same side as the taxis under their shelter, nice people. The pool and staff service was very good. Also used to the transfer to patong was includ e d to the sister hotel so really had best of both location. Rooms were neat and clean and met our needs. Hotel is in a tsunami safe zone for those wondering. The beach at bottom of hill plesant and close enough to walk to. The shops are not too far away with options for shopping and other food places to visit. Tours can be organised though hotel with ease. My son got sick on this trip and The staff couldn't have helped us more if they. I recommend this place to stay, for families and couples has an adult only section for those not wanting to be near those of us with roudy kids.

Worth the extra for adults only area, the pool is clean, gardens very lush.Lots of breakfast option - but can't go past the fluffy freshly made omelettesComplimentary Snacks and local spirits in Privilege Club between 12 - 2 pm - Mane our hostess was delightful, smiley, attentive and remembered our orders. There was a different choice of snack and small deserts and fruit every day.Adult pool perfect size and depth, Ken the barman at pool bar makes fantastic, reasonably priced cocktails. Also friendly and we looked forward to seeing him. Could have more sunbeds under umbrellas in that area, but not a big issue.At night there is a 2 piece band in restaurant at night playing well known favorites. Location - hill is manageable, but the hotel tuk tuk service is available. Close to beautiful, clean , sandy Karon Beach . There are plenty of restaurants, shops etc nearby - not too busy ,and you don't get hassledRooms are clean. Room 2 double beds was big enough for 3 of us but only 2 sun lounges on the balcony. Good value for price paid.NOT FOR YOU IF- limited mobility - resort is quite big and lots of stairs, and there's the hill.

Our room was quite comfortable and very clean. We did notice that part of the fridge was not very clean. The air conditioning worked very well. The room has beach mats and the front desk provides beach towels and beach umbrellas which is convenient. We loved the pools and the swim up bar staff was fantastic!! The drinks were some of the best we have ever had!! Loved the watermelon mojito!! Many thanks to the Bar Captain for such excellent service!! We always found a chair by the pool since you can’t save a pool chair. The staff will remove your towel if you leave the chair unattended for a long period of time. I think this is a great policy!! We always enjoyed lunch by the pool as well, excellent choices! The front desk staff was always helpful and courteous. The concierge was friendly and helpful. We liked the size of the hotel, not too large and not too small. There is a free shuttle into Patong that’s we used twice, but you have to reserve in advance. The beach is a short walk away but the walk back is uphill and it is steep. They have a free tuck tuk if you don’t want to walk. Everything is close by, restaurants and shopping.

1176,"Firstly, apologies to the Hotel and staff for posting this review so late. Looking for accommodation and was scanning through reviews and realised I never posted a review for our stay in December 2016. As they say, better late than never. What a great 10-day stay at Karon Horizon. None of the complaints voiced by a small handful of guests on TripAdvisor. Very efficient and extremely friendly personnel, great service, highly enjoyable breakfasts, comfortable and clean rooms. Great location with a tuk-tuk service up and down the hill, and shuttle services to Patong. We were booked in a top floor room but my wife had some discomfort using the stairs in the Family Section of the hotel due to a knee operation a month prior to our stay. On day three the hotel staff offered to move us to a room on the ground floor, which we gladly accepted. Unfortunately we hardly slept that night due to a couple next door that seemed to noisily unpack throughout the night after their arrival. Probably jet-lag...Anyway, the staff heard us mentioning it at breakfast and we were then offered a room in the no-kids Privilege Club. While this was an unexpected offer, it does not influence my review in any way. We were extremely happy with our stay and can recommend this hotel for families and couples alike. Our sincerest thanks to the hotel and staff.","March 10, 2019","20    Horizon Karon Beach Resort & Spa

1177,"The hubby and I spent 13 nights at the Horizon Karon Beach in October for our first trip to Phuket and couldn’t have asked for a better time. Check-in was simple and quick. We really appreciated the refreshing (delicious!) tea and cool towel after a very long travel day from the States. We were promptly showed to our room with our bags. The room was lovely and the beds comfy. The mini fridge stayed super cold (Caribbean, take note) and was large enough to store all our refreshments, while two complimentary water bottles were provided daily. We never had issues with water pressure or the air conditioning either. Daily Housekeeping was provided by the sweetest ladies, always smiling, ready with fresh towels and toiletries. We also had a lovely view of the pool area and partial ocean view. Since we were celebrating my birthday, they surprised us with a fruit platter and birthday cake in our room as well, so thank you, Guest Services! We had the breakfast buffet included in our vacation package and it was a great start to the day. There’s plenty of food options to suit everyone’s tastes. The hubby enjoyed the American breakfast fare (eggs, toast, cereal), while I dived into the rotation of delicious Thai cuisine. The staff was always friendly and attentive as well.We only spent a couple of days by the pool, but the water was clean and refreshing. Perhaps we went during the slow season, but we never had issues with finding a sun chair. The grounds were also very lush and well maintained. The hotel has a very tropical boutique feel, which we enjoy.One of our favorite things about this hotel is the perfect, centralized location. It is located right across the street from a nice stretch of beach and walking distance to amazing restaurants, shopping, and relaxing massage parlors. If you turn right, you are in Karon Beach. Turn left and you get to explore Kata. We switched it up between both. Full disclosure, the hotel does sit at the top of a steep hill, which isn’t that far of a distance, but in the heat and humidity, whew! It can get tiresome, but it is entirely manageable and a good way to burn off all the food we indulged in ;) During the times we were lugging gallons of drinking water from the mini marts, we would call the front desk from a phone booth at the bottom of the hill and use their complimentary tuk tuk service to get back up to the hotel. As a bonus perk, the hotel offers a complimentary roundtrip shuttle to their sister hotel in Patong Beach, which makes for a fun day trip. Just be sure to reserve your spots in advance as space is limited to a couple of time slots a day. We took the shuttle on 2 separate days and really enjoyed the excursion.Overall, we had an amazing stay and would go back in a heartbeat. If you are looking for a budget friendly hotel with wonderful service in an excellent location, look no further.

We arrived just after midnight to a very smiley welcome from the night manager who processed us in quick time so we could get to bed. Our room was in the deluxe wing and was a very good size with plenty of room to spread out. The resort was wonderful with awesome food at breakfast and my wife really enjoyed the egg station in the morning for the custom made egg dish's. The rep from Tour East was fantastic and set up our Itinerary of trips and attractions for our eight day stay so we were on the go for our whole stay. The staff at the resort were happy and pleasant and nothing was ever a problem. It would be good to have the pools open past 8pm for a post dinner swim but this is only a suggestion as I am sure there is a very good reason for this. We loved the shops in Karon & Kata and were very happy with our purchases. Being transported around Phuket to our various tours in the shuttles was truly an adventure and was definetley a highlight.

1184,"Horizon Karon Beach Resort & SpaOn our arrival the lobby was beautiful with open air fans but it was still stifling hot and we were sweating profusely.There were many seating areas with tables but all the tables were wet and dirty with used glasses and napkins on them.We arrived 2 hours early and the resort was not very busy with customers but they insisted that we wait until the 2:00 check in time. It was 2:20 before they finally took us to our room which they said was an upgrade since our original room was still not ready and we had to wait.The first thing my wife and I noticed was a large, wet brown stain dripping down a shelf onto the bathroom counter. We had to go outside to find the housekeeping lady to clean it up.When I tried to wash my hands I found that the soap dispenser was broken and did not work at all. We had to go out and find the cleaning lady again and she couldn't get it to work either.We returned to the front desk to voice our displeasure but the front desk Manager Kannika was less than helpful. She did not appear to believe that these things actually happened. We asked for an upgrade...and all we got was attitude. She tried to make us feel guilty by saying we already got an upgrade... (Yes, but to a dirty room with a broken soap dispenser!)In the middle of discussions she left us to deal with another unhappy customer and didn’t return for about 30 minutes.By the time we agreed on a compromise to upgrade to the Privelege Club side at a further and higher cost to us it was about 4:30 pm.The Manager got a bellboy to show us to our new room but he did not offer to carry our suitcases. When we got to the room the door key did not work and he had to find a housekeeping lady with a master key.He walked into the room with his shoes on (which is a no no at this resort) and said WE should go back to the lobby to get another key. He then walked out without explaining anything about the room electronics.Oh...did I mention that the sink tap in our new up-upgraded room leaks like a sieve?As well, it turns out that the brown liquid we thought was spilled coffee we found in our first room turned out to be a kind of oil lamp to sweeten the smell in the bathroom. It was all over this counter as well.By the end of the day I was exhausted and laid down on a rock hard king sized bed. The pillows were very large and unforgiving. I woke up every morning with a sore neck and back.The Privilege Club side has a free “Happy Hour” but is only active from 2:00 to 4:00 when most people are out for the day. Also, they don’t serve beer or wine, only cheap hard stuff and you have to make your own drink with available pop, juice or soda.There is a nice enough pool with a swim up bar. With their happy hour you get all of 20 % off your drink!The pool itself is a pretty good size but is in dire need of repair with chunks of concrete broken in many areas.The only bright side to this resort was Ms. Khom who was working in the lounge and restaurant areas. She is a wonderful warm person with a great bubbly personality. The Horizon Group would do well to make her the resort manager!We are absolutely shocked that this is billed as a 4 1/2 Star hotel as it should be a 3 star...and no...we will never return here.","October 30, 2018","20    Horizon Karon Beach Resort & Spa

The room was large and quite good and overlooked the pool, but the water was dirty and uninviting and had a strong sewerage smell nearby. The larger family pool appeared cleaner. Happy Hour 12md - 2pm was a weird time, no wine or beer available, only cheap spirits and a small selection of finger food. Evening meal was very ordinary, buffet style, themed nights, and appeared to be served up for breakfast the next day.. Definitely not 4 star. Probably great for families on a budget.

1187,"This would be the first time I don't recommend a club room. Can't see it as value for money. The complimentary drinks and nibbles come at 12 noon to 2 pm. It's less than 2 hours after breakfast. the snacks are fine but drinks are limited to spirits - no beer or wine. A bit heavy for middle of the day. I understand they probably do this as you can book a dinner package with your room but just didn't work for us. Now some good - we have been to Thailand many times and the check in was exceptional. Don't know if because it was the club room but the reception staff were amazing. The room is reasonable size with a large balcony. Bathroom has a separate rain shower and full size bath. They have done some good with their green policy by dispensing with the little shampoo bottles which is great, however the towels get changed regardless of where you hang them. Staff need training. We only used the adult pool once because the other pools are better especially the one with pool bar. Again staff good. Breakfast is quite good with the usual mix of Asian and western. The themed dinners are ok but there is only a small number of dishes for the theme. I guess that gives people variety. Downside - drinks are expensive. Additionally there is no where to go after dinner. The resort would benefit with a lounge bar and they have the room. Sitting at the dinner tables after your meal is not relaxing. The club lounge closes early at around 8pm so you can't even use that. Others have mentioned the laundry and cheap beer just outside the front entrance. Also a reasonable massage there. Garden and surrounds are pretty. Overall not the best resort we have stayed at but certainly quite good. Even with the separate adults area I think it probably suits families better. Also a lot of steps to pool, reception and restaurant though there is a ramp. We had no trouble getting the courtesy tuk-tuk up the hill. Plenty of dining options on the main road.","October 17, 2018","20    Horizon Karon Beach Resort & Spa

1188,"We recently returned from Thailand, having spend a week at this resort. We booked two rooms, both overlooking the pool area. We specifically requested interleading rooms but old there was no availability on our arrival. Rooms and bathrooms were cleaned daily. Note to future visitors is that lotion is not provided. Shower gel and shampoo are in canisters on the shower wall. Our canisters were almost falling off the wall. Milk is also not provided. You have to make do with creamer. Even though the hotel is rated as 4 star, the decor, furniture, bathroom etc are quite dated. The shower is inside the bathtub. There was sufficient cupboard space, with a safe included. Plug points were faulty. My son had to sleep on a sleeper couch in our room and it was very uncomfortable so he ended up sleeping in our bed. The meal choices were average, drinks were expensive! Pool area is fantastic, you can order drinks etc from a bar inside the pool. We enjoyed the entertainment every night. Staff were just amazing and treated us like royalty. The laundry costs, as in most hotels, is per item. However there is a lady who sits just outside the hotel entrance and charges 60 baht per kg of clothing. Our laundry was ready on item and neatly packaged. The hotel is on a hill so it's a bit of a walk to the beach. A tuk tuk is available to transport guests up and down the hill. From there you can walk to the shops etc. It is extremely humid and once you're don with shopping etc, the walk up the hill is very daunting. You can phone for the tuk tuk but it's not always available so mostly we ended up walking up the hill, to easy when you have kids!! There are also lots of stairs inside the hotel, which might make it difficult for parents with young kids or for older folk. The concierge service was excellent when we needed transport for touring . They are always on time!! The games area was well maintained. We were disappointed that the pool area and entertainment area closed early. Once supper is over there's not much to do. Phuket is an amazing holiday destination but we will most likely change our hotel the next time we visit.","October 12, 2018","20    Horizon Karon Beach Resort & Spa

1190,"There are lots of great reviews and this was why we stayed at the Horizon Karon Beach, but we found a couple of things really let it down for our stay. We stayed in the privilege wing that was for 18 years and over only. The resort is an older Thai style with beautiful gardens. Our room was spacious and kept very clean. The privilege wing came with an executive style lounge with juices, tea and coffee available all day, breakfast cooked to order and a snack style light luncheon. Staff in the lounge were very accommodating. Our accommodation deal came with a buffet dinner - after two nights we decided this wasn't for us as it was mostly large families and the food was aimed at them with very little ""Thai"" available. The themed dinner nights had only a small selection of food changed with the rest of the food a variation of the night before. We found the drinks expensive. Lucky there was a great cheap Thai restaurant at the bottom of the hill and some delicious options a short walk away towards Kata. The family wing had a lovely well maintained pool, but the privilege wing's pool was in poor condition and we watched guests regularly picking leaves and bugs out of the pool. The same leaves stayed around the outside of the pool through out our stay. Lastly the location is up a hill and we found the shuttle tuk tuk provided  by the resort to bring guests up and down the hill almost non existent during out stay. The hill wouldn't normally be an issue, except for the energy zapping heat and sun. The big question: Would we stay again.....sadly no, mostly because of the condition of the pool in the privilege area.","October 5, 2018","20    Horizon Karon Beach Resort & Spa

The friendly staff are really a cut above. Their hospitality is superb and definitely top class. The hotel itself is not very modern but to me that’s not what the experience is all about. We usually consider the quality of our trip based on the opinion of our kids and they only have good things to say.

1192,"Just returned from a 5 night stay at the Horizon Karon, wish we were still there the gardens were stunning!Stayed in a superior room with 2 queen beds with a pool view and balcony, room was clean and had everything you need. Only negative was very hard beds and lots of steps around the resort so not good if you have trouble walking.Breakfast and dinner was included with our stay, buffet was amazing! So many dishes to choose from and varied everyday, atmosphere was great too.Swimming pools were the perfect temperature with large amount of sun lounges, swim up bar a bonus.We took advantage of the free shuttle service to Patong running from 1pm, the is also a free service to the bottom of the hill but didn't use as the hill isn't steep at all. Just outside the resort is a massage shop, prices are excellent and staff so friendly and do amazing massages so need to go down to the main street. If you are looking for a quiet resort to relax in this is the one, can't wait to go back. 10/10","September 12, 2018","20    Horizon Karon Beach Resort & Spa

It was so worth it as you have your own pool, lunchtime snacks and complementary coffee, water etc during the day plus books to read and somewhere quiet to relax anytime during the day. Between 12 and 2 pm you also get free alcoholic drinks. There is also happy hour at the pool and the pool is lovely and large with shady bits also. The breakfast is so varied and lovely and so is the dinner, we had a lovely couple singing most nights and then on Tuesday nights there was Thai dancing. Its hard to drag yourself out of this lovely resort. A swedish massage at the spa within the hotel was sheer bliss. Lovely friendly staff also.

The complimentary tea/coffee, juice, lunch snacks and happy hour in this wings privilege lounge is wonderful as is the happy hour poolside, where the cocktails are amazing. The rooms, grounds, pools are all very clean, can not speak more highly of this place, can recommend 100%. I will be back again !!!!

Not for the mobility challenged because there are a lot of stairs and the property lies at the top of a hill, just up from Karon beach. There are a lot of shops an restaurants near by. The breakfast buffet at the property was good. All in all decent stay but the rooms on the family side were a little cramped for a family of four.

1203,"We booked this hotel for a bargain price ($67AUD per room) via the wonderful people at Travelonline (if you haven't ever checked them out, do it!). For that we had breakfast and dinner included. Given the price and inclusions, even though the photos looked great, my expectations were reasonably low. They didn't need to be.Check in was simple, the staff were super helpful and took us to our room and gave us a very detailed tour. Breakfast is amazing and there was never a problem with the amount or range of food, or the patrons there.The free dinners I had no intention of using, I rightly or wrongly look down on people that eat in the hotel, get out and experience the local cuisine. First night we arrived late and dinner was still going so we decided to give it a go. It was incredible and the Bain Maries keep the food super, super hot - perfect for the paranoid people who don't want to get sick. The food was so good, we ended up eating there every single night and were not disappointed once. The pools are good, the water temperature is perfect (often they are cold, not this one) and the pool bar staff were plentiful, friendly and helpful. The only pain was the pool is 1.5m depth the whole way, no shallow end and we had a couple of 'vertically challenged' people who couldn't reach the bottom to stand! The kids pool was good, though very shallow, something in the middle would be good, but still, absolutely no complaints there. Happy Hour goes for 3 hours and we sampled a few drinks during this time, the cocktails are cheap but the days of 2 for 1 cocktails is gone, so expect to pay 150 Baht, still cheap, but not as cheap as they once were (this seems to be Phuket wide as they attempt to embrace responsible alcohol service).All of the staff were super friendly and the tropical feel of the resort was incredible. It's feels like you're in the middle of nowhere, but you've got everything you need nearby. There are some good cheap restaurants nearby for lunches and just up the road you'll find the Bamboo Bar - 99 Baht cocktails and they'll let you control the music, I highly recommend it!The free tuk tuk up and down the hill was super useful too, it's not a huge hill but when it's so hot and humid, it's nice to be able to get a free lift up and down the hill. Maybe we were lucky, but the other guests at the hotel all seemed friendly - no drunken Aussie bogans in site. We were in the family wing and we loved it.Rooms are clean and though no brand new, have everything you need.We loved our time there so much, we are already planning a return visit. I've stayed in way too many hotels and resorts in Phuket, and this is just about my favourite (I did have a lovely kid free stay at the Amari which will be hard to top, but does cost at least 4 times as much!).There were some negative reviews about this place here, so I was a bit concerned, I have no idea what people could possibly base a negative review on...this place is amazing.","July 28, 2018","20    Horizon Karon Beach Resort & Spa

1204,"We recently stayed at this hotel and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. We had a massive, spacious room in the Privilege Section that leads you right into the lovely pool. The staff were friendly, kind and efficient. The check in at reception was quick as well as the check-out. The breakfasts and dinners were both delicious and offered a good variety. The hotel was on top of a hill and there was a regular free tuk-tuk service to the beach. The hotel also offered a free shuttle service to Pathong Beach about 20 minutes away. . the latter is very busy and exciting but for older couples it is better to stay at Karon Beach where it is quieter and serene. There are also plenty of restaurants in the vicinity of the hotel.However, I will recommend that the hotel have its own shuttle service to the airport especially in case of emergency.

1207,"Terrible doesn't even do this hotel justice. After having two great stays in Bangkok and Chiang Mai, Thavorn Beach Village Resort & Spa completely ruined the end of a great trip. Through a helpless management staff, dirty rooms, and a food-poisonous-causing breakfast buffet, it's safe to say this is the worst hotel I have ever stayed at. Reasons are below:1) First off, as soon as we arrived, they greeted us with a warm DOUBLE BOOKING and failed to contact us before we arrived. I want to make it clear that we were in active contact with Thavorn's management team weeks and weeks before arrival, but not once did they let us know that they had two reservations under my name. Despite the fact this was not my fault, they said the situation was out of their hands and they were unable to do anything but charge us double for our hotel room. The manager, Rose, handled the situation horribly and unprofessionally. It was clear this hotel had no idea how to run a business. On top of this, they didn't have our room ready until an hour after check-in time, so they threw us in a ""VIP Lounge"" that was the equivalent to a jail cell for guests that didn't have their room ready. It was boiling hot, crowded with distressed families, and they gave us two pieces of bread with mayonnaise, also known as their ""complimentary sandwiches.""*Also, in the hotel lobby prior to checkin, I overheard unhappy guests complain about brown water coming from their faucets - YUCK!2) As they lead us to our room AN HOUR past checkin time, there was dirty laundry and crumbs all over our front porch from the previous guests. You can tell they were scrambling at the last second to finish up our room. We also purchased the romantic package and were not greeted by the chocolate bouquet as promised -- we had to remind them two days after.3) AVOID THE BREAKFAST BUFFET AT ALL COSTS. Eating all types of exotic foods throughout Thailand, I would never expect the hotel breakfast buffet to make me sick for my entire last day. I highly recommend to not have the breakfast at the hotel, you're better off eating in Patong.Don't let their private beach fool you, there's a reason Thavorn barely squeezed a 4 star rating. If you're trying to have a pleasant stay in Phuket, definitely go with a different hotel.","July 11, 2019","21    Thavorn Beach Village Resort & Spa

1208,"!!! READ BEFORE BOOKING !!! The WORST hotel I've ever stayed in - wish I could give it a zero star rating. Here's why: when checking in, we were kept waiting for an absurdly long amount of time in the lobby, only to eventually be brought into a ""VIP waiting room"" that was beyond disgusting. This room was basically a hot, loud, dirty holding cell for people to wait in when management didn't have their rooms ready past the designated check in time. There were stains on the seats, dirt on the floor, and children running around screaming. After waiting for over an hour for our room to be ready, we finally were told to grab our luggage they had taken from us and to follow them to the room. This was the point where we realized our luggage had been lost by the front desk staff, who then frantically searched everywhere to locate our luggage that they had failed to tag. After they finally managed to find our belongings, they took us to our room, where we immediately noticed there was someone else's dirty sheets and towels on our front porch, and hair scattered all over the floor. We had purchased a romantic package, and the chocolates promise upon arrival were not there as well. It was very obvious they had scrambled to get our room ready and hardly cleaned it since the last residents - GROSS. To make matters even worse we found out upon check in that the resort for whatever reason had two reservations under our name, and that we would be required to pay for both rooms, even though this was not our fault. They came up with some ridiculous excuse and blamed it on policy that was out of their hands. I will never understand why the hotel did not have the decency to contact us prior to arrival about this - considering the double reservation would have been in their computer system for several months. They were very rude about the entire situation, and the manager, Rose, essentially shrugged and told us there was nothing we could do and that we had to pay for 2 hotel rooms. Despite how frustrating this situation was, the hotel did NOTHING to help us, and didn't even have the courtesy to throw in a complimentary dinner or bottle of wine - something that would have cost them essentially nothing. I have never experienced worse hotel management in my life. Take my word for it and DO NOT BOOK THIS HOTEL!!!","July 11, 2019","21    Thavorn Beach Village Resort & Spa

One of the best things I liked are the big and little statues of various animals & legends placed throughout the resort...it gives the place an otherworldly feel! I stayed there for 4 nights and still felt that wasn't enough to explore the place. I hadn't even gone out of the resort for two days!

Airport pick up and drop off was excellent, checking in was excellent, and if you book direct this is complementary for 7 day stay , 5 day gets you pick up only , also you get free Lounge access , small air con room with cold drinks and sandwiches and snacks , this was taken advantage of by some guest who I saw take out of the room on a daily basis vast amounts of drink and food .We had a 5th floor ocean facing apartment, which was accessible by a cable car , I personally walked up the 200 stairs 3 times a day , my wife choose the car , after 1000 pm you either walk or call for the hotel car .The apartment was clean and spacious with a lovely balcony looking out to the ocean , the apartment is some what outdated and the shower etc needs modernisation .Crocodile bar and Melisa restaurant have great food and the breakfast is fantastic, the chefs are really amazing and will cook you anything , I simply cannot fault the food , food prices are ok , but the drinks are expensive 180 -200 + tax for a tin of Chang 40 -60 in Patong , although they have happy hours at both that reduce the price by half at certain times .The resort itself is really the Diamond, private beach a free shuttle service to Patong at various times , we went on tours and I must say they were fantastic and well worth the money , the hotel have a special deal where you pay money up front and they give you money for free , so we spent 7000 bht up front and they gave us 1500 free then we topped up 5000 bht and they gave us 1000 free so well worth it .The greatest assets of this resort is the staff , everyone of them from drivers, gardeners waitress , waiters , cable car operators were absolutely fantastic, I cannot express enough how kind and welcoming they were , I saw managers deal with awkward customers professional and always with a smile , I hope senior managers and owners of this resort appreciate what the staff actually do .So a big thank you to all staff for making our 7 night stay so special .","July 8, 2019","21    Thavorn Beach Village Resort & Spa

Shuttle service from Paying beach is also scheduled almost every two hours. One day whilst we were waiting for the shuttle bus but none appeared, hotel reimbursed us for taxi.

1220,"I stayed here for a week as part of an on property wedding. Last year I stayed in the Renaissance & Amari in Phuket so compared to those hotels this is a significant step down. The rooms while big needed a renewal across the board. The F&B is very expensive with limited options and taste is only average at best. The biggest difference I noticed though was the staffing level was not on par with those other two hotels which leads to a lower level of customer service.The best part of the resort without question is the pool which is massive. However it would be nice if it had a pool bar. Transport cost to Patong Beach is about 300 THB. Unfortunately Phuket's transport prices are about 2 to 3 times that of Bangkok so this ""complaint"" is not limited to this hotel as it is Phuket wide","June 29, 2019","21    Thavorn Beach Village Resort & Spa

1222,"Gorgeous property with lovely gardens, traditional thai buildings and sculptures, and a lot of character. Furniture and bathroom was beautiful and bed was two large double beds joined together. We got upgraded to a lagoon pool access-room when we arrived (probably because it was low season) and the balcony opens right into the pool which is a nice touch! But the food options on the resort were a little expensive (especially the Marisa restaurant) with not many vegetarian options. beachfront Crocodile bar was great pizza with bean bags in front of the beach which was nice. On site snorkelling was nice to see fish eating the coral, but we had to go at a specific time (high tide), wait for the waves to be less choppy even within that time window, as well as go to a specific pocket of rocks to have any visibility or see any fish. Spa was crazy expensive so didn't bother going - went in Patong instead. Getting to Patong was not easy as others have said despite the short distance (v specific and infrequent shuttle times - they cancelled the 8:30pm shuttle which others seem to have used) and there are no shuttles to Phuket town. Breakfast was amazing. Lovely surprise tortoise and orange birds brought out on the grounds.

1229,It's a beautiful property with lots of greenery. If you want to relax nd enjoy this is the place. But carry your after mosquito bite cream for that itching nd as mosquito repellent they give even spray but still because of greenery there are mosquitoes. Or try wearing full clothes during evenings or while taking a stroll in resort gardens. Only thing which I didn't like is they keep condoms in rooms but when I asked for sanitary napkin receptionist said that I need to go to market to buy which I tell you is 15 minute ride from this place. Can you beat that. Except this it's good rooms are pretty good. Beds are comfortable. Bathrooms are big. Even have a tub in balcony. Hill rooms I like more as compared to beach side as you come and go with cable car. Nd it's a ride in itself. You enjoy it. So I would say you should stay here especially with family.

Secondly, they have even assisted us to our room and gave us a brief introduction inside as well, which is great to know! Thirdly, they even have a direct island activities wherein you can get an advice on what you should do during the stay here in phuket and I want to mention Ms. Kim and Ms. Sinead for assisting me and my family and recommending us on what are the best places for a city tour!

From the the garden and maintenance staff, to housekeeping, restaurant/s, pool and check in staff, they were all so welcoming, helpful and friendly.

In particular, we loved the Resort's beautiful live in animals. Pea hens, chickens, roosters, tortoises and birds.Overall, the resort is lovely, but the only suggestion is that the rooms need a little bit of freshening up and the balcony doors need to close fully so that mosquitoes do not come into the rooms.

Was our 9th staff at the resort.Both myself and my wife had a 60 minute massage at the award winning spa onsite and after wards we both felt relaxed and ready for the day ahead. This is something everyone should try.Another highlight was the candle lit"" Romantic Dinner"" under a cabana on the beach looking over the sea to Patong. The personel service & food ""surf & turf"" was just what we expected and a must for anyone to try whilst staying at the resort.The food and breakfast and dinner at MARRISA restaurant was reasonabley priced and great options and pleasure eating. The staff were always welcoming you when you enteted and when leaving adding have a nice day. Special mention to staff - Toh & Jacerra & Bau (tall volley ball player. Hope I have the names right.Check in and check out was painless with caring staff to greet you. Special thanks to Kim & Sia & Oil for making our stay one to remember. House keeping also did a great job with the daily cleaning of our room. Staff at the crocodile bar @ happy hour made us both feel very welcome.Overall we had a most enjoyable vacation and wonderful stay at the resort. The grounds are looking even better this year a credit to to the ground staff.Ongoing work is underway with updating the beach bungalows which will better showcase that area near the beach.We will definitely be back next year or sooner as Thavorn is our home away from home.Chris & Debbie Blair","May 26, 2019","21    Thavorn Beach Village Resort & Spa

1255,"This village resort is not like your usual 5 star hotel. It’s ethos is being at one with nature. The 40 acres are planted with age old frangipani trees & is lush with tropical growth. It is maintained meticulously by an army of gardeners. It is tranquil, glorious & brings peace to your soul. The staff are welcoming & amazing. Always smiling. The rooms - Thai villas - want for nothing. Whatever you request is provided. We have visited Phuket twice & would not, could not dream of staying anywhere else. The lagoon pool is stunning, exactly as the photos show. The village has its own location on private Nakalay Bay which has a healthy reef, the coral maintained & repaired by this resort in conjunction with the Department of Marine & Coastal Resources. If you want to stay in a truly unique Thai owned & themed beautiful natural village, as opposed to the usual hotel, stay here. You will never regret it. By the way, I have read on this forum, some very critical reviews. All I can say is - those writers must be deeply unhappy people. This resort is unique, beautiful & staffed by charming & welcoming employees who treat you with care & respect. I witnessed on two occasions staff members being treated with rude disdain by ignorant guests & felt ashamed that such delightful staff should be subject to such wilful discourtesy.","May 20, 2019","21    Thavorn Beach Village Resort & Spa

1259,"Myself along with other friends have visited this hotel for the pool frequently for the last couple of months and have always spent over the minimum spend (400 bhat, per bed, per person) We had a query with our final bill On our last visit and questioned it with one of the friendly members of staff, she had gone back to her manager and came back to say nothing could be done about it (even though it was wrong) We asked to speak to the manager as our bill was way over £100 and a couple of minutes later MRS KHAN ( the pool & restaurant manager ) approached our sunbeds. No greeting, no asking what the problem was and was EXTREMELY RUDE, she had the biggest attitude. She raised her voice in front of all of the other guests at the pool and started the conversation with ‘you HAVE to pay this bill, I will not change it, this is what you have’ This is embarrassing & humiliating, especially in front of other guests. We told her we will not pay the extra £10 and that was final. Her response ‘ IM CALLING THE POLICE TO COME TO YOU NOW’ - she then stormed off, again in a rude and unpleasant manner. This was not the first time she was rude to us and last time we were happy to bite our tounge, but as we were loyal customers who always spend a lot of money here, it is completely unacceptable to be shouted out and threatened with the police whilst on holiday. We will never return for your custom again, MRS KHAN, you are a disgrace to the Serenity hotel.

Location: okay... but nothing special. The deluxe room I booked, overlooked a construction site. Hotel was almost empty.... in my experience, you move the guests to a similar room, or upgrade them. No privacy.Pool and bar area was closed to all guests, for a wedding. We were told the pool will be closed between 17:00 and 19:00. We were asked to leave the pool area at 16:00 already. At 19:00, we wanted to swim, and we were told it was stilled closed. It was only then pointed out to us that the pool closes at 19:00 every night. The rude Manager on duty said with attitude: ""read the pool rules"". Well, these rules are on a small signage board and impossible to read, as it is blocked by shrubs... Point is, the night before, guests were swimming till around 21:30.Breakfast...below average and basic.Lunch/dinner...average at best. Drinks..obviously overpriced as expected. Staff...rude with terrible attitudes. Stay away.

1272,"This place is incredible. So it’s far from the airport and doesn’t look like much from the outside, but it is stunning inside. Splurge for the suites with the private pool. It’s worth it! In the morning you can see the sunrise from the rooftop and it is truly breathtaking. The restaurant and hotel pool are both lovely as well, and the staff was very friendly and helpful. The breakfast buffet was very good. The front desk staff was also great, they helped organise a tour for us with very short notice. Also, the buggy driver was very personable. It was great to have a buggy take us to the restaurant everyday from the main building. We felt very fancy!The only possible downsides are the location- far from the action of Patong, and the limited room service menu- even though the food is still delicious. Also there are several cats walking around the property. Not ideal for those with cat allergies. I noticed them walking through the restaurant, underneath the buffet tables at breakfast, and at one point, one even sat outside our room purring. I’m not a cat person, so it was very uncomfortable for me.We had a great stay and would definitely consider staying there again on our next trip to Phuket!","February 15, 2019","22    Serenity Resort & Residences Phuket

We had to leave the hotel at 04:00 am as per our flight schedule and when we were about to leave the hotel front desk official, to our surprise, gave us packed dry breakfast for all of us which included few bakery items, packed milk, juice and fruits.

If we can be critical the room did smell a little musty but lots of rooms do in Thailand due to the tropical climate so that did not bother us. Our friends had one of the 2 bedroom suites and it was amazing, we stayed in the normal hotel room, not much of a view from from the room but we were outside near the pool most of the time anyway!

1277,I recently stayed here with my Partner in the Serenity room. Initially we were given a ground floor room (no balcony) however it was very stuffy and smelt like Mildew so we requested another room. We were placed on the 2nd floor the room was much smaller but had a balcony as fresh air is required in these rooms as they are outdated and old. If staying here you would need to look at one of the more expensive rooms. Wouldn't recommend the normal Serenity room. The pool area is very nice i would rate it 3/5 (I have stayed at a lot of 5 star resorts such as the W Koh Samui and Hotel Xcaret in Mexico) so i have high standard for what i would call 5 star. Pool staff are not very attentive...you need to find them to order drinks/food as they are usually standing around on their phones. They dont come around and ask if you would like a drink/food. Again something i would expect from a 5 start resort. You cannot swim at the beach that the property is located on...so what is the point? I wouldn't stay here again or really recommend to people! You can find much nicer hotels in Phuket that are a lot closer to a beach you can swim in! Nai Harn or Kata beach. Nice view of ocean over the pool and sunset though :) Rawai taxi service are expensive set prices so would recommend hiring a scooter or motorbike to get around. Otherwise you will be spending $50 for transport return from beaches etc. On a plus side we were given late check out 2pm which was great as our flight was later that evening.Free bicycle hire which was great! Maid service / room clean was improved once tips of 20 - 50 Baht were left on the bed. Food was nice at the pool restaurant but was triple the price of any other place close by. I traveled to attend AKA Thailand training camp so lucky didn't spend too much time in the room! It would be a nice place to stay if you are expecting 2/3 star :),"January 13, 2019","22    Serenity Resort & Residences Phuket

1278,"We stayed here over Christmas and New Years. We stayed in a ground floor 1 bedroom apartment. The apartment is modern, and large with most features that you will need. We stayed here 6 years ago and returned again to relive our experience. It was a nice, comfortable stay. Friendly staff, generally clean, good pool, okay variety of breakfast. Our experience wasn't as good as it was 6 years ago, but maybe that's because we are now very experienced travellers and our expectations are higher. Some things that need improvement. Housekeeping was okay, balcony / terrace was not cleaned daily, we had to request extra towels daily, would be good if the housekeeping team simply replaced the amount of towels they removed everyday, it was hassle and a bit of a wait requesting towels every day, but not a big deal. With a gorgeous kitchen to use at your disposal it would be great if little touches were made, like a hand towel, surface sponge and hand soap were available in the kitchen, this would improve the facility. When we arrived the apartment bathroom was full of mosquitoes, I assume because the AC was off and a window was open? This was annoying, it took several days to have a mosquito-free bathroom, especially problematic with our 2 year old and anxious about the bites. But I guess the only way to solve this to have the AC turned on in advance of the check in and close the window. The resort does not have any trash can around, except for the room, so after a day at pool you end up taking back lots of rubbish with you. Towards the end of the stay we learnt that this was somewhat intentional to avoid insects etc, this made sense, but I think this should be part of the briefing when you arrive, we found it frustrating that we couldn't find a trash can when we needed one, and you can't always go back to your room to empty rubbish, especially if you are towards the front of the hotel, it's a bit of a trek. Obviously having a kids you end up accumulating a lot of rubbish, so would be better to at least have one trash can by the pool, and look at different ways this could be implemented rather than not having one altogether. Overall good stay. Nai harn beach was not what we remember it to be like, a tranquil spot, it's now overun with tourists and merchants. We found it too busy and not enough umbrellas available for the demand. Definitely try nangnam restaurant across the road from the hotel, best Thai food I've ever had. And if you have kids go to the Rawai park, you won't regret it. ","January 9, 2019","22    Serenity Resort & Residences Phuket

Will definitely be back sometime again. Thank you to everyone at serenity, I miss you all.","November 22, 2018","22    Serenity Resort & Residences Phuket

1284,"We had booked the 2 bedder penthouse suite for a bachelorette weekend. The check-in staff and the buggy drivers were amazing, super friendly and helpful. They were very happy to help us take group pictures, always smiling and accommodating. Our penthouse suite was spacious, with an incredible view of the sea and its surrounding islands. However, the lighting (especially in the bedrooms) can be brighter as it was not ideal when we were trying to put our make up on. Also, there could be a plug near the vanity table for us to use the hairdryer. The breakfast spread was decent. We love the fact that we can make our own juice. Pancake station was interesting but could be a little faster. We loved the rice in chicken soup dish that was available on a daily basis. We loved chilling on the sunbeds that were placed right above the beach which meant we could listen to the waves crashing while suntanning. We wanted to go to the Atmanja spa next door but we were told that we had to book a day ahead so ended up settling for the in-house massages. Two of us had a 90 mins massage in the room while the other two were in the massage room. There was a bit of miscommunication as the receptionist told us that they would bring down the sunbeds from our roof for the in-room massages. However, the masseurs had set up the sofa instead which would not have fitted both of us. I ended up personally bringing the sunbeds down myself which prompted them to help me. The aromatherapy massages were very good all around. To get into Old Phuket town where the night market and restaurants are, this location was not the best as traffic was horrendous. We were stuck in traffic jams of up to 2.5 hours on the way up. Traffic on the other side heading back, was a lot better. Unfortunately, our otherwise idyllic trip was marred by a room service incident. We had ordered pad thai and mid-way through our meal, we found an insect in the crushed peanut. After speaking to 3 people, we finally managed to get hold of someone who could understand English, leading to our meal being waived off by the Management.","November 11, 2018","22    Serenity Resort & Residences Phuket

1285,I was invited to a friends wedding in Phuket so we decided to take advantage a package we had bid on at a golf day auction.What a pleasant surprise from the front it just looked like a hotel but as you move through the resort is front right on to the beach with a beautiful vista of island in the distance framed by sailing vessels.The standout was the food possible the best buffet breakfast I have enjoyed in Thailand. The staff were very well trained and all spoke excellent English much better than my broken Thai.From cocktails to tasty salads the menu catered for the fussiest of eaters. We had booked the grand sea view villa but as we were staying some extra days in rooms that were in block B. My advice invest the extra and get the Sea View Villas as they are divine and the view alone was worth it.Rawai Beach village is a little quiet so we venture to Cape Panwa for lunch one day and it was awesome.I recommend checking the prices online then ringing the hotel direct as they will negotiate.,"October 31, 2018","22    Serenity Resort & Residences Phuket

1292,"This is a beautiful place. I don’t have complaints about the cleanliness at all. I had the grand sea view which had a pretty good view. While I wouldn’t say the was obstructed, my main view was actually the pool and restaurant. For your reference, I stayed on the third floor. Also, the shelter outside isn’t really a shelter, it has holes so when it rains, the seats and tables will be drenched. I wanted to sit outside to read and enjoy the rainy weather so was a little disappointed when I realised that the shelter was not really a shelter. But it is not a big issue.All staff are very polite and always smiling :) We had their in-room dining twice and were very satisfied each time. The chicken with egg noodles was delicious and so is the green curry chicken. Their breakfast spread doesn’t have a big variety, a very small portion of Asian food, more Western food like bread, salads, sausages. I liked the omelette station and my husband praised the coffee. The sea view at breakfast is wonderful and peaceful. Convenience wise, there are several cafes/restaurants just down and up the road. I would say this is the pro and con for me. I personally find it a little dangerous as there is no proper pavement so we have to walk on the road and keep really close to the side as cars/bikes can be fast there. Families with kids may like to note this if you intend to walk up and down the area. There is a big convenience store right opposite. You can find most of your necessities there.We rented a car right opposite the hotel, you can rent scooters too. Cars are about 900baht for a day (note that there is a 5000baht deposit. But you can try to bargain a little). Scooters are around 300baht with 2000baht depositOverall, we enjoyed our stay there :)","October 8, 2018","22    Serenity Resort & Residences Phuket

1293,"I had 5 days in Phuket and mainly went there for diving but also wanted to spend some relaxed days in between. I arrived at 2am and somehow missed to book a day earlier. The hotel staff was super friendly at 2am in the morning. they gave me a room for the few hours until my “officially booked” room was available. All the staff in the hotel were very friendly and paid a lot of attention!Breakfast has a great variety of food options and the lunch and dinner menue offers local and international food. There is also a great selection of vegan and vegetarian meals. the rooms are very clean and the hotel has a nice pool and restaurant area. When i checked out on Wednesday i was able to spend the whole day at the pool as my flight was at midnight. The staff asked me if i would like to have a shower and refresh before i head to the airport and they gave me a room where i could refresh myself. This is GREAT SERVICE I never had in a hotel before. One thing to keep in mind is that there is really nothing around the hotel. so if you like to try out different restaurants you either need a scooter, walk a while or take a cab. But that’s ok. You can also take a nice stroll along the beach down to Chalong. All in all i really recommend the place for some quiet time, great view over the ocean, super friendly staff and great service!","October 3, 2018","22    Serenity Resort & Residences Phuket

Especially like the fruit juice maker!The hotel is equipped with small areas for the toddler. A trampoline, small soccer field and a designated 0.55m swimming corner. My kids love it.

1296,"My boyfriend and I stayed here for 2 nights on our way to the nearby islands after a long haul flight from Canada. We stayed in the Pool Suite Sea View. It was a beautiful suite. The private pool was amazing. Luckily there were no guests on either side, otherwise it would not have been as private. We preferred this for swimming as the hotel pool was pretty crowded even though the resort was not. The beach is not for swimming, the tide was out for most of the day, the free kayaks were a nice touch if you were able to get out early enough. Food was average and overpriced. Breakfast was good. The only major downside is there is not much nearby and if you want to get a cab anywhere it’ll cost you. Traffic is a nightmare. The construction on the main road outside the hotel has been going on for a few years and looks nowhere near complete. We ended up paying close to 3000 Baht for 3 trips to restaurants and the big Buddha. Wish we had stayed on the west side of Phuket as our trip to dinner over there opened our eyes to what we were missing a walk out the door instead of an expensive hour long cab ride. Also checkout is a bit of a long process. Leave yourself some time. Overall nice hotel, bad location.","September 22, 2018","22    Serenity Resort & Residences Phuket

If you want to experience the real beauty of the hotel, choose rooms in front of the beach with private pool If you want to maximise your time in Phuket and enjoy night life, choose a hotel in Patong instead.

1299,"We stayed in one of the private pool suites further up from the beach, and had an amazing time during our 2 week stay. It’s in a quieter area of Phuket away from the hustle and bustle of Patong, which was just what we were looking for. Just about an hour drive from the airport depending on traffic. They provide complimentary shuttle services to Jungceylon in Patong and Nai Harn beach, which is awesome because it saves you a good amount on transportation costs. There is also a local taxi service right next to the hotel which they can call for you if you decide to venture out on your own (prices are pretty standard). Some small shops and a 7/11 are across the street.All of the staff are so friendly and helpful- we were particularly pleased with Joy, Nicky and Pearl just to name a few. They were all so kind and eager to help or answer any questions. We were also particularly thankful that their English was so good. The wait staff at the restaurant was also great. The food selection at the restaurant was nice and the food did not disappoint! Room service was always really prompt too.The hotel and surrounding area is well maintained, and we frequently saw maintenance and gardeners working on things. There are plenty of amenities to take advantage of including the spa, bar and restaurant, and there is a kayak available to use.

As I booked with Agoda I dropped them an email as they should have notified us of any changes.... within 10 mins the Hotel Manager was on the phone to upgrade us to a room with a Pool. It was a much appreciated.Apart from the Hotels restaurants there are only 5 other restaurants in walking distance of the hotel and Mai Khao Town.is around 2km walk which I was aware of before booking as I wanted a peaceful break this time...

Just a few hotel guests to share the kilometres of beach space. Sand is grainy, not the fine type. Waves are big and too strong for swimming but my kids enjoy getting splashed by them.Food:Several food options. 2 restaurants in the hotel and 4 family-run restaurants within 100 metres outside the hotel. We found the hotel restaurants quite decent and kids eat free. The family run restaurants outside are nice and we ate out every night.You can always hire a van from the hotel to head to restaurants further away.Rooms:This is where i deducted a star. I was locked out of my room twice and the 2nd time, no apologies were given. The first time, the staff said that they can only give me one key card. They said my request for a 2nd key card caused both cards to deactivate. What's odd was that my friend had 2 key cards that worked. But I didn't want to argue.But seriously, don't create excuses if you're too lazy to solve it.It happened again a few days later and created some inconvenience. Pls update your system.Otherwise, the rooms were decent and felt clean.Facilities:Lots of similar facilities to other resorts but the outdoor game equipment and kids stuff are really worn out.Spa was great. Good service.Kids club was all right and staff provides art & craft activities for the kids.Small minimart within the hotel but there's a nicer, cheaper one just outside.Staff:Excellent staff. Polite, passable English and cheerful. Very satisfied with most interactions. Except for the lame excuse for why my key cards don't work.Overall, a pleasant stay but won't be coming back for a while until they spruce it up.Kudos to the staff who helped made the trip mostly enjoyable.","June 23, 2019","23    Holiday Inn Resort Phuket Mai Khao Beach

1316,"Mai Khao Beach Resort offers another type of experience as compared to Holiday Inn Patong Beach. The area is relatively quieter and more conducive for a relaxing holiday experience. Positives:- Kids eat free - Kids club is quite well maintained- Clean beach- Arrangement of transport and shuttle services (Staff were able to arrange for round-trip to city and places to eat.)- Staff were generally quite friendly- Offered service recovery options when we did not get to enjoy the Teppanyaki for the Japanese buffet night. Negatives:- Dead insects along the corridors- Sticky feeling on the floors in Family Suite 6301- Kids could only rent up to 2 PS4 games every time. For Holiday Inn Patong Beach, the kids got to play multiple games in the XBox Console in the room without having to rent. - Poor quality of food at Pestos (We had a forgettable dinner at Pestos. Not sure what we were eating for the price we paid.)- Limited command of English language. (Most staff were unable to understand simple English. I would have expected better standards at Holiday Inn.)- Lengthy process to fix the bathtub issue (The kids wanted to enjoy the bubble bath in the bathtub before we leave the resort. However, the process for repair was lengthy and we were required to sign a form before the repair can commence. We did not do it in the end.)","June 19, 2019","23    Holiday Inn Resort Phuket Mai Khao Beach

1317,"We thoroughly loved this hotel. Its located on Mai Khao Beach, which is 11 kms of pristine sand and no commerical activity. The rooms were cozy and the breakfast was as it should be at a Holiday Inn Resort. The Spa was a little expensive but was amazing. They had a cocktail evening for IHG members which was fun. The Restaurants were great but we preferred to dine at the local restaurants 50m walk from the Resort for a more authentic local experience. its a great place for a relaxed vacation.","June 8, 2019","23    Holiday Inn Resort Phuket Mai Khao Beach

1320,"The reason for booking this hotel was to board a early morning flight on our way back to Bangkok this being one of the closest to airport. This also was my first stay in HolidayInn. I thought it was a budget range of hotels and hence did not have great expectations before check in. Though simple, the resort basically was good with nice comfortable rooms and all basic amenities in the room. The resort had a nice swimming pool, a very lovely private beach and a fantastic beach restaurant.The rooms are of two varieties - one with a little meandering pool and without a pool. If you are travelling with little children, the one with a meandering pool is recommended.Breakfast spread was ok with a nice spread but not as large as you find In a Marriott types. However, nothing to complain as the variety was still good for an international brand. Staff service was good with all basic requirements taken care - no complaints but not a one with a “Wow” experience ","May 19, 2019","23    Holiday Inn Resort Phuket Mai Khao Beach

1322,"For me this hotel has three main drawbacks that would put me off coming again.Firstly the hotel seemed to have an insect problem. Every night the corridor outside our room was littered with beetles and other bugs. Perhaps it’s a seasonal thing because they seemed to be dying off. They could be found elsewhere as well including in lifts, in the outdoor restaurant and pool area. I know that they are harmless and that you can’t necessarily control nature but I didn’t see them anywhere else in Thailand and I found them really off putting. Thankfully there were none in our room and they were cleaned up by the morning. The second problem is that you can’t swim in the sea here. There was a red flag up all the time we were there and large waves. I think you can only swim there on very calm days and at certain times of the year. The hotel is also very far from the main areas and there is only one shop and a couple of basic Thai restaurants within walking distance. The positives are that our room was clean and modern, the AC worked well. The pool was good but needs maintenance, part of it was closed off. The restaurants were ok but could be improved, in particular Js was nice but lacked in ambience and felt like a school canteen. ","May 6, 2019","23    Holiday Inn Resort Phuket Mai Khao Beach

1324,"I have been staying in this hotel for the past 6 and a half years, total 16 times. As usual I checked in this weekend just before May Day. As a platinum Elite membership the staff there always treated me very nice and the hotel always upgraded me to pool access room which is my favourite. This time round the room was full so I was not offered. Fair enough. I checked in in the early evening and the front desk staff Ms FADA was very nice, polite and friendly. She apologised for not having my desired room but she offered me the pool access room the next day.I asked her to send her senior staff so that I could meet her and have a word with her. There cane the Assistant Front Office Manager Ms Joof. After a couple of conversation exchange she appeared in very bad and wrong gesture over our communication. I was so mad and said that I wanted to move out straightaway. To my surprise she said to me that I could immediately check out and I will be refunded. Being a customer of 16 times in this resort and also Platinum Elite members for 7 years I don’t think that I deserve this type of treatment . Meanwhile Ms FADA was so nice that she offered me an alternative room upgrade and I really think her fir being so nice and kind, she deserved my compliment to her good service.I would like to talk to the General Manager of this resort and share with him my experience.","April 26, 2019","23    Holiday Inn Resort Phuket Mai Khao Beach

1325,"The Holiday Inn Mai Khao was our choice for the first family holiday with our family, including a 7 month old baby granddaughter. The rooms with pool access were perfect for the adults to have a swim while baby had her daytime naps. Although we did not have adjoining rooms, it was easy for us to swim across to each other’s rooms. The water being so warm allowed for baby to enjoy her swimming experience as well.We visited the Holiday Inn over the Easter long weekend, a very busy time for the resort. Observing the egg station’s chef at breakfast taking orders in multiple languages with a cheerful smile and personalised attention was an absolute delight. The breakfast buffet catered for everybody’s tastes with a huge variety of foods. A special shout-out to Nim, who was so friendly and cheerful, paying special attention to our baby, even when run off her feet looking after all the guests.If you have been to Mai Khao beach you will have experienced the spectacular sunsets. Our favourite time was happy hour when we could sit on the beanbags with a late afternoon cocktail, baby playing with her toys, enjoying the sunset with our family. The beach buffet night with a fire dancer is an absolute highlight, with tasty food and great entertainment.The resort’s facilities are not luxurious, but it has something for everyone: Many organised activities for the children, an indoor and outdoor play area, large swimming pool with a swim-up bar, a well-equipped fitness centre (Kee is a fun yoga and pilates instructor), fabulous spa, movie nights and more.A great place for a family holiday if you have young children.

1327,"We had high hopes for this one, and we were constantly disappointed. Nice facilities and location but disorganized, slow, uncommunicative, and an always one step behind staff. There was a problem every day we were there, from the second we tried to check in and had to wait in the open air lobby for 4 hours in 98 degree temperatures at middday to get into our rooms and constantly being told ‘just a few more minutes’, to the maids not leaving towels after cleaning rooms, to paid deposits to buy food and drink at the pool bar never working, to the AC cutting off in the middle of the night twice during our stay and waking up in a pool of sweat, to the keys not working or getting cut off early, to the yelling towel guy by the pool, to the inability of staff to communicate how to extend checkout for late international flights out (as simple as buying an extra day), to having to walk the length of the resort every time the hotel couldn’t get their act together and then standing in line at the front desk for 10-15 minutes each time.

1329,"Mai Khao is different from other beach places like Khao Lak or Kamala -a steeper beach, taxis expensive especially for the short ride to Turtle Village, no local pickup transport with bench seats (not sure what they are called), and massages more expensive and more tour groups maybe because of being close to the airport. Apart from that a great place to relax for a few days As an IHG member, we were upgraded to a nice room with entrance onto garden- lots of nice trees and flowers and a voucher for a welcome drink. The pool area is a bit congested but we enjoyed the sunbeds under the shade of the trees. - just need more beds. There are 2 options for breakfast- the main restaurant has the usual selection of eggs, waffles, excellent fruit and delicious almond and chocolate croissants to finish with. A compliment to the big Thai chef at the noodle bar who came around and helped my wife put together a very good combination when she hadn't a clue what she was doing. The Presto restaurant by the swimming pool is a la carte. Fruit, excellent Norwegian eggs benedict with salmon, raspberry blinis and great coffee with a view of the beach - very good and much quieter. Lots of local restaurants nearby for a change from hotel food - Mamas and Noonits good for lunch or dinner, and Seaside Cottage a 3 minute walk up to the right under the trees was cheap and tasty. They also have free bikes (some need air and a bit of repair) which you can use to go to the 7 Eleven or the beach towards the airport for a change of scenery.

The nearby beach was a lovely quiet spot to enjoy the sunset, but the pool area felt small for the size of the resort, with too few available spots to relax.

Many thinks about this resort are worth five stars, but service issues fell short.The rooms were nicely appointed and designed and in the larger room we stayed in, perfect for families. The location is excellent for a quiet getaway: Mai Khao beach is very secluded and doesn't get crowded even in peak season. The hotel faces onto the beach, perfect!The pool, although smallish, is perfect for relaxing and lounging on: although the deck chairs get nabbed early!Because we had a young toddler, who happened to be ill the first few days, we had lunch at the on-site restaurants most days to escape the heat of the few local restaurants. Some of the food was superb (e.g. chicken Massaman curry), others were misses. The ""kids eat free"" programme offers fair value (although prices of the regular menu are more than double the nearby local places) but the actual dishes are not that great. However, service at the restaurants was poor, sometimes shambolic, even when they weren't busy. We also had a few other (minor) service issues, which although not a big deal in themselves, added up to annoyance.Having said that, we would consider staying here again.","February 6, 2019","23    Holiday Inn Resort Phuket Mai Khao Beach

Food was overall of good quality. Pool is great for kids and pool bar is great for drink or two and for fresh coconut water. Location of this resort is not suitable if you want to visit markets. This is almost in middle of nowhere and requires a taxi ride to nearest 7 eleven store (300 Baht return trip). We wanted something like this so was not an issue for us.

1342,Good hotel well spread the pros are the smiling team members and breakfast every morning. All staff were smiling and wishing which was good. The bed sheet and pillows were good quality but same cant be said about towels which were not fluffy. The wifi was GOOD which helped us remain connected during our stay. Cons: The sofa kept in room was dirty and looked not shampooed for ages. The house keeping is a let down as room while cleaning some parts were completely overlooked. The tea coffee station was not refilled twice or glasses cleaned in my four days stay. Two days they forgot to keep drinking water. No dental and shaving kits were offered though the charges were above 8000 bhatt per day. The worst was presence of baby lizard and cockroaches in room.The travel desk is a cheat as for phi phi tour they asked for 6800 bhatt for couple which locally same package was for 3900 including to and fro taxi The airport drop quoted by hotel was 700 where as taxi stand has printed rates of 600 and we finally got a local taxi for 500 Bhatt. So be watchful The spa again is highly over priced which should be relooked at if more foot falls are needed.

Close to beach which was very nice, especially at sunset. You can also use the hotel bicycles for free for 2 hours, good to go down the beach and see the close overhead planes landing and taking off at airport on the beach. Overall good stay and mostly all staff smile and very friendly. A few footnotes that prevented me giving 5 stars;* hotel shuttle not cheap and doesn’t run to airport, need to book separate connection which is overpriced considering close proximity to airport. 800b for 14km unreasonable. If return will get a rental car.* TV remote and cable system failed day 2 and needed replacement, which was fixed to the Hotel’s credit.

1344,"The resort is great for relaxing and getting out of the hustle and bustle of the busier areas of Phuket. The beach is pristine and great for long soaks. The water here is calm and good for paddling sports. The hotel has SUP, kayaks, and a few other water toys, but are available for a charge. But basically it's sand and water so if snorkeling is on your list this isn't the spot.We stayed in the family suite with one king bed and two singles. Super awesome for families where mom and dad want some privacy. The two sleeping areas are separated by a door and both have their own ensuite bathrooms. Perfect way to get the day started with two full washrooms with showers.The breakfast buffets here are amazing and the room was very clean. Staff at the hotel were super pleasant and helpful. Although the food is good in the evenings, especially the Thai food, it is on the pricier side. My only complaint is that it is quite removed from most of the major attractions and things to do on Phuket. So you'll be constantly shelling out for cabs. But that's the price of quiet at the end of the day.A super nice resort but I wouldn't quite place it at the luxury level.*** Little tip. The gift store prices for bottled water are ok. But if you're looking for beer, liquor, sunscreen, etc. a 2 minute walk around the corner of the resort there's a mini mart with almost everything you'd need at way better prices***","January 6, 2019","23    Holiday Inn Resort Phuket Mai Khao Beach

1346,"We booked 4 nights at the Holiday Inn Resort Mai Khao in the run up to Christmas in Phuket after spending 4 nights last Christmas at the Holiday Inn Resort Bali Benoa -- which we loved (our review here https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g1465999-d7185368-r549934363-Holiday_Inn_Resort_Bali_Benoa-Tanjung_Benoa_Nusa_Dua_Peninsula_Bali.html). However, this property did not match the quality of the resort in Bali. The room was nice and spacious, but we found housekeeping to be a bit hit or miss. The a/c worked well, but kept shutting off randomly in the kids room during the night. The bath in the kids room is nice and large, but there was no way to get it to fill, and it was quiet slippery (not great for little kids in the end). Outside our room, 1 of the 2 elevators was out of service for the 3 days we were there. Breakfast had a lot of food choices, but of so-so quality. While the front desk staff were good, we found most other staff had poor english, and we struggled a bit to communicate our needs. The food at the Pesto restaurant wasn't bad, but not great for the money charged we felt. The live music was nice however. The beach was also nice, and had a little shade even from some of the trees in the morning. The pool was ok, though also felt like it needs to be refurbished (the tiles were a bit rough). And not much for kids other than shallow area (no slide, etc). The kids club was starting to show some wear, the a/c was leaking one day, and what we observed was that more attention could have been paid to the children. My kids loved the trampoline, and we liked the thai restaurant next door, which was great for dinners. Upon returning to the resort on our 3rd day, the electricity was out. We were told it was the entire area (though our friends at another Mai Khao resort did not report any issues). Anyhow, we decided to leave 1 day early. The front desk manager graciously took our constructive feedback, and allowed us to leave. Overall, I would say the resort was maybe a bad fit for us. However, given its affordable option (especially for families), if you aren't too picky, could be an okay choice for some.","January 1, 2019","23    Holiday Inn Resort Phuket Mai Khao Beach

1347,"As many other guests have stated in their reviews, this property is beautiful, well-maintained, and the perfect get-away for a relaxing holiday in the Northern and more tranquil part of Phuket. Staff and service were on par with the rest of Thailand as far as I was concerned (all was efficient, but I did not notice anything extraordinarily positive).I stayed for 3 nights in Dec 2018/Jan 2019, which obviously is peak season. However, what was really dissatisfactory to me was the way my room allocation had been handled. Basically it had been decided from the very beginning that I would be put into building #8 on a level above ground floor. As I was going to find out, this property only has 1 shared infinity pool (and although it appeared large , it was very crowded during a period of peak occupancy such as year-end) and building #8 is the furthest away from it. For me this was highly inconvenient. For a resort of this size, I would expect at least a 2nd pool to alleviate the overcrowdedness and to facilitate easier pool access for guests in buildings far away from the infinity pool (such as building #8).It should be noted that the ground floor rooms in buildings #6, #7, #8 have a private pool each. I overheard that another guest who checked in later than me (I was still waiting near the lobby because the room earmarked to me was still being cleaned at that time) was upgraded to such a room thanks to his status but I was not - despite being a Spire Elite member. When I inquired on the following two mornings whether any ground floor room with private pool access was available, I was told they were all occupied.Although I generally enjoyed my time in Phuket, the handling of my room allocation prompted me to minimize in-house spending, i.e. except for lunch at check-in (because the room allocated to me was being cleaned until 14:30), I had all my meals incl. breakfast and my laundry done outside the hotel.In short (and leaving aside the question how management and front desk staff decide on room allocation and discretionary upgrades): I would recommend this property only if you have assurance of either getting a room with private pool access or a room in buildings #1, #2, or #4, which are in close proximity to the shared infinity pool.","December 31, 2018","23    Holiday Inn Resort Phuket Mai Khao Beach

1349,"I will admit, that I am probably easier to please than others. That being said, this resort was perfect for the getaway we were looking for. This is not a party hotel in the least, it has children from all over the world staying here and having a great time. The people who are working here are very polite, and they will work hard to make sure you are enjoying yourself. There was one group of younger people, early 20s that came to party and they were rambunctious one evening and after that not at all. The resort is on a public beach, but the only people who go on the beach are the resort goers as it is kind of out of the way.The bad- the bicycles you can get from the front desk are in desperate need of tuneups. The discounts you are supposed to get for being a gold or platinum IHG member are not always applied unless asked for, I charged everything to my room thinking it would be automatic, it was not. I just paid the normal fees instead of trying to explain it to the front desk person and looking like a coupon shopper.The restaurants in the hotel are really expensive, the food is good, but not better then the local places next door for 1/4 the cost.The resort is about an hour and a half away from main attractions on the island, shuttles are easily arranged though. The secluded nature of the resort is the main reason I would go back, no loud party goers, beautiful clean beach and a great family atmosphere.All in all I would without hesitation recommend this place to my friends.","December 22, 2018","23    Holiday Inn Resort Phuket Mai Khao Beach

1350,"We spent 4D3N at this lovely resort to celebrate our second weddinh anniversary together with our 9 month old infant who enjoyed the stay as much as we did! We loved every single thing about this resortThe staff there were very professional, friendly and efficient. They even offered a helping hand with my little one too! Every single staff we came across greeted us warmly and did their best to attend to our needs. They even paid particular attention and even happily entertained my little one who seem to like them as well. They helped us plan a trip down to a clean grocery store nearby (about 10 minutes away) and backThe food from both restaurants (we had a specially planned suprise anniversary dinner from my husband who planned it together with the staff) were excellent as well. You can request for Halal meal too. For lunch we ate outside the resort, just a five minute walk away lies several muslim owned shops selling and a restaurant who were welcomed us with open arms. We had the room with pool access; best decision ever! Both the room and pool was immaculate. Very spacious and absolutely comfortable too. The main pool by the beach was also cool. I even checked out the kids club where my little one had fun crawling in the ball pool.We loved the beach too, very clean and refreshing! The sunset was spectacular.Would definitely consider to come back to this particular resort in the near future when we visit Phuket, this time with our friends and family!Thank you so much!","December 20, 2018","23    Holiday Inn Resort Phuket Mai Khao Beach

1351,"This is a great family resort. We stayed a total of 4 nights. First night we were upgraded to the Mai Khao pool access room then the next 3 nights in the executive pool access suite. We liked the latter room better, although smaller the layout was more simpler and felt roomier than the bigger room. The shower was great but lacked water pressure at times. The AC was excellent. Couldn't hear our neighbors either. Bed was slightly firm but comfortable. Pillow choice excellent. The walk to the pool is beautiful, the gardens are meticulously looked after. The pool was huge with a well thought out layout. There were a lot of chairs to lounge around on and it never felt overcrowded. The kids pool is great, my 4yr old son loved it.. however it gets full sun until about 4pm. The swim up bar in the deeper pool is great and there was always someone lovely waiting to make you a drink. It's also worth noting that there is no smoking on the pool lounges which is good, as there are many kids around.. theres many designated smoking areas around however, including some of the main lounge areas. the food at pestos was great but dont expect it to be 100% Italian. Quality and serving sizing were fantastic. Kids meals were generous also. Buffet breakfast was fantastic with ample choice for all appetites.. we enjoyed the Thai breakfast specials that were dotted around the buffet with explanations of what they were. We ordered room service 1 night and it was really good also. I forgot to mention that the lagoon pool that you access from your room is nice and cool, cooler than the main pool. We really enjoyed the pool access, I recommend upgrading your room. There are a few restaurants and convenience shops outside the hotel that basically serve the same thing.. not a huge amount cheaper than the hotel but recommended to try. The beach was slightly rough when we arrived (due to full moon) but it became gentle and was really nice to swim in. Having direct access to the beach outweighs the location. We absolutely recommend this hotel to anyone who is looking for a more quiet getaway.. there is no nightlife here and getting anywhere will cost $. This is the type of resort you stay in and enjoy its facilities. I plan to bring my in laws here next year for their first time to Phuket. The accom price is also very good for what you get.

1352,The room was full of ants literally everywhere - they are probably now in my suitcase and clothes hoping for a ride home with me. They certainly were in my laptop and my papers. Possibly due to a rotten rose apple that they left in the room as a welcome gift. We got locked into our room for 50 minutes on the Saturday morning due to a faulty security lock which somehow locked us in - we could not escape as we were on the third floor. No-one came to assist us for over 30 minutes and eventually they had to drill us out and break the door. The food in pesto's is awful so make sure you eat out if you can.The breakfast is fine with lots of variety but they do not clean the furniture so most of their chair arms are sticky and not nice to sit on.

1355,"We enjoyed our stay at the holiday inn. The room and accommodations were very nice. We enjoyed the large infinity pool. The breakfast buffet was excellent. Unfortunately the beach had a significant number of jellyfish when we were there and one could not swim in the ocean. What I enjoyed the most about this property, was the surrounding small shops, restaurants, and facilities. There are several very nice restaurants off property including Seaside restaurant which is walkable. There was offsite laundry service that was affordable. There was also a small store where one could purchase snacks and alcohol. The biggest drawback to the resort is the distance from Phuket city and a town if you have interest in traveling there. The taxi fare is over 1000 baht (around $30+ USD one-way, and it is alittle over 1 hour commute one-way. The hotel does offer a reduced rate shuttle service but not at night. For the value, it is a very nice hotel and accommodation, also very children friendly, one just has to understand the distance and cost to travel to other locations on the island.","November 6, 2018","23    Holiday Inn Resort Phuket Mai Khao Beach

There was a blow dryer and iron in the room.The beach was very secluded. At times we were the only ones on the beach in October. The included breakfast was buffet style and catered to many cultures. It also had a chef for making individual omelettes. The only issue with this hotel is that it is far away from the city or shopping (like 1 hour to 1 1/2 hour drive) and far from excursions. It does offer a one time free shuttle to the Patong otherwise it is very expensive to take the shuttle or taxi.Other than the hotel, the restaurants in the area are limited to open air cabanas with no air conditioning and it is very hot. They do add to the tropical island feel of the area though, and all of the food is delicious and inexpensive.

Nice kid area as well that you can drop them off if you need a break. And the food was great too. Prices for food are high for Thailand, but considering kids eat free, the prices are inline with the costs at the few local restaurants that are nearby.

1360,"Lovely peaceful hotel on a beautiful beach. Staff were very accommodating especially when I got ill with gastroenteritis. It was not from hotel food btw! One even visited me in hospital... big pleasant surprise. My only criticism is the litter on the beach . The staff work diligently to remove every twig from walkways and every leaf from the pools but a few feet off property and no effort. Apparently it's public beach so not their responsibility! Well a lot of guests walked through litter to get on beach so I would say it was in the hotel's interest to invest a bit of time and effort on the beach. If I had not have become ill i would have done some litter picking myself. Phuket is a horrendous place in the south of the island, terrible traffic and too many tourists , the locals and tourists are doing a great job of destroying their beautiful little island. So being in the North less developed part is a definite advantage and I would definitely come back but to this area... leave the rest of the island to the hordes.","September 26, 2018","23    Holiday Inn Resort Phuket Mai Khao Beach

1364,"Did a 5D4N at the resort, the room was nice and comfy. We got the pool access rooms, where the balcony leads directly into a pool. That’s really the main attraction for us. We are in the pool almost twice a day, everyday. Beds and pillows are nice. You get to choose firm or soft pillows and it’s embroidered onto the pillow case.Bathroom and toilet are separate, good for family use. Bath area was huge, and we requested a baby tub for our 8mth old. The bath area was big enough to fit us and the tub.Service was typical of Thai culture, nice and friendly. So no complains there. Their duty manager also calls daily to check if we needed anything. I personally found that a tad annoying, cos they would call when the kids are napping.Food options at the resort are limited to 2 restaurants and a deli. All of which are not fantastic. We had our first night’s dinner at J restaurant, it was a disappointing Thai buffet for 590++ per pax. Tiny selection and limited quantities, it was like they were getting ready to close shop at 7pm! Daily breakfast at J restaurant is much better and more like a buffet, 5 times the spread available for dinner and it’s alrdy included in the room price.Pesto is the Italian restaurant they have, food is not bad, but nothing to rave about for the price. The deli also doubles as a mini mart for some essentials.Mai Khao Holiday Inn is relatively secluded, but it has a few restaurants and a mini mart outside which will be all you need to survive the trip here. Getting to town would require you to book a shuttle from the hotel for a fee or just get the cab that’s always waiting outside the hotel. Listed prices for the trip to town seems to be about 580baht. Seem pricey to us and we had no intention to go to town for this trip.Facilities wise, best part is to have immediate access to a pool. There’s also another larger infinity pool closer to the beach but that one felt under maintained. Many tiles are alrdy gone and the concrete patchwork they did were poor, making the surface jagged and dangerous. They have a giant chessboard and checkers and a trampoline on the main lawn. Good for some running around with the kids.There’s also a beach volleyball court setup near the beach among the pine trees. They also setup a few hammocks for you to laze around.The Kids club is one of our most frequently used facility. It has a huge ball pit and plenty of toys. They have friendly staff to keep the kiddos entertained with art n craft work periodically. Some parents who just leave their kids here the entire day while they have their own programs.Just before the beach there’s a big hut where you can get a Thai massage for 500baht. I don’t think is part of the hotel facility as the hotel has their own SPA.Coming during the monsoon season has its pros n cons. It’s relatively less crowded, but you still do get the bus loads of tourists from China. Weather is hot when the sun is out, but most of the time it’s cloudy with short lived showers. I like the wind a lot and this season gives you plenty of it.","August 23, 2018","23    Holiday Inn Resort Phuket Mai Khao Beach

1369,I have been to a few Detox centre's in Thailand but found Atmanjai with one of the best facilities and caring stuff. Nothing is an issue here. The stuff are warm friendly and help you every step of the way to make your stay a comfortable and your detox as successful as it can. The surroundings are perfected nestled in the trees and there is plenty of energy from nature in this place. Situated right on the beach and as the sun comes up a walk on the beach is so refreshing. I would not hesitate to recommend Atmanjai for your next detox. Try it and it will change your life.,"May 29, 2019","24    Friendship Beach Resort & Atmanjai Wellness Ce...

The positive is that it is beachfront and the breakfast is ok. swimming pool is fine plus there is a gym (very old equipment but you can do your work out). I liked the outdoor shower in my room.

1373,"My mother and I recently stayed at Friendship Beach Resort for our third time. We consider it to be one of the BEST Places to stay in Phuket. The resort itself is everything you could ask for when looking for a vacation spot for couples, families, and single people alike. It's linked with Atmanjai Wellness Center which has optimal classes and detox's to choose from if that's your desire. The swimming pool is just lovely, we used it every day!! We stayed in room 40 which is adjacent to the beach with an outdoor bathroom and private porch. The staff go way beyond their means in catering to anything that you could need. Ms. Jay is very resourceful in helping you research any activities around the island. She even told me where to go get my watch fixed which was a short trip to Chalong. I rented a scooter while I was there, all of which the front desk concierge took care of for me. I did not have to go to p/u the bike, nor return it which was handy! My mother is in her mid-eighties and suffers from severe COPD with very little lung capacity making it difficult for her to get around. When we arrived at Friendship at 9pm there was no wheelchair for her (as there was one on our previous trip) to use bc it was broken at the time. . . by the time morning came around, they had gone out of their way to get one from their sister hotel ""The Serenity Hotel "", just up the road and had it waiting for us outside our room. The beach is quiet and has the most amazing sunrises you ever see. There is a lovely warm trade wind that welcomes you in the morning and settles in the afternoon as the tide resides. Kitezone is next door which is fun to watch as the practice, There's so much I could say about Friendship Beach Resort. It will forever be our favorite getaway. This is a resort for relaxation, rejuvenation, and recentering. Bring a book and settle into the stress-free surroundings. You will not regret it! Oh yeah... The food: a huge variety from healthy vegan options to banana pancakes with chocolate syrup. The staff: accommodating and welcoming, always greeting you with that Warm Thai Smile and don't forget to say hello to ""Love"" the resort dog who enjoys basking in the sun just as much as we did! Can't wait to get back next year!","February 13, 2019","24    Friendship Beach Resort & Atmanjai Wellness Ce...

1376,"I had a really mixed experience during my 2 night stay here. The property is very pretty, and right on the water which was the selling point for me. The pool is nice, and it was fun to walk into the bay when the tide went out in the afternoon. It’s not the best beach, but it’s swimmable in the morning, and the kite surfing place next door also rents kayaks and SUPs. I had a massage at the spa, which was top-notch. The room was comfortable and looked well equipped for a longer stay, although most of the corners needed a good vacuuming. I enjoyed the restaurant, which offered a nice variety of raw veggie food, (but almost no vegan options on the breakfast menu).The real issue I had was the lack of hospitality- from a frustrating and extremely slow correspondence with the reservations department, to the poolside staff who were (mostly) so innattentive I wasn’t sure if it was me or them on vacation. I’m all for a relaxed vibe, but it just didn’t feel that welcoming.","January 9, 2019","24    Friendship Beach Resort & Atmanjai Wellness Ce...

1382,"I had an amazing and excellent experience at Atmanjai. I was there for the fitness and yoga program, and this was the first time I did a program like this. Everything was highly organized even before I arrived there, and reservation manager Took was always helpful (she even called me to clarify something). The pickup from the airport was without issue as was check in. The room was nice and clean, and make note that the air conditioning unit was maintained properly (no fungus inside), which can be hard to do in a tropical area. I am highly sensitive to such fungus and can become ill easily when in contact with it. The yoga classes in the morning and evening were really nice, and the instructors guide and correct you. I also had the fitness classes in the morning and these were interesting. The daily activity varied each day: one day was to the beach while another was a raw cooking class. Massages that were part of the package were nice, too. The restaurant staff were all friendly and they know everyone's name. In fact if they see you walking around they'll ask if you need water or you want your meal! The staff at Atmanjai was really nice too. They know everyone's daily schedule and can make reasonable adjustments. They make you feel welcome. Although I came alone, most other participants came alone as well, so everyone bonds quite easily. I did not feel isolated since everyone has the same interest in mind. I highly recommend this program. The beach is decent, but you can only go in the water from about 11h to 15h. After that the tide goes away. But that is sufficient. Pool is nice, although a few more sun loungers would be useful.","December 3, 2018","24    Friendship Beach Resort & Atmanjai Wellness Ce...

1384,"When my husband and I found ourselves with 12 days to spare we decided to try a detox, we figured we both needed it and it would be a bonding experience!I am a big researcher and I searched across all of Thailand and Bali for a detox retreat that wouldn't cost a fortune and that would support us on our journey. Atmanjai ticked all the boxes:I hasten to add that neither of us had ever done anything like this before. When we got there we couldn't believe how many people were returning customers, people of all ages and backgrounds come here to look at their physical health but end up looking at their mental health, after all the two are totally intertwined!If I can I will definitely come back. You are supported all the way by the wonderful staff, from the front desk to the massage ladies to the ladies in the Colema rooms to the support staff. There is always someone to talk to and answer questions on the body or else the meaning of life!The Detox is very well organised, we did 10 days of Ultra Cleanse and 1 day of Eat Well and never felt better. I am still Vegan now 3 weeks on and my husband also. My weight has stabilised, my body is tighter and less puffy, I look 10 years younger. People who haven't seen me for a while keep asking what I've done! It comes out as a glow in the skin and a sparkle in the eyes...but most importantly it is about empowerment. Knowing you are your own best doctor, what you put into your body determines what you get out of it. Atmanjai detoxes help to clear years of built up muck and then they teach you and support you to continue on the right path after you leave.The resort is super chill, the restaurant absolutely delicious, you get your own Colema room for the entire stay (which is a huge plus) the hotel beds are really comfortable and I already said it, the staff are A1.Do yourself and your body a favour....go there...you won't be disappointed.","November 21, 2018","24    Friendship Beach Resort & Atmanjai Wellness Ce...

1385,"How many times have you heard people say ""you are what you eat""? And how many times have you just thought... mmm.. that is not for me, I eat whatever I want, leave me alone!I had a rude awaking a month ago, I had just turned 55 and my doctor basically told me that if I did not change my relationship with food and wine, I would shorten my life by a considerable amount of years. That because of my reckless eating habits, my wine drinking and my stressful job I was now prone to hearth desease and probably type 2 diabetes. In mid October 2018 my total cholesterol was 7.2 (anything above 6.2 is deemed high) with my LDL at 4.7 approaching the 4.9 Very High mark) My blood pressure WITH medication was hovering daily at around 140/115. Needless to say the numbers had been going up through out the years, I had ignored the numbers and the doctor's advices for years!. But it was time to take action. I changed my diet in mid October and have stuck to it since. I stop eating animal meats or fats. I kept mostly vegetarian with one or two fish dishes a week. It was not easy, the first 3 days I had terrible headaches, my body wanted the carbs, the saturated fats, and the sugars, my brain kept saying: said wine, wine wine.... In late October I checked into Admanjai for an 11 day stay. The place really gave me a push towards my goal of eating differently, and understanding that we are indeed and without a doubt what we eat. At Atmanjai I did Ultra Cleanse for 7 days, and Eat Well on arrival and two before traveling. The stay at Atmanjai sparked in me the need to understand what is the impact of everything I eat on my body. The detox for 11 days help me reboot my body and mind, the first 3 days there are the hardest. The team there is superb, and they guided me day by day coaching me and helping me achieve my goals. I took cooking classes, did yoga, learned to meditation, had daily massages. There are also different types of healing therapies to chose from. Finally the interaction with the other guests, their stories of why they were there, were extremely uplifting. I got more out of my trip than I could ever had imagined. My blood test results arrived today, a month after my prior test. My total cholesterol is now normal 4.3 (vs 7.2), my bad cholesterol LDL is now at 2.9 (vs.4.7). My blood pressure is now 120/80. And I lost 6 kilos. These changes were achieved just in one month. I would not have been able to do it without the help and the patience of the team in Atmanjai. I have continued my vegetarian diet plus fish, and I cannot wait to go back to the center next year!! Highly recommended to anyone that needs a new fresh start in their eating and drinking habits.","November 15, 2018","24    Friendship Beach Resort & Atmanjai Wellness Ce...

1386,"Where do I start?1. Checking in with the night receptionist was such an unpleasant experience. None of that Thai hospitality, her demeanour bordered on rude and disgruntled that she had to pause the show she was watching on her tablet to check us in. Dear receptionist, if you are reading this, sorry to have bothered you but also you seem to be in the wrong job. 2. Room furniture and fixtures looked tired. The stale stench of mold greeted us the minute we opened the door and we checked into 2 different rooms during our stay. ALL mattresses were sunk and old. 3. Food was average. The F&B crew weren’t the friendliest, again they all had the same disgruntled vibe similar to the night receptionist. There’s probably one or two girls who seemed to care enough to smile but the rest looked as sour as if they’d gulped pure vinegar. One of the girls charged my order to another room and expected me as a guest to inconvenience myself, walk to said sour-faced night receptionist, and explain it was all a big misunderstanding. Uhh, no I am your guest, you will have to deal with this yourself, thank you very much for trying to involve me, NOT. 4. Saving grace: Massages at Atmanjai were awesome. The spa receptionist was friendlier than the hotel staff. All good here. I also witnessed firsthand how the maintenance crew at the resort working tirelessly to keep the beach, pool, and resort clean. Imagine having to work until 1 am !If Gordon Ramsay were at the resort, he’d shut the place down. Hotel management has a lot of work to do. It seems like a resort that was once lush and glorious but somehow things have fallen in disarray. ","November 3, 2018","24    Friendship Beach Resort & Atmanjai Wellness Ce...

1390,"We stayed here in February 2018 for two nights as it was close to the wedding we were attending. Very lovely resort, the kids loved the pool and it was right on the beach although it isn’t one of the best Thai beaches I’ve been to. The food was really good, the menu looked delicious but we only had one meal there. Lovely accommodation, huge with a lounge/kitchen area, two bedrooms and two bathrooms, the outdoor showers were lovely (and very private!). Really child friendly, and really good for a normal hotel stay as well as being a spa retreat.The reception staff were super friendly and helpful, we very easily booked a taxi to the pier for our onward journey.

1391,"I had done a few cleanses over the past few years in various parts of the World, but this time, I wanted somewhere that was beachfront. I stumbled across Atmanjai on Google's search which seem to fit all the requirements that I was looking for. Now that I've completed the cleanse, i can confidently say it's definitely worth all the hype and rave. It was one of my favorite cleanse locations ever and I'll likely be returning when I'm in need of another life break. Program: The program is definitely one of the best I've ever had. The calendar is basically jammed with activities during the day (some fun and random ones like Jon's destiny reading, but massages and detox activities a plenty). The day and countdown (to how many ever days you are wishing to complete) does go by much faster because of this, which is pretty amazing. As for the health aspect of the program, definitely one of the best with the health supplements and talks. Only comment here is that I wish there had been more activities during the day (offsite visits / more health talks) and would have liked to have more of the infrared saunas included (1 included per wk on UC) since I hear this is extremely beneficial to those detoxing (some of my programs included this daily). But other than that, definitely one of the most inclusive and flexible programs I've ever experienced but didn't get to explore much of Phuket (Big Buddha, night markets, sunsets on the water, etc.)Facilities: Overall, this oasis definitely exceeded expectations. The restaurant (raw food and salads are amazing here), the pool, the environment, the yoga room, the location right on the beach all added positively to my experience. Mosquitos are quite vicious here, although they seem to love me in any part of the World. Most of my cleanses were in the jungle or somewhere far from water, which for me is extremely important. This is a personal preference though because I find the water so soothing and glad that this place had it all. Agree with the other reviews though as the rooms here are pretty basic although guests are given the option to upgrade to Serenity which does look amazing (despite the walk). If it were next door, no doubt, this would be the ultimate cleansing spot for me since one on UC may not have too much energy to go to/from. For this I was glad to have stayed on site.Staff: And finally, the incredible staff were usually very friendly and accommodating. From the front desk to the program staff, if you had a request, they would usually try their best to be flexible or accommodate which makes the experience all the better. The consultants were incredibly friendly and understanding and it was my first time during a cleanse that I met a licensed Nutritionist! Given how much your health and body is impacted, it's definitely important to have a certified Nutritionist and I'm so glad they brought Nova on board! During the last few days of the program, I even shared some feedback with the manager and after talking it through, he was more than accommodating to help me resolve the issue. Having a team that supports and listens definitely makes or breaks the experience and mine was definitely made.Net Net - what the team has built as a program is amazing and you won't leave disappointed! Thanks Atmanjai! Keep doing what you are doing and look forward to seeing you all again soon, especially if there are returning customer discounts! =D","September 11, 2018","24    Friendship Beach Resort & Atmanjai Wellness Ce...

1393,"Atmanji for me was a memorable life experience . It was a programme incorporating the mind, the spirit and body. I arrived atmanji with specific goals and and it provided for me the formula to finding and understanding the balance between the mind, physical body , spirituality and emotions. It not only provided a cleansing for my body but best of all the programme provided me a great Mental Re-focus.The staff were very professional, caring and welcoming. From the reservations manager ""took"" to the front office wellness girls:) to the ever so happy cleaning staff.To say I was taken care off is an understatement. They all went out of their way to provide their guests with as much attention and love as possible,always with a smile on their face. Now I've had massages in many countries around the world but by far the best massages I've had have been in this resort. Every therapist so professional with almost the feeling of healing in their touch. Atmanji also orgainse sessions with private therapist/pranic healers who are all fantastic individuals with a lot of energy and wisdom.Finally , Izzy the manager was great ,a real knowlegable man ,inspiring to listen and to learn from.

1395,"A friend raved about Atmanjai and so I went. I spent a week, staying at the Friendship Hotel and going to the Wellness Centre, one day Eat Well at either end and 5 days Ultra Cleanse. The balance was perfect to ease in and out of a fast. The hotel setting is lovely - a gorgeous beach and lagoon to gaze at, an intimate pool but big enough to swim some lengths, an open bar and dining room overlooking the beach and lots of vegetation to add to the charm. I was fortunate to be upgraded to a beach room. It was clean and modern with a living area separate from the bedroom area. The bathroom was basic and the top of the walls open (but private) so you could see the trees and bushes, but I personally love this kind of thing because it has character and feels 'islandy'. It still had all the amenities. The raw food was surprisingly delicious and there were lots of varieties of juice. I didn't try the standard hotel menu. I found the staff very friendly everywhere, but particularly in the Wellness Centre where the smiles were joyful. They couldn't do enough to help (reception, yoga teachers and wellness advisors alike) and it made the atmosphere quite special. They set the scene for the Atmanjai visitors to be welcoming and supportive with each other. I really recommend the Wellness Centre. It offers more than the website suggests with additional lunch-time and early evening optional sessions of Yoga Nidra, Meditation, Reiki, documentaries on healthy eating, raw food cookery class, excursions, etc. The range of treatments, and the overall routine kept me much busier than I expected but was a welcome distraction from ever feeling hungry. An important tip - heed their advice on what to eat before coming. I did, except for one day, and felt no side effects Those who ate a normal diet and drank alcohol until the day before tended to feel really low energy, had headaches/hunger pains etc not so much fun on a holiday. I lost 5 kilos (though gained 1 after starting to eat again), felt lighter, healthier. I was sceptical about the colemas (colonic irrigation) before going but am now a convert. Now I have no bloating, no constipation, better metabolism and what felt like a total cleanout! There are other treatments for an additional price - an extraordinary physio (who sorted out a neck and shoulder problem I've had for years in one session), Energy healing, Reiki, rebirthing, cupping, acupuncture etc to address both physical and mindset/emotional issues. Others who did these sessions said they were very powerful - not cheap, but if they are on tap and powerful, it's worth investing.I thoroughly recommend this place and will be returning, as do many others.","August 7, 2018","24    Friendship Beach Resort & Atmanjai Wellness Ce...

1396,"Spent 6 days at Atmanjai in July. Last minute decision to go but was amazing. Did eat well on day 1 and ultra cleanse for the next 5 days. It was my first ultra cleanse but there were a number of people on the program that swear Atmanjai is among the best if not, the very best. Great program with lots of support and you are always active and busy. All different types of people were there during my visit but you will always find someone to talk to and connect with on your journey.Cannot recommend Atmanjai enough. If you need to make a change in your life either physically or mentally, this place will help you on your way! After 6 days I lost 6.5 kg, my blood pressure was within normal limits without medication and my asthma and allergies were great.Accommodation was clean and functional. If you want to stay somewhere more fancy, rooms are also available next door at serenity. I preferred staying at FB because you are right next to all the activities and are very near your room if you feel a bit tired and want some rest.Raw food at the restaurant was amazing. If you have a chance to do the eat well program your taste buds will be in heaven.Enjoy!","July 28, 2018","24    Friendship Beach Resort & Atmanjai Wellness Ce...

1397,"I visited Friendship beach and Atmanjai resort on a last minute solo trip I made when between jobs. I had seen Atmanjai a few months before but couldn’t book until a ten days prior to going and I looked on the website only to discover they were fully booked. I was super disappointed as it looked like exactly what I was looking for so I emailed them on the off chance the website might be incorrect. Following my email they replied to say they would make space for me if I didn’t mind moving rooms during my stay. It didn’t disappoint at all. As a first time solo traveller I was somewhat nervous when I got off the plane but I was greeted by my free transfer and taken to the hotel. I immediately felt reassured. The following morning I got up to greet my first sunrise which is stunning from the pool, I don’t think I’ve ever enjoyed getting up at 6.20 every day so much! This was followed by a walk on the beach or yoga every day. I also did fitness everyday and ate the very healthy gluten, dairy, and refined sugar free menu whilst I was there. They also run classes on meditation and diet every day as well as offering a massage every day too. After my week I can honestly say I left feeling one of the most happy and healthy I’ve felt in a very long time. Atmanjai is a truly special place run by special people and I can’t thank them enough for showing such passion and kindness for all they host. If your feeling run down or stressed or anxious this is the perfect place to heal and come back refreshed. ","July 26, 2018","24    Friendship Beach Resort & Atmanjai Wellness Ce...

1400,"Atmanjai This is my second year coming to Atmanjai and will probably be a yearly occurrence for the rest of my life. I live a hectic, stressful, western world lifestyle; therefore I have discovered going to Atmanjai yearly to basically, detox, recharge, rejuvenate and most importantly look after me, mentally, physically, mind, body and soul is essential! We don’t realise how toxic our busy lifestyle is and how we neglect our health, mind and body. At Atmanjai, I do the the DETOX PROGRAM: it removes backed up waste in the colon, the result is a cleansed digestive system, allowing you to feel lighter, improve nutrient absorption, reclaim your energy, detoxify the skin, eliminates bad bacteria, bloating, infections and elevate mental clarity. The program you can do for 7-14 days, to help bind and strip waste from the colonic wall and release it from the body. Then you can follow it by Raw Food, they provide all the herbal supplements, amazing healthy raw food, psyllium shakes, apple cider ginger, herbal teas, water to replenish your cells with nutrition, detoxify, heal and reenergise...I always feel amazing and has eliminated bacteria in my intestines as I was prone to always getting UTI’s and my immune system always run down, I don’t need to take loads of antibiotics and crap from the doctor after clearing my gut/system out and with all the talks, advise, yoga, meditation I handle stress a lot better and have learnt to prioritise what’s important to me; taking care of me and my overall health, mind and body. It’s a program EVERYONE needs to do and my aim is to try and get my poor depressed Mum who’s on so much medication and shriving away from depression. In addition, next year i want all my friends to join me!It’s truly the best holiday you could ever do for YOURSELF! You will look, feel and be the best inside and out. I love meeting all the people who come from all over the world, different background, ages, religions, and like me, come back yearly and all holistically have been cured/healed from so many diseases, problems, acne, depression, weigh lost, stress, stomach/gut issues etc all healed... It’s kind of simple, they take you back to the basics, firstly they start with clearing out all the crap we have accumulated over the years then replenish you with, amazing healthy fresh raw food, clearing our minds, learning how to appreciate, be happy, breath and be who we really are... Like I said a holiday everyone must do! Clear out all the stress, crap and toxins from our mind, body and souls ","July 15, 2018","24    Friendship Beach Resort & Atmanjai Wellness Ce...

1405,"Staff was so unhelpful and unfriendly. From the moment we got to the resort to check in after our flight there was no greeting no hello not even a smile the guy at the front desk just gave us the paper to sign to check in. At the restaurant they were rude as well and did not provide good service. I thought maybe it was just late and shrugged it off. But when we went to the front desk the next day to ask which beach was the nicest the woman wouldn’t even help us. She just wanted to make sure she had our credit card to charge. When I went to lay by the pool no one came over to offer me a drink or breakfast, which is fine if they don’t do that.. but then about 15 minutes later a couple comes and sits next to me and they come over and offer them any food or drink. I asked for a water bottle when she brought them their coffee and she gave me a dirty look and said “what’s you’re room number” (which she didn’t ask them) and brought it over and slammed it on the table. I am extremely disappointed by this resort and it honestly made my vacation very unpleasant staying here. I wish I spent a little more and stayed at a true 4 or 5 star resort. The pool is nice but that’s about the only nice thing. The room was disgusting with bugs all over and it smelled of mold and mildew, I think it was coming from the air conditioning. If you walk two feet out of the resort there was garbage everywhere. I wasn’t expecting 5 star service from such a cheap hotel but at least a smile would be nice.

1407,"I recently stayed at the Friendship Beach Resort and was on a fitness program with Atmanjai for 7 days. This was the first time I have done anything like this. Firstly, I would do this again and at the same place. The main reason was the organisation as once I arrived I didn't have to think much as everything was well organised. For example, each day had an individual program for myself, printed in advance so I knew where and when to be and also the day was pretty much full so I was never bored and always engaged. Another reason I would come again was that it attracted similar types of people. This is a place where it's comfortable to be as it has kind staff, professional in their approach and genuine in their interest. The other participants in programs were of mixed ages and sexes but all had the same goal of improving their health. It was just so nice to be in this environment with zero sense of competitiveness. There are a number of programs here. I participated in the fitness program which seemed to be the least popular but for no good reason that I could see. Typically the fitness program was 2 x yoga and 1 x fitness class (boxing, cardio, circuit type things). I would have preferred 1 x yoga and 2 x fitness class. The instructors vary according to the type of fitness class. All instructors were professional and experienced. The pace of fitness is appropriate the people's levels with lots of breaks to catch your breath. The heat makes it a challenge at times.Other inclusions were daily opt in or out excursions and educational talks and a daily massage. The use of steam room, ice bath and magnesium bath also included. Movies and documentaries were shown on a large screen tv each night but hard to hear as it was adjacent to the water feature and the frogs, insects and splashing water were very loud and drowned out the audio of the tv.The food associated with the fitness program was very healthy and had enough variety. I enjoyed the food very much.The accommodation was standard. It's certainly not a 5 star resort. My air conditioning was a bit noisy and the room was a bit old looking. The shower was a hand held device and not hot. My room backed onto the car park which was actually great for the program but not so good for relaxing in your room.Things to improve:Lift the standard of the fitness program. Introduce testing other than weight and blood pressure. Include BMI index, fat ratios etc and measure these. Make the fitness more tailored to individuals and not just classes to attend. It might be worth considering a Personal Trainer on the staff permanently who can follow through and get to know the participants better.As stated above do 1 x yoga daily + 2 x fitness daily. This is better for fitness I think.Include running but not on the beach as it is too dirty.Ban smoking around the pool and restaurant area. It's horrible to breath in smoke when on a fitness program.Update the movies and documentaries - they were a bit dated.Lower the cost. Given the room standard and the fact that the difference between the fitness program and everything else was just a class a day, then I think the cost should be lower.Things to keep doing:Organisation. This was excellent.The staff - very calming, friendly and assuring. Kudos for Sophie - my first impression and she was just wonderful.Food quality. Excellent and with enough variety.Thanks and I hope to see you again.Michael Carney","April 25, 2018","24    Friendship Beach Resort & Atmanjai Wellness Ce...

1409,"I stayed here for a night whilst in Thailand for 2 weeks. Maybe I had been spoilt by the main palace I was staying in (Baan Malinee) which was simply amazing; the friendship resort was very tired in comparison and a little dated. The room smelt of damp and as the electricity was linked to the key as you entered the room, the air con turned off as soon as you left. This made the smell worse and took ages to cool down. The room was ok but the outdoor shower was very dated (though had surprisingly good pressure) and looked like it might fall off the wall. The bed was super comfy though. Having enjoyed the tropical fruits of Thailand throughout my holiday, I ordered this for breakfast and it was really disappointing; I ripe and tasteless which considering there was a fruit market at the end of the hotel lane, pretty unforgivable! To be fair to the hotel the reception staff were friendly, though bar staff could try a similar tact. I personally did not like Rawai as much as where I was staying for the rest of the time as it was too built up and busy. This is a personal thing though. I was grateful to be heading back to Baan Malinee to be honest and was glad the stay at Friendship was just a night! ","April 3, 2018","24    Friendship Beach Resort & Atmanjai Wellness Ce...

The hotel is located on a hilltop, therefore getting up and down to your room can be quite a workout on it’s own, but for the views and general location – it is definitely worth having to climb those extra steps! They do provide an in-house Thai-style tuk tuk to bring you upto the higher rooms from the main reception (and vice versa), which is always available, as is the shuttle bus to the beach (even though it’s only a 5min walk from the hotel) so don’t be too put off by my mention of steps!","June 2, 2019","25    Orchidacea Resort - Kata Beach, Phuket

1426,"We've stayed at Orchidacea 4 times over the last 6 years, and this resort never grows old on us. Incredible sea views from most rooms, friendly staff, nice pool area. The resort is very well kept overall, very clean and neat looking. Staff at front desk speak good English and respond to your requests promptly. All staff is frendly and polite. One thing I have to mention though, there are lots of stairs and no lifts so getting to top floors could be quite physically demanding for some people. I'm not complaining about that though, never stopped me from enjoying my holidays there.Kata Beach is beautiful and Orchidacea is the place to stay there in my opinion.Highly recommended!","June 2, 2019","25    Orchidacea Resort - Kata Beach, Phuket

1431,"I loved my stay at Orchidacea Resort. There was a small misunderstanding in relation to the pick up time (from the ferry terminal) but the resort was always contactable and the staff were friendly. The driver was two hours early but was nice enough to wait till we arrived. When we arrived at the resort, we met with Marko who was just wonderful. He was warm and made us feel very welcome. He was also very attentive to our needs and gave us plenty of recommendations on the town. Getting to our room was a bit of a walk but the view of the beach is worth it. Rooms are clean and comfortable. There is also a nice pool area that will be good for families with young children. It is conveniently located and you will find an abundance of restaurants, bars, convenience stores, massage parlours, even pharmacies less than a five minute walk away from the resort. 10/10 - value for money and highly recommended!","May 10, 2019","25    Orchidacea Resort - Kata Beach, Phuket

1434,"We have had a wonderful holiday at this hotel (still 2 days left!) but wanted to review whilst we are still here! We honestly can not fault this hotel at all, after reading the reviews about the deluxe sea view rooms we decided to upgrade before we arrived as wanted to be guaranteed interconnecting rooms as we are on holiday with our 19 year old daughter. Wow the rooms didn’t disappoint, they are spacious with a wonderful view of kata beach the beds are so comfortable (better than our bed at home!) the air conditioning is amazing just what you need when the temperature is 35 degrees outside!! The staff on reception are so helpful want to give a special thanks to lovely Marcus he really is so helpful and friendly what ever you need he sorts. The food in the hotel is really good too with excellent service around the lovely pool, Thank you so much Dilip you have looked after us so well and always with a smile!! The hotel is spotless and the rooms are cleaned to an incredibly high standard every day. I know the steps are mentioned a lot in many reviews but they are fine I promise!! The hotel also offer a shuttle service to your rooms if you have been out and are tired after a long day (which we accepted after walking around the Naka night market Sunday night!!) We will be so sad to leave on Saturday but hope to return again one day. Trips we recommend ....... Anda elephant sanctuary Phi phi island tour (early start 6am pick up which avoids the crowds but so worth it!) Janes Bond island Thank you again to everyone at the orchidacea you could not have done any more to make our first visit to Thailand really special. ❤️","April 10, 2019","25    Orchidacea Resort - Kata Beach, Phuket

1439,"Was recommended Orchidacea Resort by mates who were having their wedding in a venue nearby, and I wasn't disappointed. Very friendly receptionists that cater to a wide variety of languages, and was able to help me with every need I had, with a smile. Rooms were comfortable and spacious for the price, good value accommodation. Hot water was instant and available. Beds were very comfortable; not too hard, not too soft. My balcony had an amazing view overlooking Kata Beach and adjacent resorts. I had a nice big window so I was able to wake up to this everyday during my stay.I spent a lot of time at the pool; was always clean and there were plenty of tanning beds around it. Coupled with the pool bar, on a lazy day, I didn't have to step foot outside the resort!Included breakfast was great and had a cook fry up a custom omelette for you. Checking in I was provided a 25% discount at their restaurant but I didn't get the chance to use it, but it was great that they provided it.If I can make some criticisms, the resort was constructed on a hill, and depending where your room is, it could take a bit of climbing up the stairs to get to it, but I think it's worth it. Also the aircon I had in the room, while strong and adequate, was a little noisy.In all, a top experience with nearby Kata and Katanoi Beaches in walking distance so there's plenty to do without the hustle and bustle of Patong.","February 25, 2019","25    Orchidacea Resort - Kata Beach, Phuket

So much to do and so many places to visit your holiday goes very quick, the hotel was lovely; staff were very polite and always on hand including the receptionist who helped at every need. We got upgraded to a sea view room and wow what a view. Yes the stairs are a lot to deal with but it’s a great workout and with the price it’s something your willing to do. Many trips you can organise very quickly as they come to your hotel to sort this out and prices aren’t too expensive either. Cleaning was spot on, pool staff lovely and also the restaurant too. Can’t complain. Would easily go back due to the easy and understanding of English between each other.

1447,"We stayed at the Orchidacea for two weeks and were impressed by the rooms, which are a great size, the balconies are nice and big, the bathroom was good, everything was very clean and we had no complaints at all. The bed was hard, too hard for us, so I mentioned this problem to The super helpful staff in reception and we had a softer mattress placed on top of the hard one, it was a huge improvement.All the staff were friendly and very helpful and seemed to be very happy to help at any time. We stayed in a deluxe room with a fabulous sea view. The downside of that sea view is the 150-odd steps to climb to get to the room, so we were fitter when we left than when we arrived. It was definitely worth the climb though, and if you are lucky, the great guys who drive the ute will be around the lower car park area and will offer to drive you up to the top car park. From there it is a flat walk to your room.The location of the hotel is good, at the far end of Kata Beach. It is nice and quiet but also very close to the shops and dining options. There are three restaurants right at the beach, all serving good value reasonable food and they are are all just a two minute walk from the hotel.On our first night we ate at the hotel. The food was ok but very expensive - more than we would pay in Australia - $70 for two meals and two drinks. The restaurants at the beach are more like $20 for the same. Breakfast at the hotel was ok but nothing to write home about. The same stuff is offered every day.The pool was very nice - we were there during low season and it was nice to have the pool to ourselves occasionally. I can imagine that it would get crowded quite quickly during high season.All in all this is a good hotel and we would stay there again. Wifi in the rooms is excellent and the surroundings are nice. Just over the hill is the smaller Kata Noi beach and you can get dropped off there by the hotel's ute twice a day. Kata beach is very nice and also safe for swimming - safer than Karon and probably Patong beach too.","September 30, 2018","25    Orchidacea Resort - Kata Beach, Phuket

1452,"WOW! They say Thailand is the land of smiles, and this is 'the Hotel of Smiles'! My husband and I have just returned from a 2 week stay at this lovely hotel and it was one of our best holidays! The first thing you see is the huge opulent gold urn on the front wall. You are given a lovely welcome refreshing juice at reception that also has a koi pond near it. The staff are so friendly and welcoming as well as extremely helpful and informative about what is around the area and things to do. The resort is set on a hillside with beautiful lush gardens full of orchids and jasmines that filled the air with their beautiful scent and other tropical flora and trees that are meticulously cared for by gardeners. You can see some lovely birds and lizards around the grounds, we even saw a humming bird/sunbird whilst walking around. There is also a little river that goes through the left side of the resort and as it's on a hillside it has breathtaking views of the long beautiful sandy beach of Kata and the crystal blue Andaman Sea. The rooms are built in blocks on various levels on the hillside with steps up to all the blocks and the higher the rooms, the better sea views. There is a bellboy service who can drive up a small road in the middle of the resort to some of the higher room blocks. We had a lovely standard room which was spotlessly clean, then the hotel kindly upgraded us to a superior room which was brilliant! It was so spacious and again, spotlessly clean! There are so many extras that we were not told about by our UK travel agent. Both rooms had in-room safes as well as a safe at reception. They supply both beach and pool towels free of charge. There are lovely urns of fresh water around the grounds for guests to wash their sandy feet from the beach....there are designated smoking areas....all these little extras show how much they care for the resort and its cleanliness! The rooms were serviced daily and so so clean, the bathroom tiles and glass were gleaming and even the balconies were spotless! The bathroom had lovely shower gel and shampoo and the superior room had a hand held shower as well as a rain down shower! Complimentary bottled drinking water is supplied in the rooms and you can ask for more if you need, and there is coffee and tea facilities as well as a fridge. There are even 2 complimentary postcards for guests, so no panic to shop to buy cards quickly! The bed was so large and comfortable too and of course all rooms have air-conditioning. The pool is a good size and again, very clean with plenty of sun beds and there are showers and changing facilities too as well as a pool bar where you can have drinks and food. Nana, who works at the pool bar is a delight to chat with, so happy and helpful! There is also a gym and a spa next to the pool area. The hotel has a free bus shuttle to Kata Beach driven by one of the 3 lovely Bellboys, who go out of their way to help, sorry I forgot their names, but they were super! We chose this hotel because of the lovely flora in the photographs, and because Kata and Kata Noi beaches have the cleanest blue waters but when we got there and saw how lovely Orchidacea is and saw the other hotels around, we were so glad to have chosen Orchidacea. Orchidacea is a little gem and in a brilliant location, just across the road about 200 metres from the long sandy clean beach of Kata. And if you go opposite up the hill, you can walk to Kata Noi beach which is smaller and quieter but with the same beautiful clean sandy beach. Breakfast is a beautifully presented buffet served from 06:30-10:30 in the Sanderana restaurant on the same floor as reception and has such a vast choice for every tastebud! You have a selection of cereals and juices, tea, coffee. There is always a rice dish and noodle dish and on one occasion even beef casserole! So for those that brunch rather than breakfast+lunch, it's perfect! There is ham and sausages and bacon as well as a live cooking station that prepares made-to-order omelettes and fried eggs. There is a vast salad selection and also a choice of breads/toast and jams and honey, and a choice of fresh fruit including papaya, water melon and pineapple. The staff are always refilling everything and making it look so lovely. The superb Rothschildiana restaurant is on the lower level and it serves the best freshly prepared food we have had! We even asked to meet and congratulate the chef, the presentation and care of each course served is wonderful, the salad served in half a pineapple looks wonderful, and the desserts are mouthwatering! There is a Thai and Western menu so again, something for everyone. We had booked half-board with our UK travelbag but were wrongly told that food was a buffet and variety of Thai and Western, but when we got there, the 'half-board' menu was a single set menu with no cold drinks, just tea or coffee. I have some food allergies so some of the meals were not suitable for me. Even though the mistake was our UK travel agent's, the waiter Dillop went out of his way to sort it and to accommodate us, which was excellent service, especially as our rep. Mr Bonus didn't even bother to come to meet us. Thank you Dillop! All the staff at Orchidacea are all sooooo friendly and helpful. We had some great tips and information from Michael, New, and Marco at reception, and when my husband wasn't feeling well one evening, Marco accompanied us to the shop opposite to help get his medicine......thank you so so much Marco for helping. All the staff were friendly, from the superb house keeping staff to the gardeners, and I am sorry I don't remember everyone's names. Everything always looks so neat and tidy and clean, even after a night of very heavy rain, the gardeners were up early clearing all the broken plants and tidying up. I think Orchidacea will be closed for a few weeks for maintenance in May but would definitely recommend it. It was a brilliant holiday made special by the lovely staff at this outstanding resort! Thank you Orchidacea for making our first Thailand holiday so special and memorable for us! Linda & Bill","April 29, 2018","25    Orchidacea Resort - Kata Beach, Phuket

The resort is something different amidst the architecture and landscape that sets it apart from the modern looking hotels around it. The room we had was the Premium Suite and it was a good choice made. The living room was spacious, the bedroom was cozy and clean. The restroom had a separate shower and bath tub which was perfect for us. There's the balcony that connects to the living room and bedroom which was nice. We could see the beach from where we stood. The Big Buddha was visible from our room. It is only a short distance walk to our preferred Kata Noi beach but the resort offers shuttle to Kata Beach for its guests. The breakfast spread was adequate with pastries, fruits, pancakes and french toasts. Of course you'll still have your cereals, ommelettes and others. Our rooms were cleaned everyday and I'm very happy with the service and hospitality provided by the ever smiling staffs in the resort. The swimming pool was clean and maintained well although we didn't spend too much time there. There's a lot of shops and restaurants very close to the resort where you can easily find restaurants for seafood, Thai, Italian, Indian and burger joints. The resort was quiet and peaceful at night and doesn't have too much noise pollution even though it was close to the main road. Checking in was a breeze and I didn't have much issues getting to our rooms although there's some effort that needs to be taken climbing up the flights of stairs throughout the resort. I'm happy with my stay here in Orchidachea Resort and will definitely come back for my next visit to Phuket. ","April 9, 2018","25    Orchidacea Resort - Kata Beach, Phuket

1457,"We upgraded our room to deluxe seaview, so glad we did. Our room was at the very top with wonderful views. We were concerned about getting to and from the room, no problem as you only had to ask the bell boys and you will be driven to the top in an open backed seated truck. It was easy to walk down from the high rooms to reception and breakfast, also the hotels pool.I would recommend the elderly to request a lower room and pay for the upgrade, a bit pricey but worth it. These rooms are spacious with a safe and coffee/tea making facilities.The room cleaning daily was excellent, the breakfast was also very good with ample choices. The swimming pool and bar come snack service was also very good and reasonably priced.Reception and all staff were very friendly and helpful and always very pleasant and polite. Only a couple of British people in the hotel, which is a shame, need to encourage more.The hotel is between the two beach areas on a steep incline, a few minutes walk into the main area and beaches.We did not use the hotel restaurant for evening meals, those that did said it was value for money, and the food good and plentiful. We like to eat out in the towns restaurants and trying different ones.Would I return, yes I would, even though the steps puff you out.

The beach was a short walk from the hotel, maybe a couple of minutes (if that). Located around plenty of restaurants and shops.

1461,Hotel is a great location at the top of the town you can walk down to shops bars restaurants and beach all within 5-10 mins walk. Granted lots of steps due to this being on a hill however bell boy on hand if you need a lift to the higher rooms ( we arrived late and left early and the service was available) Request a lower floor room if you have difficulty with steps the view may not be as great. We found the staff at the hotel very helpful indeed. Breakfast plenty of choice freshly made omelettes toast preserves Thai food pastries. Pool was very nice plenty of sun beds with thick matteresss which was fab. Room cleaned daily free water tea coffee fridge which was very useful for keeping your beers cool and milk for your early morning brews.

1463,"* If you want a relaxing atmosphere DON'T COME HERE! The hotel is full of rules, regulations & punishments, displayed on laminated notices everywhere. Some examples are: 10 rules for using the pool, don't take the free bottles of water out of your room, don't drink the foot-washing water (!), don't flush used toilet paper down the loo, but put it in the bathroom bin (disgusting! especially if you have diarrhoea!), a 3000Baht fine (£60) if you store & cook raw meat & seafood in your room, more fines if you damage or steal anything from your room. You're not allowed to take food out of the breakfast buffet - we were told off in no uncertain terms by sour-faced Maria cos we'd taken a drop of milk for cups of tea in our room. This rule meant I had to leave in the restaurant the cake they'd made for my birthday & never saw it again.*If you expect your ""deluxe"" room to be luxurious, DON'T COME HERE! It's a bit bigger than the basic rooms, but no sign of the towel sculptures or flowers scattered on the bed as shown on the hotel website. There aren't even enough drawers to store your small stuff.* If you're looking for a beautiful setting, DON'T COME HERE!The hotel's on a small corner site at the junction of 2 noisy traffic-choked roads. OK, there may be views of the sea from some of the rooms - IF you peer between the other nearby hotels & the poles festooned with electric cables. And the view from the hotel restaurants is of a part-demolished building - lovely!*If you have a mobility problem, DON'T COME HERE!As well as the flights of steps to reach all the rooms, mentioned by other reviewers, there are mini-steps (1""-3"" high) to get into your room, & to the different areas in the room - a tripping hazard.* If you like a pleasant stroll from the hotel in the evening (or the day) DON'T COME HERE!There's no continuous pavement - where it peters out on your side you either walk along the top of the street drains, or take your life in your hands & try to cross the road to the next stretch of pavement, between all the motor bikes, mini-buses, cars & taxis.*If you're looking for other Brits to chat to, DON'T COME HERE!We met one other couple, otherwise it's ""Moscow-on Sea"". We saw one Russian lady at breakfast pick up a muffin, put it right up to her nose to sniff it, then put it back. Yuk!WHAT ELSE CAN I SAY? Some of the staff are friendly, especially Marco & Michael at Reception, & Dilip in the Rothschildiana restaurant. The Thai staff are mostly pleasant but their English is pretty limited. The hotel food & drinks are good & reasonably priced, especially if you take advantage of the Happy Hour & other deals, the weather's hot & sunny & the pool is warm.","February 25, 2018","25    Orchidacea Resort - Kata Beach, Phuket

1464,"We came to Orchidacea Resort completely spontaneously after being let down by a hotel close by that had been ‘overbooked’. After booking last minute online, we went over to Orchidacea and explained we had only just booked so unfortunately the booking had not gone through to them yet. We were asked to sit down and wait for 20 minutes which we didn’t mind at all, we received a welcome drink for the wait which was a nice touch! The room was spacious, clean, had a lovely view of both the beach and pool and the pool itself was beautiful! I think the hotel itself could do with a little revamp but they definitely deserve to be a 4* resort. We are so thankful we didn’t end up staying at our first planned hotel!!

Great breakfast but at times a little chaotic at the egg station - it's only a small gripe.

We initially stayed in a room on the first floor but the rooms on the ground floor had a plunge pool attached so we thought of updrading ourselves for rest of our stay. The Hotel staff managed to arrange one room even though the hotel was sold out.The room size was decent along with the bathroom.The swimming pool of the property was also beautiful and the bar serves good cocktails. The property is huge and the restaurant serves good food.Though not on the beach but a mere 5 minutes walk will lead you to the beach.Not to be missed - the thai massage at the resort itself.

1518,"My travel agent booked the wrong room on my behalf in error. I was meant to have a deluxe room with jacuzzi but ended up with only a deluxe room, but at no fault of the hotel as it finally transpired. I was initially pretty disappointed with the explanation offered by the reception girl until Zaki (the senior manager) intervened. Zaki was able to fully explain the regrettable circumstances and to ease an otherwise heated situation.Zaki's professionalism was much appreciated and he was a gentleman and a complete professional. This part of my review is only written with the view to thank Zaki.More importantly, the hotel is well run, clean and friendly. As previous reviews highlight, it is in an ideal location and it has a great backdrop of the surrounding hills.Tuk Tuks are easily obtained at the end of the street and for 200 Bart you can get to Bangala Rd or Jung Ceylon.The main pool is clean and the bar staff are friendly. The happy hour is very good value for money. The hotel provides beach towels, thongs and beach bag including an umbrella. The deluxe rooms are of a high standard and very well cleaned each day by friendly and accommodating staff.Any traveler thinking of a mid-priced room for 2 weeks would be well advised to put Deevanna at the top of their list for consideration.From a rough start to a happy conclusion I could not recommend Zaki and his hotel more highly.","June 23, 2019","26    Deevana Patong Resort & Spa

The staff are beyond rude in the restuarant including the F&B manager/supervisor. I asked for a romantic table to be set up as i wanted to buy champagne and propose. Was told thatbif i dont pay 2500THB that she will never do that. Was told that they were going to uprade us to a different room. Only to find it would be closer to the entrance and exact same room (1038). Entrance to our room is via a corridor where they clear out the rubbish ( see images) backnof the kitchen area. Absolutely pathetic. You pay for Ice, even if you collect it from reception. The manager never once made contact with me even after my agent got hold of them.

1527,"We arrived here for a 10 night stay in a Junior Suite with Jacuzzi. The room itself was pleasant; however a bit dark. We have since been advised these rooms will be receiving a renovation in the next couple of months. Our housekeeper Jaed was lovely and friendly. Most days she prepared small animals out of towels or tissue paper. We knew the days she wasn't working as the staff didn't replenish toilet tissue, leave small towels or even clean our coffee mugs. That was disappointing.Overall, the hotel has a great deal of trainees - all lovely, but unless any of the staff are middle or senior management, you have no chance of requesting basic items (such as hot food for breakfast - bacon, eggs, a laundry bag, following up your laundry at 8pm). Senior Management must include basic English as part of their training programme.There are so many inconcistancies with the complimentary/discounted vouchers we were provided with on check in. If it wasn't for Aski, we would have left the hotel prior to our scheduled date. This comes back to lack of understanding from staff - basic English would have rectified these issues.One such voucher was a % discount as stated and advised what it wasn't available to use on. I purchased a cup of tea from the coffee shop and handed over my voucher to be told I couldn't use it here - it was only for the main cafe. I had previously used it at the garden pool, the Thai restaurant upstairs and the main cafe. Nowhere in this voucher does it say I cannot use at the coffee shop. To make matters worse, Aski had left for the day and the other front manager told me I couldn't use it!!!!The ladies at the garden pool were friendly and helpful at all times - thanks ladies.Overall, this is a lovely hotel, Aski is certainly the glue that has kept on top of our concerns/issues. Look out as I'm sure other big name hotel groups will be chasing him. Thank you Aski","June 16, 2019","26    Deevana Patong Resort & Spa

1532,"We stayed for 4 nights from the 24th March, we loved it! Yes it is secluded and that is part of it's charm. The resort offers free bikes and free kayaks, you can get to the 7-11 by either in not much time. Our studio room was huge with a very lofty ceiling and we thought very good value for money. The resort is barefoot rustic style, very peaceful and relaxing atmosphere. They offer shuttles twice daily, usually to phuket town area for a charge of 100 bahts pp. They also offer free shuttle to the nearby Cove Resort which is a lovely place. We used our bikes to get to a seafood restaurant in one direction for a meal and the beach bar ans restaurant the other (this route is a bit hilly). Both were very enjoyable. There is a taxi place right across the road And we got one to kata beach for 600 bahts and then back from patong for 700 bahts. Patong is way too busy. Kata slightly less busy and Karon was more relaxed. We still prefered staying at the Mangrove however! Tip: if you book a double rather than a twin this seems to be twin beds with a mattress topper on top. Great if you prefer a softer mattress. I'd stay here again on a heartbeat.

1533,"A beautiful, secluded hotel in what seems like your own paradise, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay at The Mangrove. We stayed in studio room which had a very large comfy bed a balcony overlooking the resort and mountains. The view truly was 5-star with the Big Buddha and the surrounding hills reflected in the water. The grounds are stunning with the restaurant overlooking the pool and gardens and a view of all the aforementioned, as well as the body of water that this sits next to. There is a small beach and kayaks so you can go exploring. Also a hut for Thai massages which were described as ‘soooo good’ by my fiancé. We had many a night in the pool during happy hour watching the sunset collapse behind the hills. Whilst these views and grounds are outstanding, this is very much a 3-4 star hotel at its core. The food in the restaurant varies between great and ok, nothing outstanding as far as we could tell which led us to use food delivery apps a few times on our stay. SIDE NOTE: The hotel offers a shuttle to ‘The Cove’, a restaurant about 15 mins drive away. The food and atmosphere here was brilliant and appropriately priced. 300 baht for a taxi back though. The inclusive breakfast was a nice perk but there weren’t many options, often serving a lot of rice and stir fry dishes which I couldn’t stomach first thing. There is a variety of fresh fruit and an omelette station as well, I guess it’s down to taste! It’s worth noting that this resort is somewhat secluded and you are a 15 minute walk away from the nearest 7/11 so if you want big bottles of water to stay hydrated through the heat, you’ll need to take a walk or borrow a bike. The hotel did provide us with 600ml bottles when requested. When the room was cleaned, we returned to a quick brush over, bed made (not fresh sheets), change of bins and towels and new bottles of water. Not a proper clean and no additional soaps or shampoo for the bathroom. Due to the position of our room (next to reception) we had a small amount of light coming in from outside. The blinds do a good job if blocking this out but the room is far from pitch black. This would only relate to a couple of rooms though. All in all, this resort was a real find and absolutely fantastic value for the money. If you want a chilled out atmosphere away from the hustle and bustle of the rest of Thailand, this will suit you well. Take a few books, play some chess and enjoy some cocktails. Just bear in mind that there are not many frills included. ","March 20, 2019","27    The Mangrove Panwa Phuket Resort

1536,"We booked 4 rooms for 2 nights and was told the hotel is over booked. My bro has too moved to their sister's company 2 km away. And then asked checked back in again on the second day. We are not happy with the overbooked situation handled in the hotel and they decided to give him an hour complimentary massage for a couple. While we went for the massage, masseus wasn't happy about the 1 hr complimentary massage. They were complaining and ended our massage for 50 minutes with complains, chats and insincere service very simple touch massage. Please be reminded there are ""farang"" who knows Thai language as well. The massage area has no privacy, people just walk in to the hut talking and watching the masseus work. Nothing is nearby the resort, you have to travel 1.7 km away to a 7-11 convenient shop. The establishment it self average. But the services needs to brush up. There are plenty of room for improvement. ","February 6, 2019","27    The Mangrove Panwa Phuket Resort

I had a great holiday at Cape Panwa Hotel in 2013 so booked this resort thinking it was near the village but it isn't … The resort food was relatively cheap but inconsistent. Free breakfast but not a great breakfast offering. No beach here, just mangroves and free kayaks and equipment were old and not serviceable. ","August 6, 2018","27    The Mangrove Panwa Phuket Resort

Yo can actually swim in the waters around the hotel, which we did, we went canooing and enjoyed the pool every day.

1545,"Located away from the main tourist areas the Mangrove Panwa is a great location for people that prefer a quieter scene. The facilities are quiet nice and pricing is very affordable. Unfortunately the privatr beach area isn't that nice around July but I am sure it is better during the high seasons.Pool and garden area offers a relaxing and quiet place to spend evenings while watching the moon and stars in full view of the ocean. However as the resort is located in a bay, the sea is dark with little to no reflection. Venturing slightly north would likely offer a better view.Location also allows access to Phuket town with ease than more touristy areas like Patong Beach where prices for anything are higher. Overall a very relaxing and tranquil experience. The down side is that car travel is required to go anywhere as there is almost nothing around the area.

The resort is far away from anywhere and anything and Grab cabs can take anywhere from 15 - 40 minutes to reach the resort, however, they are easily available.We had two bungalows and were more than impressed by the doubt and twin rooms. One features a jacuzzi. The grounds at the hotel are lovely and the resort is serviced with a large swimming pool and a bar / restaurant that is opened late. The menu is quite limited however. The staff here are lovely too. I will note though that the beach here is disgusting. It really isn't a beach at all but a tidal bay. If the beach was beautiful, as many are in Thailand, this would be a perfectly relaxing resort. However, if you want to go to the beach, or a bar or restaurant, it is a bit of an effort.","July 11, 2018","27    The Mangrove Panwa Phuket Resort

Room was pretty good, bed was hardish and had a lovely mosquito net all the way around the bed, it actually has a little kitchen too which is cute! Location of this resort was our problem, we couldn’t hire a scooter from them as their policy is you much have an international drivers licence to hire. And he couldn’t tell me where to hire out of the hotel. It’s not really near much, the closest 7/11 is 1.4km away. There are push bikes you can borrow for free, along with kayaks and paddle boards. The grounds are nice with giant chess, a long pool and rabbits in pens.. Nice if you just want to chill at the resort for sure!

1555,"Firstly, Cape Panwa is far superior compared to the other areas on the west of the island.The apartment we had was 303, and we stayed for 2 weeks. The service from the staff was outstanding, always polite and always really nice drinks and authentic food. The area itself is magnificent, just so calm and relaxing. You do have to get everywhere by taxi however it really isn't too dear and is a preferred way to travel as opposed to hiring a car and the risks that are involved. The price we paid for the room was exceptional and was in great condition with a lovely big terrace on it. Having a shower with the doors open was very freeing experience! I wouldn't recommend this place for those with children because it is more of a relaxation retreat/ couples destination. Overall, the staff were so helpful, the breakfast was fantastic, the area and location was idyllic and the rooms were very clean and tidy. Would recommend !

Mosquito spray (lifesaver) is also included in the room, as well as a large bag to carry all your stuff to the pool, very useful!The room was a good size for 2 people, plenty of power outlets for charging, lots of seating, good sized wardrobe.The hotel itself is fantastic, we stayed right at the top of the hill, by the reception, there are about 30 stairs leading down to the pool and restaurant, these can be a bit of a challenge in the dark after a few cocktails, so request to stay at the bottom if you think this would bother you.The grounds are lush green, you are practically in the jungle, the swimming pool is a good size for the number of guests they have here, in front of the hotel is the sea, as the name suggests there are mangroves under the water, so not recommended for swimming! They have kayaks to borrow for use at high tide, great fun! The restaurant is open air, reasonably priced, and very nice, we didn't have a bad meal there.They have a good selection of cold press juices (120B) smoothies (100-120B) cocktails (199B however BOGOF between 13:00-14:00 and 18:00-19:00 perfect for meal times)There are massages available, we didn't partake, so can't comment.They have bicycles to borrow, as well as scooters and cars to hire. The hotel is 1.5km from the nearest shop, there is a small market there too, but mostly selling fresh meat and fish.The staff are fantastic, always greeted with a smile, a special mention to Fern, Kon, and Aom all 3 couldn't be more helpful, and make a mean cocktail!The drive from the airport is around an hour, and should cost ~1000B We had a very relaxing stay here, and would recommend it to anyone.","March 21, 2018","27    The Mangrove Panwa Phuket Resort

Fab location next to pool, beach and restaurant but jacuzzi wasn't quite up to what we expected. Took ages to fill and if you have mobility problems then this is not for you as too deep to easily step in/out of and no seat to sit on only bottom of Jacuzzi. Food good but bottled beer expensive, hence the 4 star rating!What made this place outstanding was the way they assisted us when our camera got left in the taxi at the airport coming home. The driver returned it to the hotel, they offered to bring it to the airport but unfortunately it was too late as is was too far away. However , before getting payment from us, they sent our camera back to us and we got it back a week after returning home.

1560,"We stayed at the Mangrove while attending a wedding in the Panwa district. Panwa is a remote district, and there are few things to do near the resort. If you want to get anywhere (restaurants, massage etc.), your best bet is to call a transportation company. (I applaud all those who rent their own car and drive around: there are no road signs, no traffic laws, and everyone weaves in and out of traffic at all times...). The Mangrove is beautiful and serene, I'll let you read the other reviews for a better description of the resort itself, the only reason it didn't get 5 stars is due to an unfriendly and shady receptionist. The receptionist has an agenda for you, she wants you to visit certain restaurants and hire certain drivers, and she didn't even hide the fact that she's upset when we went with a different (cheaper, more reliable) driver than the one she had insisted upon. Later on, we learned that she gets a rebate from the vendors she recommends (no surprises there). And, for the record, the restaurant she lrecommended"" us for dinner had no price on their menu (BIG RED FLAG). Please be warned to use your own driving company and go to a restaurant of your own choice when you visit Mangrove. Otherwise, it's an absolutely delightful resort.

1562,"Firstly, I wouldn’t say this place was a resort as such. It’s a very quiet place with little or no atmosphere and the restaurant is fairly small and limited. We stayed over Christmas and felt a little let down, there was a big Christmas tree and staff were wearing hats but that was it. There wasn’t much of an atmosphere and the hotel didn’t cater much to Christmas unlike similar hotels close by. The staff were amazing and food at the restaurant was good! Breakfast really could be improved! The rooms were exceptionally clean and so was the pool and the bunny area was cute (although slightly odd). We loved the free use of paddle boards and kayaks - great little touch! We had a bungalow with an outdoor jacuzzi bath which we were really excited to use but it was a tad old and the tap was falling off and the water ran so slow it took around 30 min to fill. Unfortunately renting motor bikes here is the same as any hostel in Asia - you rent a bike with an empty tank and then struggle up the hill to get o the petrol station. This is normally fine and we are used to it after travelling Asia for three months but we didn’t expect it at a hotel that costs almost £100 per night and when the rental price is double what it would be in a hostel. This place is good if you want to completely get away from everyone and everything for a few days. Overall we had a lovely experience but felt a few little things could of been altered to make this place more special! It just missed the little touches and the added extras.

1563,"Me and my partner came to Phuket for both a relaxing and sightseeing holiday. Our hotel was perfect for both. Although the hotel is about 30/45 minutes away from Phuket town, the local taxis are cheap enough and we enjoyed being able to relax at the hotel as Cape Panwa is the quieter part of Thailand compared to somewhere like Patong. Our room was clean and comfortable, although we did notice that the maids were cleaning rooms with the front door open, despite the hotel advising to keep all of our windows and doors shut to avoid insects getting in. We did have a gheko lizard and a beetle in our room at points during the holiday, but the staff managed to catch them after we failed to do so! The food is simple but reasonably priced and has a bit of variety similar to what you find in Phuket town. The staff are extremely friendly, always saying good morning, and generally having a chat and always try and help if you need it. Me and my partner had to unexpectedly extend our stay for 3 more days, but luckily the hotel were kind enough to accommodate this and we didn't even need to switch rooms. They were very understanding of our situation after my partner wasn't very well, and asked how he was every morning since our extended stay. The pool area can be quite busy but there's always plenty of room around the pool or in the bar area. The pool is cleaned regularly and is a perfect place to cool off after a hot day! Not really sure why people are complaining about the beach, yes it isn't your typical Thailand beach, but the hotel offers free kayaking and paddle boarding and is a beautiful location for watching the sunset in the evenings and for late night walks. If you had a perfect Thailand beach at the back of your hotel, you would never want to leave and explore! They have a great selection of drinks, alcoholic or not, and the bar staff too are friendly and welcoming. Overall we are extremely pleased with our stay, the only thing we could comment on is the insects that had gotten into our room but as long as you keep your bedroom mosquito net up and your suitcases closed you won't have any problems! Just to highlight one member of staff Kon (trainee waiter) is a credit to the team and you would never of known he was a trainee! ","November 24, 2017","27    The Mangrove Panwa Phuket Resort

1565,"Maybe we lucked out, our room 307 illuminated all night (like daylight) by windows which were unable to be shuttered to keep out the light. Added to this was the noise created by the staff in reception. Breakfast was ordinary, 1 morning the hot food had no burners under them to keep them warm so everything was cold and the little chicken sausages were floating in cold water. Certainly a potential health issue in the tropics. I tried to give the hotel feedback at time and they said I should write a letter on the single piece of paper left in the room. On a more positive note the room design and access to our own balcony was great. The grounds were quite and appeared to be well cared for. Thoughtful ideas from the hotel was the beach bag, torch, insect repellant and umbrella in room. I wouldn't recommend to anyone who cannot do stairs...the local evening market 1.5kms away was a good place to try local street food.","October 17, 2017","27    The Mangrove Panwa Phuket Resort

1566,We are South Africans who visited The Mangrove at the beginning of our trip to Thailand. The staff is very friendly and greeted us with a smile. They were also very helpful when we wanted to book our trip to Koh Samui. Rent a scooter and you can explore the whole of Phuket for cheap. There is a nice beach to swim at in front of The Ship restaurant. They also have good prawns by the way...The Chalong Bay rum cocktails at The Mangrove bar is extremely good and it is nice to support this local producer.The rooms were modern and very clean.

1567,"The hotel is quite nice. It's in a very, very quiet corner of the island with no bars, restos or nightlife about. The bed was fantastic! We slept like logs and the room was pretty good overall.One complaint. We checked out at 3 am and were charged 100 baht for some mosquito spray that never was in the room. We actually had two rooms and one room had the spray, one didn't. Manager - please when a guest has spent 15,000 baht over 4 days and is leaving at 3 am, let's not make him open up his packed suitcases at 3 am to look for the spray that costs 25 baht in 7/11.The breakfast could be improved. Chicken sausages need to be banned from Thailand as I'm sure they're made out of recycled flip flops. It's the same with the bacon, this bacon looks like it's has been nuclear tested. The omelettes are great.","August 19, 2017","27    The Mangrove Panwa Phuket Resort

1568,"The Mangrove is a great place to relax from an intensive backpack holiday. its a rather small resort with 30-something rooms so it is very quiet. The rooms (bungalows) are really spacious and it feels like you are in your private resort. it breathes a romantic athmosphere. However this tranquility comes at a price. You are literally in the middle of nowhere. if you want to go to the nearest beach (ea yon beach), the hotel offers a shuttle, but is doesn't bring you back to the resort and the taxi drivers know this. Patong beach is actually out of the question when you don't want to pay the jackpot on taxi fees. Still we didn't came here to experience the crowded patong beach and thats why i would still give it 4 points. For the adventurous people: take the free bike and go down towards the 7/11 for your groceries (saves you a lot on drinks) and at night you can visit the food market across the 7/11. you can buy some cheap and good streetfood. and its a really local happening.","August 10, 2017","27    The Mangrove Panwa Phuket Resort

1569,"The resort is quite far from the city and nothing surrounding there, recommend to have a car. We choose this resort, cos it is only 20 minutes to Asia Marina Port by car. we stayed at Stuido room with ocean view. so it is the first roll on the beach. Good chilling by sitting at balcony or outdoor jucuzzi tub. The price is not that expensive comparing to the room that we get. The breakfast is nice, not much selection , but nice taste. The beach is not clean for swimming, cos there are many mangroove tea. but Nice watching Sunset. beautiful. the resort is cute, there are many cute rabbit to play. however, from the lobby to the villa. there are many step and it is difficult if your luggage is big. walk like 8 minutes from the beach to lobby.

1570,"The Mangrove hotel is amazing, and I would recommend for anyone to stay there. By far the most enjoyable period of our 2 week trip to Thailand. My girlfriend and I stayed at the Mangrove for 2 nights before extending our stay for another night. We stayed in the studio villa with an ocean view. The rooms are spacious and impeccably clean, and the bed is one of the most comfortable I've slept in. The bathroom area is also spacious, all in all our experience was fantastic. The pool and bar area is amazing also. Pool is crystal clear, with the hotel staff working extremely hard to keep the place clean and tidy. Food and drinks were fantastic and are very reasonably priced, there are also two happy hours per day on drinks. The hotel greet travellers with a welcome pack, and they provide a very helpful guide to the area. We used this guide as a reference during our stay and we didn't go wrong once. The Hotel provide 2 shuttles daily, which change destination according to the events going on in Phuket. A few of the shuttles are free but otherwise cost 100baht (about £2) We utilised this service everyday and have some of our fondest Thailand memories from doing so. We both bought massages which were well worth the money and I would advise to anyone going to do the same. The hotel initially seems slightly out the way of the central events in Phuket however this became our sanctuary and a retreat from the fast pace of Phuket. Transport is also very convenient which meant this wasn't a problem. The Hotel staff are all beautifully kind and friendly and nothing at all seemed to be an issue for them. Assistance from staff was available whenever needed and requests were completed within minutes. Staff are also very informative on Phuket and what events to not miss. They were the most friendly people we met during our entire trip to Thailand and It was almost hard to leave (explaining our decision to stay an extra night). I don't know how anyone couldn't give this place a 5 stars and we will definitely stay again when returning to Thailand. Thank you so much to all the staff at the Mangrove for making our stay an unforgettable experience!","July 4, 2017","27    The Mangrove Panwa Phuket Resort

1571,"After I had visited this place for second time. I would like to ensure everyone that, if you are seeking for a hideaway/private place in Phuket, you can't go wrong with this place. In comparison to any other resorts nearby, this place worth every penny you spent. Especially services at their M cafe & bistro (Mangmoon bar) are the second to none. K'Venus and K'Sany are very friendly and will treat you like a very special one. Room condition is perfect, never get older from the previous year I had visited.

Comfortable...The Mangrove Panwa Phuket welcomed us once again so kindly with very friendly and courteous staff - our second visit and it still felt as enthusiastic as when it was newly opened 4 years ago.We felt like special guests to all the staff, all the time. Such a fantastic contrast to the hustle and bustle of the previous few days in Bangkok.Our room was a villa type at the front of the resort, very quiet and beautiful surroundings. Inside was perfect- spacious, clean and comfortable. Outside we had a lovely view of the gardens and only a stones throw to the beach. Really relaxing accommodation and grounds.The breakfast each morning included fruits, cereals, breads, salads and traditional Thai options, as well as an egg station (great) and hot & cold drinks. Perfect start to the day eating in the open restaurant area with lovely views out over the grounds and beach. Look out for the majestic eagles flying overhead.The bar served amazing selection of local rum cocktails (chalong bay) and local beers, not to mention pretty good fresh ground coffee.The restaurant served really good food in the evening, which we could have happily had every evening. We didn't need our own transport as we were able to use the complimentary shuttle service and local taxis. Loads to explore in and around the area. We were sad to leave this little piece of paradise.

I can't help thinking if they didn't bother changing the sheets from the previous guest, yuck. Furthermore, there's a bright light outside my room that filters in through glass panes near the front door. I woke up several times during the night thinking it was early morning. Front desk said they will do something today and I hope they follow through. I can't believe that this has not been sorted out in the past. Both issues have contributed to a very poor night's sleep.

The security gate giving access to the beach were constantly stopping me to ask me for my room number and wanted me to produce my key when entering the hotel; whilst I saw couples and families walking in and out unchallenged all the time. One time, my room key was at the bottom of my rucksack and I was in a hurry, so I told security my room number and that I saw him this morning and said sawatdii ‘hello’ (I’m over 6ft and have a big beard, I thought he might remember me). The security guard got very violent, very quickly and pushed me and put his fists up to fight me. I believe in taking security seriously, but this was way over the top. I produced my key, after being grabbed and pushed a few times buy the guy, and reported it to the front desk who smiled and said they would ask the security guard what happened - like I was lying about it.

We were upgraded from a Spa deluxe room to a Private Jacuzzi room. This was lovely. Being our 20 year wedding anniversary, there was a bottle of bubbles waiting for us. The room was clean and spacious. I loved the outdoor shower. Breakfast was amazing with so much to choose from. An egg station with a chef ready to cook your eggs how you like them, plenty of hot dishes, fresh fruit and salad, pastries, yoghurt and toast. We preferred the pool on level 3 as we were always able to get a sun lounge and umbrella.

They had stayed there before so knew all about it but made sure we both booked pool access rooms which were great, large with nice bathrooms (can't understand why there large clear window in bathroom though when the first thing everyone does is keep the blinds closed) it was great to be able to walk out of your room straight into the pool. The only negative is that it does feel a bit like being in a gold fish bowl with no privacy at all as all the rooms can look down into yours, so again you have to keep curtains closed if your changing or simply resting on your bed unless you don't mind everyone watching. The gardens are kept immaculate and all the staff were extremely friendly, the breakfast had lots of choice from freshly cooked eggs to fresh fruit even salads.

We mentioned it and they said they would fix it, came back from dinner and it was ‘fixed’. Slept that night, and it was cool. Woke up, went for breakfast, came up and air con stopped working again. Was coming out warm air, complained again. And they said they would “fix it”, went back to the room and it wasn’t “fixed” complained again, and then finally got room changed, and they upgraded us. Which made us happy.You eat breakfast in your own sweat, as there is no air con. Croissant are stale, and they don’t even have cheese for your toast or anything.WiFi is shocking, I think I logged back in 35 times a day. And didn’t work by the pool.Big pool area felt like it was dirty, we spent all our time by the small pool.Can’t bring food or drink in from outside the hotel. So if we brought a big bottle of water from the shop, we couldn’t take that to the pool. You would have to buy another one, from them. Shower was crap, water that comes out the tap from the sink is pointless.We booked to the elephant place, and because it was so early morning we asked for a breakfast box, as we would miss the breakfast buffet. I told them how fussy I was, and was promised I would get croissants in mine (them nice stale ones) I got one little one. So me and my brother went to get some food from the buffet, as our transfer was late, so we would of made the buffet in the end. But they wouldn’t let us in, because we had the breakfast box. I explained I didn’t like it, and they still wouldn’t let us in. Which made no sense, because it’s a buffet - I should be able to eat as much as I want...Good things - it’s near the beach and restaurants.

1598,"Wow! What an amazing two week holiday I’ve had here! Thailand is beautiful and this hotel is a must. Breakfast was really good and lots to choose from, there was an egg station where you could choose what egg you wanted which includes an omelette which is amazing! Breakfast also included fruit, bacon, sausages, a salad bar, yogurts and lots of different pastries to choose from. The room was very big and clean it included a mini fridge you can take what you want and then your charged at the end it had a choice of beer, coke and water although you do get two free bottles of water a day which was really helpful to have. The shower was lovely had a choice of two shower heads and your given quite a few complimentary toiletries. There are two pool areas which are lovely a few days we struggled getting a sun bed, they don’t like you to reserve beds early but I would recommend it otherwise your left nowhere to sunbathe which is frustrating it would be handy if they had more beds put out. The cleaners are very good and leave the room very nice and tidy every day leaving fresh towels in the room. The room also includes a kettle with all sorts of tea and coffees there for you. The beach is a 5 minute walk away which is lovely and only 100bhat for a sun lounger which is super cheap. On arrival we met with a lady who told us about lots of different activities we chose to go to phiphi island and the elephant sanctuary which are both AMAZING and would highly recommend there amazing day outs which include a buffet lunch. The hotel doesn’t have any entertainment or a bar where you can sit and relax if you didn’t want to leave the hotel but there are endless restaurants and bars just outside the hotel. Karon has a few lively bars which are around a 10-15 min walk. If you are looking for a better night life get a tuk tuk to patong Bangla road which is 400bhat and has far to many bars to count and has better deals than Karon. Karon is a lovely place to stay the food is so cheap it’s worth looking around and not going in the first restaurant you see as we found some restaurants where you could get a meal for two including drinks for 500 bhat which is only around £11. The hotel owns a few restaurants which are just outside of the hotel and on arrival you will be given 10% discount cards for those restaurants we ate in both and they were both very good but a bit more expensive than the restaurants further out. Staff are really friendly and try and help you as much as possible there was a few times where the language barrier was difficult whilst calling the reception so would recommend going down there and speaking to somebody face to face it can be a lot easier! Over all an amazing hotel and would love to come back. I’ve attached some images of the restaurant food owned by the hotel. ","March 22, 2019","28    The Old Phuket

1599,"Stayed for 3 nights & was upgraded on arrival to a lovely jacuzzi room. The hotel is nice enough although definitely 3-4* & no more. The breakfast is really not good at all as the selection is extremely limited therefore the lady at the egg counter is totally overwhelmed with a 10-15 minute wait at the busiest times, the pool area is also far too small for a hotel of this size with beds crammed together but there is not a lot they can do about this now. I don’t mean to sound too critical as we enjoyed our stay & it is in the perfect location but just not my kind of hotel.","March 18, 2019","28    The Old Phuket

1600,"Upon arrival at the Old Phuket on our first night in Thailand we were told that a burst water pipe meant that our room was out of action so we'd have to be moved to a different hotel. I'm unsure if this was actually the case - we suspected that they'd perhaps overbooked the rooms. We were moved to a hotel down the street which appeared to be comparable. The next morning, The Old Phuket arranged collection from the other hotel and after several phone calls they turned up half an hour late. We arrived at The Old Phuket at around 11am but we weren't allowed to check in until 2pm (reinforcing my suspicion that they'd overbooked our room) but we eventually checked in to an upgraded room. They also included two dinner vouchers for a local restaurant that they'd said we could use during our stay. We redeemed one voucher without problems before going on a snorkelling trip for a few days. When we returned we checked into a different hotel for our last few days. Upon trying to redeem our second voucher at the local restaurant, the Old Phuket Restaurant Manager turned up at the restaurant and told us that our voucher was no longer valid and that we'd have to pay for the food we'd now ordered. Given the inconvenience of being relocated at midnight after a 23 hour journey, we felt it was a little unfair to later remove this compensation. Aside from this, the hotel seemed nice enough and a good location but our overall experience was tarnished by these unforeseen circumstances which we felt could have been handled better.","March 11, 2019","28    The Old Phuket

1601,"We stayed at the hotel for 7 nights in the Sino wing. It was lovely and clean, spacious rooms and bathrooms (towels could do with being replaced). The linen was crisp and clean, although the mattress is extremely hard. We found the staff very pleasant and helpful. The location of the hotel is very central and convenient to a lovely beach and all the local restaurants, shops and small market. The one issue we had, was that our room was only cleaned by housekeeping around 3pm every day, which meant we weren't able to relax and take a nap in the afternoons, and we had to ask to have our tea/coffee replenished.","March 11, 2019","28    The Old Phuket

On arrival we were told we had been upgraded and when we were shown to our room the bed had two swans made out of towels and rose petals in the shape of a heart on the bedspread and a beautiful flower arrangement. Our room overlooked the pool with a view of Big Buddha on the hill top. The staff were all very friendly and helpful. They offer 3 free trips. One to the Sunday market where we bought our gifts. One to the festival shopping centre, which is like the Trafford Centre in Manchester. Sunday night they take you to Patong but you make your own way back, which cost 400 baht (£10). My husband got a birthday cake at breakfast and everyone sang happy birthday which was a nice touch. Our maid kept the room beautifully clean and was really nice and friendly. The hotel was ideally situated for the beach and restaurants and bars. Definitely worth a return visit.","February 13, 2019","28    The Old Phuket

We had a very nice Christmas Eve dinner with entertainment. The hotel is close to very good restaurants and shops, which you pass on your way to the beach. The coffee shop was also exceptional.

1608,"I struggled with my rating on this place. I was not too pleased with it when we first arrived. The room photos I remembered seeing were colorful and the rooms looked well-designed. What we walked into was a stark white room with concrete floors, also painted white. All the linens are white as well, except for these pieces of yellow fabric they lay across the bed. It was far too much white for my taste, and it seemed so cold and bare and uninviting. I think tile flooring would honestly be a much better choice and would warm up the space a bit. Anyway, the place grew on me over time.PROS:- The hotel is close to Karon Beach. This beach is beautiful, clean and not overly crowded. You can rent chairs at that beach for about 200 baht for the whole day (not owned by the hotel).- There are many restaurants and massage places right next to the hotel on this small street that leads toward the entrance to the hotel. We ate at almost every one of them, and many of them are very good. It was nice being able to walk there every afternoon/night for lunches and dinners without needing a taxi.- It is also not a far walk down to more restaurants along the beach area as well as a ""mall"" where you can shop for souvenirs and such.- Breakfast is served at the hotel, and they had many foods available. It was good.- The pool is unique and connects to all the rooms on the first floor. There are some narrow waterways and some spots where the pool is large and open.- We were able to find chairs every time we went to the pool.- Pool towels are provided to your room each day.- The hotel put on a New Year's Eve party for all guests with appetizers, dinner, and desserts. There was live entertainment throughout the night and some games for kids.- There are DVDs available to borrow for free from the front desk.- The beds are comfortable.- They have rooms that can accommodate families (ours had a queen, a twin and twin bunk beds to sleep five).- Our kids got the stomach flu while we were on this trip, so the concrete floors (rather than carpet) were very helpful.- The resort is clean and the room was well-cleaned each day.CONS:- The hospital-ward-like decor in the room was not inviting. Too much white! - You can see stains on the white floor, which was not ideal. It's kind of gross, but also to be expected with a floor is white, I guess.- This hotel nickel and dimes you for everything. You can't even bring your own soda can to the pool or they will charge you 500 baht to do so. (We did not have a problem at any other hotel in Thailand bringing our own drinks.)- They included this big New Year's Eve dinner as part of our room rate, but then they tried to charge us extra for our kids... even though their beds were part of our room rate and they are guests of the hotel. They did change this after we confronted them about it, but this was frustrating.- At the New Year's Eve party, they advertised there would be entertainment and games. Then when you arrive, it turns out your actually have to PAY for the games. This rubbed me the wrong way. The event was expensive, and they advertised these things would be there, so I felt that should have been free to guests.- In addition, this party did not include ANY drinks. Not even soda or juice for the kids! So our rate included extra for this fancy dinner, that literally only included food. And you could not bring your own drinks, because of course, you'd be charged extra for bringing your own. We ended up buying a 1400 baht bottle of wine from them. - Our room was tucked in a corner, so our view was not great. We had a side view of the pool. Straight ahead was a white wall. This was not the best.- Our room was on the third floor, and given the cool feature of the pool, it would have been more ideal to be on the first floor where your patio leads directly to the pool. I wished we had a room on the first floor so we could easily supervise our kids from our own patio.","January 3, 2019","28    The Old Phuket

1609,"A very nice hotel situated between the beach and the main road. Three types of accommodation, Jacuzzi rooms, Sino wing and Serene wing. Sino wing is older and quieter with pool on third floor. Serene wing newer and all rooms face the pool which can be noisy at peak times. Breakfast only but Hotel has three restaurants and a Coffee bar in the Avenue leading to the beach. Both pools have snack bars serving food and alcohol. We have been back quite a few times and are never disappointed. This has been our tenth time to this Hotel and have never been disappointed. The rooms are big with King Sized beds, showers and separate baths. Air conditioned and Wi Fi throughout. The Hotel is mid way between the main road through town and the beach. You can walk out to the main road and follow the road through town and the shopping areas. This brings you back to the beach and the other entrance to the Hotel. There are nice little shops, Restaurants and massage parlours on the Avenue from the Hotel to the beach. We will be back again next year.","December 16, 2018","28    The Old Phuket

1616,"Although a big thing was made of the fact that we had been given a room in the Sino Wing, I don't know what the fuss was about. Yes, the room was very nice and quite large and the bathroom was very spacious. However, the shower was located outside in the back yard in full view of rooms in the opposite block. When making an enquiry about settling the bill the evening before we left, the receptionist was quite rude, which is very unusual in Thailand.We also asked to be included for seats in the courtesy bus going to the market at the weekend, however this was full. Not a problem but no suggestions were offered regarding alternative forms of transport. The location of the hotel was good as it was just across from the beach and a few minutes walk from bars and restaurants.There was free wi-fi but only in certain parts of the hotel and even then the service was not reliable.Would we return here?

1625,"Overall our stay was very good. There were little areas that could use some work/alterations but nothing that would stop me from returning to the hotel. We emailed a few months in advance to see if we could upgrade our room to a private jacuzzi room. We were given this free of charge which was excellent. The room was nice enough and clean. It could probably do with a bit of an update with paint etc but nothing you would worry about while on holiday. There is an outside shower in a private courtyard. I personally loved this however I was fully aware that people from the balconies behind could definitely see into the shower. Unlucky for them watching! The shower is partially covered and I believe some of the other rooms have the showers more enclosed but I'm sure if this was an issue the staff could assist. They were happy to help every time we spoke to them. Also the bath in the bedroom had a shower attached if you were a bit bashful. The rooms come with mini bar (reasonably priced), tea and coffee facilities, complimentary water and towels. Breakfast is provided and this for me was a bit of a let down. Despite finishing at 10:30am staff had a lot of the breakfast packed away by quarter past. Also trying to get a cup of coffee from the staff who were huddled in the corner was sometimes a challenge. There wasn't a huge selection of breakfast items. Lots of salad and Thai style breakfast. That being said there was always fruit, cereal, toast and the egg station. We only used the pool on the 3rd floor which was small and clean. Never used the second pool area however when we had a walk around it also looked very clean.A couple of days the cleaner never provided pool towels however we always travel with our own so it wasn't really an issue, when we advised the front desk towels were sent immediately. This was good and we appreciated their speedy response. The hotel provides a shuttle bus service to some of the local attractions/shopping areas. This needs needs to be booked in advance to ensure a space however for us this was a great benefit and also was free.The area surrounding the hotel has a number of restuarants, bars, massage parlours, tailors and shops. We would highly recommend going to Karssons Steakhouse and also Ging - Thai food. Both have excellent, friendly staff and food/drink with very competitive prices.All in all for 10 days we had a great time and would definitely stay in the area and possibly the hotel depending on deals available.

Only recommendation: we would have appreciated the opportunity to turn down the aircon.

1628,This was our second time at this resort. This time we had a pool access room which I thoughtfully recommend. I not sure if we were spoil by our time at the Dara resort at Chewang by the staff there. But at breakfast the staff did not seem as friendly. They had to be called over to refill your coffee. The area itself is great. The gym needs a total upgrade with most of the equipment old and not working. The staff at the pool area were great along with the room cleaners. Rooms were clean with no complaints except maybe insect spray left in each room for the mosquito's Just a bit more customer service training needed that's all. The resort is great. ,"September 7, 2018","28    The Old Phuket

1629,This is my second visit to this hotel my first visit was extrordinary staff were so accommidating and lovely This trip on arrival staff were more than friendly as our taxi driver dropped us off on main street .the staff were a little shocked at this we were greeted with lovely cold drinks and a cool cloth .... accommidation was perfect we have a pool access room..i talked the resort up so much back home that 2 other family members and their spouses joined us.Unfortunately this trip i am a little .. no . Very disappointed in the restaurant staff.. they stood around and did very little to make your meal there enjoyable ... they have signs up .. do not feed the birds ... great idea however if staff took plates away instead of lounging around against tables looking bored and yawning they even walked past the table and looked but did not do anything.. we were at least offered tea and coffee once ... it makes breakfast less than enjoyable .. i am not normally a complainer...just disappointed as i hyped the staff up so much to family.... the resort on a whole is fabulous and yes i will come back ,"September 2, 2018","28    The Old Phuket

1630,"We arrives 21st august and had a lovely warm greeting We decided to upgrade our room to a private jacuzzi room for a extra £120, and wasn't disappointed Beautiful, spacious rooms and the gardens in the grounds were truely beautiful Loved how close the hotel was to Karon beach and the lovely three crowns restaurant in the lane (highly recommend this place, to eat local) massage places other restaurants pharmacies little shops etc And the breakfasts were lovely I don't know why people said different Plenty to choose from and the egg station was great However !! We were disappointed with the fact we had upgraded and the jacuzzi didn't work. We had to call the maintenance man out 4 times and still it didn't work we was however over the moon with the lovely large bath and outdoor shower and also our first night there we woke with a huge puddle on the floor and all in the bathroom turned out the air con stopped working We can fault the speed as they came straight away But took 5 days to decide to move us to. New room next door The jacuzzi actually worked (thank god ) but low and behold the bath no longer did We called out maintenance again and was just told no hot water ""sorry"" The rooms were lovely and clean and all the staff nice I just hope management at the old Phuket will teach the cleaners it your door says no cleaning today and do not disturb, they won't continually ring your bell or call the room phone and ask to clean the room even tho it was cleaned the day before Again great location and facilities but I won't be staying here again Although I'm sure it was just a off 10 days and from other reviews I know it can't be all bad ","September 1, 2018","28    The Old Phuket

If your expectations are to be blown away with facilities, you will be disappointed.This hotel is modest and comfortable. The rooms look exactly like the photos, even more spacious than expected. Air con cools the room down very quickly and the bathroom and tub set up is stunning. The only annoying thing was there are no plugs beside the bed to charge your phone overnight. Loved the customer service. Breakfast was good. Try the massage places in the lane.. I enjoyed them. We also walked to the nearby Friday night market at the local temple.. it had, by far, the best quality goods we came across in thailand. Nice watches, jewellery, clothing and bags to name a few. The prices in most cases were marked so you knew you weren't getting too badly ripped off. The pool was ok. ","August 29, 2018","28    The Old Phuket

All the other staff are excellent very friendly and helpful Kay organised our shuttle from the airport and then another to Khao Lak when we left and all went off without a hitch.The resort is in an excellent location close to everything and an easy stroll to the beach. And the pool is beautiful. We will definitely be returning and next time will bring the family.,"October 17, 2017","29    Kamala Tropical Garden Hotel

1667,"This hotel is located in Kamala, which is about 10 kms from Patong. Its a nice and quiet area that has some good bars and hotels on the main highway that passes through. The hotel is tucked into one of the streets leading inside from the main highway. The entrance is somewhat discreet but is not difficult to locate. Reception is at the entrance and is manned by two able people. A lady works the day shift while a guy takes care of the night shift. Both are really helpful and can communicate well.We reached the place at around 9 pm, after a heavy night in Koh Phangan and a day long journey from Koh Samui. The rooms were ready and looked just as they are in the photos that are put by the hotel management, right down to the color of furniture and of curtains. Fridge was stocked up with beverages and some snacks. An oven and a kettle did great service over the next 5 days. Air conditioning was functioning perfectly and the linens were fresh There is a TV in every room but we seldom used it when we were there. My only complaint is that in one of the rooms, ceiling fan was positioned away from the bed and it caused some inconvenience while sleeping.Swimming pool is quite big and is clean. Its right at the center of the property and all rooms are positioned around it. Easy access is the definite advantage but some part of the pool would be visible from the rooms. The best part is that the pool is open most of the time and that is certainly a good thing as a nice dip after a long day will definitely help relax. Bathrooms were clean and the room was cleaned whenever we requested for it.I interacted with both Jim and Paul who were available in the evenings. The beach is ten minutes from the place but we didn't try it out. There are quite a number of eateries and bars on the main road and all of them are at a walking distance. This compensates for the absence of an in-house restaurant. I wish that one will be added soon to make it complete. I will recommend this place for people who are looking for a good place in a quiet location. Patong is around 10 kms from here and the drive is quite scenic. It passes through a forest area and the terrain is hilly. One will definitely need a bike/car to reach Patong.","July 17, 2017","29    Kamala Tropical Garden Hotel

1668,"We arrived at approx 11pm for our stay here, but nonetheless were giiven a warm welcome by Jim(owner) and Paul (Manager) . Settled us into our apartment and made sure we had everything we needed. We did as their is a very extensive mini bar! Any request we did have was dealt with efficiency, professionalism and the warm and genuine friendliness that is the signature of this hotel. The rooms are kept immaculately clean and the pool in pristine condition, it was like swimming in silk. Hard to believe we were right in the heart Kamala as it was so peaceful and quiet. A real oasis.Every member of staff here deserves a special mention but suffice to say we felt as if we arrived as guests but left as friends. A special thank you though to Kay for giving up her day off to come with us to Phuket Town, it was like having our own personal tour guide :-)If we could give the staff, the location and the hotel 10 stars we would.On the negative side.......we had to leave :-(","June 19, 2017","29    Kamala Tropical Garden Hotel

1669,"We stayed here for 2 weeks, as a family of three (our son is 5) and had an amazing holiday, this hotel being a big part of that. The pool, which is only a few steps away from your room, is crystal clear and great for all ages. There is a pool bar for high season and is surrounded by lovely gardens. Although the hotel is just offset the main road, there is little to no noise at all during the day or the evenings. The rooms are immaculate and contemporary, and cleaned thoroughly every day. The manager Paul was really friendly and helpful, as were all the staff. The hotel is near to some great bars and restaurants and only a 5/10 minute walk from the stunning beaches of Kamala. I would highly recommend this hotel and Kamala itself for a superb holiday in Thailand!!","May 16, 2017","29    Kamala Tropical Garden Hotel

Clean, modern, well equipped rooms, the mini bar was comprehensive and cheap, they have complimentary umberellas and rain macs for the odd showers. Very convenient for a stroll to the beach (5mins) or take the complimentary hotel shuttle bus. Close to local restaurants, bars and cafes although there is no outside noise within the hotel grounds. This place really did make our trip the holiday of a lifetime and we, a family of 3, cannot recommend it highly enough. Superb !!!","May 13, 2017","29    Kamala Tropical Garden Hotel

Nice little walk to the beach, great pool and room very cozy. Was greeted by the owners and the manager Paul which was really nice, since we were a little tired and frazzled from our delayed flight changes.

When we stayed there the hotel restaurant was not open but they provided transport to a delightful restaurant, The Deck, situated on the beach. The taxi leaves every 15 mins so we never had to wait too long. A lovely way to start the day. There are lots of nice restaurants, bars and shops nearby. We would definitely stay here again if we ever return. ","April 3, 2017","29    Kamala Tropical Garden Hotel

Breakfast is a free, short tuk tuk ride away but lovely setting over the water at 'The Deck' restaurant when you are there. Pleasant stay with my Fiancé. Not a great deal to do in the immediate vicinity but some nice restaurants and bars. After we left, they called our next hotel to get hold of us, and they posted our travel mascot (a teddy) to us!

1676,"Stayed here last March & loved it so much, we came again this year. Although it is just off the main road, you wouldn't know it. once you're in the resort, it's so quiet. Roomy chalets circle the tropical pool. It has a friendly atmosphere about it & you soon get to know the other residents too. Breakfast is a motorbike Tuk Tuk ride away from the hotel, but a free shuttle is avail. Breakfast is in a beautiful setting overlooking the beach. The Tuk Tuk is avail for a lift to & from the beach also, although it is only a ten minute walk away. You are given an old mobile phone to phone for a lift back from the beach. Would recommend it","March 6, 2017","29    Kamala Tropical Garden Hotel

1677,"Stopped off at this resort for 2 nights after Patong for some rest and recovery and it was brilliant. Huge rooms (we had a 2 bedroom) and we got good sun around the pool. Walking distance from the beach (one of the best in Phuket in my opinion - not too crowded, clean and a great place to simply spend with a book and some drinks). Remember to check the deck Restaurant out - the duck curry has a killer kick to it! ","February 11, 2017","29    Kamala Tropical Garden Hotel

So you will get to know all the guest. The staff are extremely service minded.

Also, the apartments are located around the pool, which is very covenient.The service provided by, Liz, Paul and the rest of the staff is super:-) Liz helps with everything from booking day-trips, tours and laundry service. Apartmenst are cleaned daily. We had breakfast included, which was served at a reatuarant at the beach.

1683,"We stayed here from christmas all the way to new year. It is an amazing place if you want a quiet and peaceful place to stay and need a quick five steps access to the pool from your door. Unlike other hotels the pool is open 24hrs. This place has not coffee shop or restaurant on its premises. They have a separate restaurant on the Kamala beach shore line away from the commercial crowded place. They prove shuttle service to beach and pick up back to your room. We were personally taken care of by Liz. She is an amazing person who was able to arrange tours on short notice, arrange our pickups and drop from airport. As a family we had a great time thanks to her arrangements. Also to note is that the owners of this property are are always touring the place. They take great care on this property which is why we had no complaints. The two rooms that we rented had no issues. Even in bigger properties, you would have issues with air condition, heater, kettle etc. but here everything works well and they are kept in good conditions. Patong is 15mins Tuk Tuk ride from here, if you need to go the big Pubs and go go bars and malls. It will cost you anywhere between 400THB to 600 THB. Just bargain with the driver. Return to Kamala from Patong is a big expensive. Most Tuk Tuk will quote you 1000 THB. We had to walk away from Jungceylon mall and get a Tuk Tuk.Overall this place is the best place for family even if you have kids as young as 1 year old.","January 1, 2017","29    Kamala Tropical Garden Hotel

The staff, particularly Elizabeth was very welcoming, friendly and warm. The place was big and had a swimming pool. The rooms were clean and big and there was a minibar with drinks and food and they gave us complementary drinks. The staff guided us through the necessary details which were very helpful. They has a shuttle to transport us to and from our restaurant which saved us time. They also sent us to and fro from the beach. The food can be improved, though.

One of them even borrowed his personal motor bike to make us more familiar with driving before we rented one by ourselves, but this is just a single example. The rooms are large in size, very(!) clean, have a nice charm and definitely nothing is missing, from umbrella over basic cutlery to local guides you'll find everything you need. Amazingly, the pool can be used 24 hours and the although the hotel has not a direct view to the sea, it has a spatially distinct restaurant (5 min walking distance), where you can enjoy your substantial and diverse breakfast while facing the ocean (and there are even hotel-intern drivers bringing you over there for free).","September 5, 2016","29    Kamala Tropical Garden Hotel
