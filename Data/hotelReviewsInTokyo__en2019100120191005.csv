0,"Based on location it’s a great place. Easy to access from Ueno main station or Skyliner from Narita even with suitcases. 3-4 minute walk. Rooms smallish - but standard for Japan. But clean and an efficient service all round. The hotel is in the heart of lively Ueno with cafes, bars, good restaurants and a shopping mall nearby and easy access to central Tokyo and Shibuya on Ginza lineRecommended!","June 19, 2019","0    Mitsui Garden Hotel Ueno

1,"We stayed at Mitsu Gardens Ueno Hotel for 2 nights. Glad it wasn't any longer. A so called double bed was small, put against the wall which made it difficult to get out of the bed in the ight. A desk against the window, a small bathroom. Nothing to get excited about. Check-in was efficient and friendly. As it was Golden week in Japan, we were told to arrive at breakfast early as there would be a lot of guests there. We arrived at 0650 am, the restaurant was already full and a long line already formed. We had prepaid breKfSt at booking, months prior and were not happy to queue for 30 mins or more to get breakfast. Apoarantly there was a sign at reception saying there will be delays with breakfast, but we wernt aware of this when booking and paying. We asked for a refund on Breakfast and got breakfast out. It's close to Ueno railway station, the shrines, zoo, park and there's a convenience store across the road ","May 31, 2019","0    Mitsui Garden Hotel Ueno

2,"The hotel is very conveniently placed near to Ueno Station and also the Skyliner station which we needed to use at 6.20 am back to the airport on our final day. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful. Check in and out were easy. I had booked the Sakura panda room as a final treat for our last 3 days in Tokyo. The room was a good size (by Tokyo standards!) as was the bathroom. The Sakura panda room was super cute and made us smile. The room was clean and fresh and I liked the little extra touches such as the samples of Shisiedo products, the hair straighteners and free water. The room was cleaned and made up each day. There were two lifts, which, as this is quite a large hotel, were very useful. The hotel was mainly quiet in the room where were were situated and we slept well. We both struggled with the unusual pillows so it would have been good to have had a choice of pillows in the room. Breakfast was quite expensive given that neither of us eat Asian food for breakfast (although we like it at other times of the day). I just had cereal and croissants and my daughter ate very little. This is quite usual for Japan but we would have liked a bit more choice of continental breakfast. Overall I would highly recommend this hotel. ","April 17, 2019","0    Mitsui Garden Hotel Ueno

4,"The Mitsui Garden hotel is a popular (and therefore busy) 3 star establishment, very conveniently located about 50m from Exit 1 of the Ueno station complex. This means that it is possible to arrive from Narita Airport straight to Ueno and then carry or roll your luggage under one covered roof without needing additional transport or assistance. It is a few hundred metres from the arrival platform and there are a couple of small flights of stairs without lifts but it’s pretty convenient.Other than its location as a good base to explore Tokyo, the hotel is clean and modern with all necessary facilities in the rooms and refrigerated drinks dispensers on each floor. The staff speak good English and will also store your luggage whilst you go out sightseeing before check-in or after check-out and operate a service to forward your luggage to your next destination if you don’t want to carry it for a fee of around USD 18 per case. This is particularly useful if your next destination is Hakone which involves about 5 changes of public transport.On the down side, in common with many Japanese hotels, the rooms are small. Breakfast is mainly Japanese plus a few items such as croissants and sausages. The dining room, which doubles as an Italian restaurant in the evening is relatively small and a wait can be expected at peak times in the morning. On balance, to be recommended.","March 26, 2019","0    Mitsui Garden Hotel Ueno

5,We are staying in a semi-double room. Bed size is fine. Good location and convenient. Just less than 10 minutes walk and convenient store nearby. Panasonic hair dryer and nanocare were perfect. Steam the face anytime. Room is bigger than other Tokyo city hotel. Really expressive. The worst thing is pillow is too thin use for one. Two pillows are too high. For my past experience stayed at Sapporo Mitsui Garden did not have this problem.,"March 8, 2019","0    Mitsui Garden Hotel Ueno

6,"Plus:1. Very good location, with Ueno Station just opposite. About 30 min train ride to Shinjuku and Shibuya.2. Room size was just nice, I would think that it’s slightly bigger than other Japanese hotels that I had stayed in the past. 3. Friendly and helpful front desk. Minus:1. Bed was slightly sinking and pillows were flat.. ouch, my neck..2. But of all things, this left the deepest impression on me.. the toilet floor was dirty and it reeked of pee smell..","February 22, 2019","0    Mitsui Garden Hotel Ueno

7,"My room was big for Japan, with a comfortable toilet and a big bathtub. The staff were helpful, and they gave me Shiseido skincare amenities for my stay, which was definitely appreciated. Best thing about the hotel is its location: a few minutes walk away from the Keisei station and even nearer the JR Ueno Asakusa gate. It's also very near Ameyoko market and is surrounded by restaurants and malls. Will definitely stay here again.","December 7, 2018","0    Mitsui Garden Hotel Ueno

Spent the day exploring the area and when I returned to check in the staff had placed my luggage in my room already. Check in was quick, staff at the desk spoke English well. Room is great.

9,"The hotel itself is small and less facilities when compared with other Mitsubishi Garden hotels. It’s clean but there are odours from the washroom even though after cleaning up everyday from the housekeeping. I guess it’s a structural issue. The staff are very friendly and efficient. When compared with the hotel rates, I think it’s a bit over-priced but there is room to improve. ","November 8, 2018","0    Mitsui Garden Hotel Ueno

10,"Stay for 3 nights Travel with Family on 3 adults for one room, upgrading from Standard type to Superior type room (double bed) with extra bed, however, found that no space for extra bed to fill in the room!. also, a bed size is quite bigger than normal and can accommodate 3 persons.room size claim 25sq.m. but seems not bigger than Standard type. I can said its so small for 3 persons, admitted that this is a city center hotel in Tokyo.A bed size is good but a bit hard, not comfortable for person that love a soft bed.Staffs are excellence and professional, small lobby need to fast check-in or out, staffs do the job very well. Breakfast is so Japanese style, if you stay more than 3 nights you may consider getting some breakfast outside due to the same menu every day.location is king, you can travel for city and outside Tokyo, great for Airport departure or arrival, you can walk 10 mins from Keisei Skyline to and from Narita AirportPro: location, can go by Metro, JR, Keisei Sky liner to any location easily.Staffs is very good training and prof.Con: - Breakfast is may not worth to spend if you don't like local Japanese tofu.- Small space for the breakfast room, sometimes you need to wait for a queue- Room size is smaller than expected- Shampoo and Body soap is not that good Its not a high grade, compare with Mitsui Garden Kyoto.","October 26, 2018","0    Mitsui Garden Hotel Ueno

13,"We have enjoyed our stay here. After arriving via Keisei skyline rat Ueno Keisei skyliner station, it’s easy to find as once you step outside it is one of the tallest buildings in Ueno with its name clearly written at the top of the building. Head towards jr Ueno statin, or any signs that say Atre stores towards the big walkway overpass and you are heading in the right direction. If raining you can also make you way underground from Ueno to exit 1 that comes out directly next to the hotel entrance. Location is excellent and central to all of yen unless included in your package. It has Japanese, continental and some pasta options. We enjoyed the variety especially the tofu options, 5 different types! Many eating optiions a few minutes walk from hotel.","September 20, 2018","0    Mitsui Garden Hotel Ueno

15,"Spent four days at the Mitsui Ueno a double room with Sakura Panda decorations(which was fun). Room as expected was small, but was spotless; shower was strong with plenty of hot water. Location of hotel is fantastic-just across from Ueno Park, which has so many things to see you could spend a week there alone. Take Keisei Skyliner in from Narita and you're just a couple of minutes walking from the station to the hotel. Many, many, many restaurants in local area, as well as shopping opportunities, and subway is right there for getting around Tokyo. Staff was wonderul; overall great stay and highly recommend.","September 10, 2018","0    Mitsui Garden Hotel Ueno

16,"Slightly over my budget but worth every penny and more! Female travelling alone I wanted to be in a safe and convenient location, the hotel is pretty much part of the Ueno Station! Hotel room (I chose female friendly floor) was small but larger than I anticipated and filled with an entire shop full of products and toiletries! Housekeeping were both thorough and considerate (they don't disturb you!). Staying for six nights I felt at home, you can come and go with a sense of independence but with the added security of front desk 24/7 if needed. Great WiFi, Air Conditioning and another air purifying system, not sure what it was!Only downfall, arriving at midnight I didn't receive any precise walking directions from Ueno Station, which exit etc - the station is quite large with many exits and tunnels. It was quite stressful (even with Google Maps) dragging my luggage across busy roads having just arrived in Tokyo and trying to find the hotel alone and late at night following a 20 hour journey. If supplied, it would have made my stay even better.","August 15, 2018","0    Mitsui Garden Hotel Ueno

17,This is a wonder Hotel. Excellent staff. Very very friendly and professional. The location is walking distance from the train station. We were able to roll our luggages from the subway to the hotel without any problem. Location is great. It is walking distance to many stores and restaurants. Did I mention it’s takes 5-6 minutes to walk to the subway station. Japanese subway system is top notch. It takes you everywhere; very convenient. Back to the hotel. The room is good size and extremely clean. All toiletries included; you don't need to bring anything. It even has a hepa air filtration machine in the room. Bed is nice and firm. AC is quiet and functioning flawlessly. Free wifi that is strong and consistent. The cleaning crew are excellent. The room is all tidied up when we returned in the afternoon. I give this Hotel a big thumbs up. I will definitely stay here again if I return to visit.,"August 10, 2018","0    Mitsui Garden Hotel Ueno

19,"This was a really convenient hotel to check out at the beginning of a trip: it is right near the Ueno train station, which is one of the only hubs the Narita Airport Skyliner hits. So, if you're jetlagged and don't want to think too much about getting from Narita to Tokyo, this is a great way to go.Our stay itself was fantastic. The rooms are small, but it's Tokyo, so that's completely expected. It had fantastic amenities: there was a trouser press, a fabric deodorizer bottle, 2 robes, tea, cups, hot water kettle, bottle opener, and a spa setup with a set of women's loungewear, a hair drier, a straightener, and a face steamer (?). And that's not even getting to the bathroom! The soaps in the bath were lovely, and there was a giant basket of everything you might need/want in a hotel. I held off on using the bath salts (!) because if you had the willpower not to touch any of the single-use items, the hotel would make a donation to an environmental charity. My only minor quibble was they had traditional-style buckwheat pillows, which I personally don't find comfy. But when in Japan...At check-in, our reservation was flagged because we had a package delivered there (our SIM cards) - we didn't even need to ask for it. When the lady at the desk couldn't find it immediately, she apologized profusely, and brought it up about 1 minute later - it had been put in the safe, rather than the drawer with the normal letters. On a similar note, one of the elevators was down, and the staff was incredibly apologetic when we checked out... despite the fact we still never actually had to wait for a ride.Overall, they had great service and really comfortable rooms. I'd definitely stay here again!","June 27, 2018","0    Mitsui Garden Hotel Ueno

20,"I stayed here for a week. This was my first trip to Japan and I used Tokyo as my base for day trips. The hotel is located right across from the Ueno station. Plenty of restaurants in the area. Room was small, which I understand to be normal for Tokyo. They provided pajamas, which was a nice touch. Room was immaculate and bed and pillows were incredibly comfortable. Bathroom was well-stocked with toiletries. Staff was polite and helpful. I didn’t eat at the hotel, so can’t comment on the food. There is a coffee shop adjacent to the hotel entrance which has breakfast set menus for $6-7. There is also a Starbucks in Ueno station.Suggestions for improvement: there was only one English language channel - CNN. Would be nice if they can add 1-2 more. While the bathroom was clean, an unpleasant smell emanated through the pipes.This is a great value and I would stay here again!","June 3, 2018","0    Mitsui Garden Hotel Ueno

21,"The hotel is right next to Exit 1 of the Ueno subway, JR Ueno station, and Keisei Ueno station. You can easily get to all the Tokyo sites from here by using the subway, JR line, or walking. We had a Superior Twin Non-smoking room, not large, but we did not feel cramped. Nice bathroom, comfortable beds, hard pillows, quiet, complimentary water every day (hidden in cupboard next to frig), pajamas, and other nice toiletries. Ameyoko market, Ueno park, many restaurants, and convenience stores are nearby. Staff are friendly, but we did not have occasion to ask them for help because Tokyo is easy to get around if you have a subway map and the Lonely Planet Tokyo guide. We definitely would stay here again if back in Tokyo.One big plus for us was how easy it is to get to the hotel from Narita Airport. Take the Keisei Skyliner from Narita to Ueno. You can buy vouchers for your tickets online before you leave home. You will have a reserved seat and there is space for your luggage. It was pouring rain when we arrived in Tokyo so we took the underground subway tunnels to get from Keisei Ueno to the hotel. Head in the direction of the Ginza subway (don't take the Ginza, this is just to get you started in the right direction). You are looking for Exit 1 which is around a half mile walk. When you leave exit 1, turn right and the hotel is just steps away. (Bikes ride on the sidewalk so look before you step out) (To avoid most of the stairs on Exit 1, use Exit 3 which has elevators. When you exit the elevator to the sidewalk, make a U turn to the left (staying on the same sidewalk) and the hotel is close by). We found exiting the JR Ueno station confusing the first time we used the JR Yamanote line. So a tip - to get to the hotel, use the Central Gate exit and then look for Exit 1. At this hotel and several others in Japan, our Alaska visa card did not ""work"" (basically was not accepted). Be sure to bring more than one type of credit card with you to Japan.","June 2, 2018","0    Mitsui Garden Hotel Ueno

29,"This was our fourth stay at Mitsui Garden Ueno. We normally stay here after a few weeks at the snow and in Tokyo for a few days on the way home. We choose Mitsui Ueno for an number of reasons - great location for transport, well priced and a very clean and comfortable hotel. Ueno is on the Shinkansen line direct from Nagano and Iiyama so this works well with our ski trips. The train station entrances also surround the hotel and you can jump onto one of the many train lines including Metro and JR Li es from there to access any part of the city. A few blocks away are extensive markets that sell anything from clothing, sporting goods, electronics and lots of restaurants. The hotel itself is exceptionally clean. Yes, the rooms are small, but that is Japan. It is perfunctory and has everything you need. We send our ski gear directly to the airport (with Black Cat) so usually only have small back packs. We have struggled in the past when we have had ski gear to stow in the room. Staff are very polite and many of them understand English. This stay we arrived at 1.30pm and even though check in starts at 3pm, because our room was ready we were able to get access. Prices are good (about $210 per night) for this quality hotel.

32,"Mitsui Garden Hotels are usually a good bet when it comes to lodging. Although this was our first time at the Ueno location, we weren't disappointed. Centrally located right across the street from Ueno JR station, this was extremely convenient for walking. We checked in on a busy night and the staff accommodated us with smiling faces. They were also nice enough to make a last minute restaurant reservation for us. The room was small but not uncomfortably small. After all, this is the standard for Japanese rooms. We had two large luggages that we had to move some furniture around to make them fit. This hotel is clean and does what it's supposed to do, keeps your luggages, gives you a place to clean up, and sleep.","December 18, 2017","0    Mitsui Garden Hotel Ueno

One of the exits (exit 1) is just a few doors away from the hotel entrance in the same building. Check-in and check-out was very busy but guests were well attended to. Plenty of restaurants in and around the vicinity. Ueno park is nearby (just next to the Keisei station). Rooms are reasonably sized for Japan with adequate amenities. Umbrellas were available for a raining day, which we appreciate very much.","December 3, 2017","0    Mitsui Garden Hotel Ueno

44,"Enjoying our stay here. We arrived at 10pm, greeted by two nice gentleman who understood far more English than expected by two visitors with no Japanese language despite our Japanese surname! We are fulfilling a ""bucket list"" item. The amenities far exceed our expectations. Everything from toothbrushes, toothpaste, razor, full sized shampoo, conditioner, body wash, even a facial steamer & night clothes as advertised. The bathtub is deep, the water pressure very good and a full featured toilet. There is space in our room for a suitcase. Free bottled water, a hot pot, small fridge, and fresh towels and bed linens daily to boot! Booked thru Hawaiian Airlines vacation packages, our only negative is that we could not book twin beds thru Hawaiian Air's website so our queen sized bed sets flush against the wall requiring one to crawl out of bed! The pedestrian walkway to Ueno Stations - both JR & Keisei Skyliner is very convenient. The Shitamachi bus stops right there also. Once outside the station, we simply turned left and climbed the stairs to the pedestrian bridge where we saw the hitel's rooftop sign. A coffee shop (Precious Coffee)next door and a family mart & 7-eleven convenience stores are just around the corner. All the museums, the park, and shopping anyone could hope for are also convenient.

49,"For our last night in Tokyo, we chose this hotel to be close to Ueno Station and the Keisei Express station that takes passengers direct to Narita Airport in 41 minutes! Fare cost 2500Y. Even though we were facing the main road and the Ueno station, the room was quiet with the double windows to afford us a good night's sleep.Exit the hotel, you’ll find stairs to the overhead walkway to Ueno Station or a short distance to the left, there’s an elevator. Off the hotel lobby is a very nice Italian restaurant, Bosco il Chiantiwith a great menu and reasonable prices. And next to that in the elevator foyer, is a computer and printer. The newspaper rack to the right contains Japanese newspapers and also Japan Times in English. Overall, the hotel is kept very neat and clean. Our room was on the 7th floor with a view of Ueno Station. Although facing the main road, the room was very quiet due to the double windows. We had no problems sleeping through the night. Amenities were the usual safe (in the night table drawer), fridge, humidifier, electric pants press and TV with CNN in English. One minor deficiency was the grungy looking bathroom floor tiles. The coarse sandpaper finish is difficult to clean unless a scrub brush is used. Very apparent as you walk in. Although this room was 16 sq.m., the queen bed was pushed against the wall, making it difficult for one person to get out of bed, unlike the Mitsui Garden Hotel in Kashiwanoha.

Bathroom is spacious and provides all the necessities required.Being a Disney good neighbor hotel, they provide free shuttle to Disneyland. Be sure to make reservation for this shuttle service to & fro once you have set your date to Disneyland as it could be fully-reserved with no available seats. They provide free shuttle to nearest train stations too. Anyway, we took our morning walk to Toyocho station everyday as it is less than 10mins walk away. We also took the paid shuttle to Odaiba which takes less than 20mins compared to taking train which would take longer. The hotel area has some restaurants and Lawson is just nearby. So this hotel is quite convenient. The only problem for us is that they do not have a laundromat within the hotel building. As ours is a long vacation trip, I already planned to do laundry and you can image how big is my jaw-drop when the hotel told me that they do not have a laundry in the hotel. Anyway, they took out a map and pointed us the way to the nearest laundromat. So my husband walked to the laundromat to do the laundry, carrying a big bag of clothes looking like santa-claus (we were there near Christmas by the way... hohoho...)Overall, I'm still quite happy with my stay here.

The decor though looked a bit tired in the lifts, corridors and the room I was in. The bedroom was clean but just needs some time spent doing it up. The bed was comfy and the bathroom linen was always clean and fresh. The TV is limited to a few channels. One of the main plus points would seemed to be the link buses to take you to Disney. There is a voucher system for breakfast with both western and local foods available with a great variety of food on offer.

As the hotel was for business it was ok but I don’t think I would stay there if I was travelling independently on holiday. ","August 27, 2018","1    Hotel East 21 Tokyo

70,Nice hotel with rooms that are a bit worn. Lobby area is nice. A medium sized area in the lobby has chairs and tables with cafe style table service and is open from 10am to 630pm. Buffet breakfast was good with many food and drink options. Plenty of Japanes fare. It takes about 35 to 45 minutes to get downtown on the metro (including walking to Toyoxho station). Was 95 deg F (32 deg C) while I was there. My room was comfortable for me but the air conditioner was probably maxed out. I'd definitely stay again. ,"July 23, 2018","1    Hotel East 21 Tokyo

71,What a joke of a hotel ! Run down building that needs updating .. A portable AC unit in the rooms with dirty floors . I was welcomed into my room with a big poo in the toilet !! They charge 45 per day to swim !!! Not advertised before you book this hotel !!! No tattoos aloud on premises !?!? Funny thing is even after seeing this review the Managment won't do anything still ... Do yourself a favor and find another place that doesn't have fecis in the toilet when you arrive This hotel doesn't even deserve 1 star !!!,"July 15, 2018","1    Hotel East 21 Tokyo

72,"Pros - location: nearby and at the hotel itself is a plaza including many restaurant and a supermarket that opens until 11pm.Walking to Toyocho station is not that far with 7 mins walk. In addition, u can walk to the park in 5 mins. - staffs are great in generalCons- room size is too small for 3 people room- air conditioning is poor and feeling humid and hot in the guest room- though the hotel is like a 4-Star ( convention / conference hotel ) the large space is not relevant to my stay- entire building and facilities are built back in early 90s which needs major renovation- swimming pool requires 4000 yen ! But the website did not mention- gym is small and old if you care","July 13, 2018","1    Hotel East 21 Tokyo

Two single beds for my parents, one sofa-bed for me and my son. A nice, big room for us all with plenty of space for the children to play and explore. A great view across Tokyo from the window.Hotel was easy to find. A five minute walk from the Metro station. Supermarket, shops and restaurants by the base of the hotel too.Sleep quality was great. Nice comfy beds. A little bit of noise from the corridor, but nothing too bad.Breakfast was superb. Plenty of choice and tasty food. Good for young children too, with rice, cereal, yoghurt, fresh fruit and plenty of other choices.All in all, a really great stay.

86,"Room was a good size, clean, and comfortable. Hotel Staff were all very friendly and attentive and the Breakfast Buffet was delicious with many options. While the hotel is a ways away from the city center (depending on what you consider the city center, that is), it was incredibly easy for us to walk to the subway and reach all of the tourist destinations quickly. I would just suggest steering clear of morning rush hour if you can - it can be difficult to board the subway headed into the city at that time. But as long as you're bold and don't mind cramming yourself in, you'll be fine.","November 11, 2017","1    Hotel East 21 Tokyo

87,"I’ve stayed here on business trips many times over the last 15 years. I stay here because my company is walking distance. The staff is friendly and attentive. In-house dining is good. American selections for the breakfast buffet is basic but good quality. Asian selections are numerous. The rooms are typical of Japan, small but very clean and well maintained. A bit basic but perhaps because I just get the single corporate rate room. It’s still nice tho. My only complaint is that for me, the bed is extremely firm. A bit too firm for my taste. Access to subway station is only a couple blocks, 5-10 min walk at most. From there, anywhere is easily accessible a fairly short ride away. Subways are very easy to navigate and cheap. There are many resturants nearby, of all different types, several in the same complex. There is a large grocery store next door and an ATM for easy cash access. The hotel itself is probably rated a four star but the atmosphere is very comfortable. I see a lot of business people staying here but then I also see a lot of families and student groups as well. You feel just as at home wearing sweats or a suit and tie. It’s also a short distance to the Tokyo Skytree, a great sightseeing attraction and restraunt/shopping mall. It’s also a great view from one whole side of the hotel. I enjoy looking over the city from my room at night, just beautiful. There are several resturants in-house and a top of the hotel bar with a piano and singer. A bit pricy but not unexpected. I’m not sure if I would call it mid range or luxury. Check out thier website for rates. I don’t think it’s overpriced but it’s not cheap either, but then it’s Tokyo. What’s cheap here? Service, location and values all rate a 4 with me. This form won’t let me use the ratings below. Overall a good place to stay, I recommend it.","November 6, 2017","1    Hotel East 21 Tokyo

88,"I stayed with my family for 9 nights and the hotel was a disappointment. Some good things are the fact that it is surrounded by a supermarket, coffee shops and restaurants of all kinds (however, it takes between 7-10 min to walk to get to Toyocho train station, the closest to hotel). Also, it is good that the Airport Limousine Bus from/to Narita and Haneda Airport stops here. The concierge service is good and they were efficient in booking our Airport Limousine Bus tickets and giving us the right information about things related to Tokyo. Room service was also good, they responded immediately.Unfortunately, the good things end here. There are a lot of things that are not matching average international standards. If the service continues this way, I don't see how the hotel can attract international visitors for the Rugby World Cup 2019 and the Tokyo Olympics 2020. These are the things were the hotel did not do well during our stay:1) Since we traveled with a 1-year old kid, the hotel installed a child guard in one of the beds. The problem was that one day after staff cleaned the room, the child guard was installed in the wrong way, there was a big hole and our son could have fallen through it.2) After check-in, we noticed our room had not been cleaned properly, we found a sock from a previous guest behind a sofa.3) This is the only hotel in the world that I know where guests have to pay to use the gym4) After we checked-out, the front desk forgot to give us a parcel that a friend had sent to us. They only noticed after we had arrived to the airport and they had to send it to us by airmail.(They acknowledged they forgot to give it to us)5) Staff in the lobby lounge were not considerate. One morning, my son asked me to take him to the fountain in the lounge lobby. The lounge was almost empty, one two tables taken. I sat with my son in a sofa next to the fountain and I am asked what I wanted to order. When I told them I was just staying here for my son to watch the fountain, they asked us to leave the lobby lounge, no matter I explained we were staying in this hotel. 6) Some staff in the front desk cannot understand English well.7) Trash bins in the hotel rooms are too small.8) Only one English channel on TV (CNN)My advice is to only stay here if you did not find accommodation in another hotel in Tokyo and/or you have to do something around Koto, Toyocho area","October 14, 2017","1    Hotel East 21 Tokyo

We booked the family room which had 4 beds so although the adults were also in single beds, it was very comfortable and quite spacious, especially considering Tokyo size rooms. We had a little table were we ate the nights that we were too exhausted to go out and a fridge. A walking closet and plenty of tables/night stands. Large windows that although you cannot open, had incredible views. Lots of sunshine. Large bathroom with the typical extras on toilet features so the little one kept pushing the warming toilet seat button :)Breakfast was included and excellent considering we were in Asia. Both, Asian and Western options available. Very good espressos and lattes. Service at the restaurant was quick to replace items and the kids ate eggs in every imaginable form of cooking so they were happy. Fresh fruit and all sort of pancakes, waffles, etc.The hotel had a bit of 80/90's look but all was very well maintained. Few options around in case you are tired at night to have dinner or shop to take to your room. Once night we just grabbed chicken sandwiches from BK and were happy with those. After all the walking with the kids, by night, we had very little energy to do much more. They offered a trip to the Tokyo Tower. I didn't go buy my husband/kids enjoyed the views but also mentioned that they kept asking for more and more money to get higher in the tower so find out exactly what is offered before going. They also took a long time to get back. Tube is around 400 mtrs (4 blocks) away. Not too far but something to take into consideration.","June 16, 2017","1    Hotel East 21 Tokyo

Fancy Japanese style room (was called the ""concept room"") we were on the 20th floor and the view was incredible. The staff spoke very good English and helped us with many questions and enquirers. The train/subway station was a very easy and quick 9 minute walk straight down the road. The bus was also a very quick 20 minute drive to Disney sea and very easy to organize. You do have to reserve a seat but it's very easy to do at the hotel or online. (Simply change the language to English if need be) there are plenty of food options around the hotel with convenience stores, super markets, bakery, subway, cafe, Italian etc within walking distance. We also ended up staying an extra night but due to it being booked out we had to switch rooms to a regular double-bed room for our third night. It was a lot smaller but it did the job. If your willing to fork out the extra $$$ go for the concept room it's gorgeous and big! Definitely recommend we had a very pleasant stay! (Unfortunately, we regretfully didn't take any photos, it didn't do the view justice anyway) ","March 23, 2017","1    Hotel East 21 Tokyo

112,"I booked this hotel because it was high atop Trip Advisor's list of Best Value hotels in Tokyo. Either that ranking is unwarranted or Tokyo hotels in general provide little value. (This was my first visit.) After my outstanding experience at Cross Hotel Kyoto, this one felt a bit shabby. The hallway was hot, as was the room when I got there. The thermostat instructions were in Japanese, so it took awhile to get the temperature to normal (Googling the serial number bailed me out). The bathroom was a couple inches off the main floor, making it easy to stub one's toe. The water pressure in the sink was inadequate. The shower head was portable, but the fixture for it was inflexible, so getting a comfortable angle was not possible. That said, it was easy enough to get a good night's sleep, and the location was good (walkable to the heart of Shinjuku and to trains, but in a quiet area). Your options might be better in other neighborhoods -- I would try Harajuku or Koenji on my next visit.","June 25, 2019","2    Hotel Sunroute Higashi Shinjuku

113,"As with all Japanese hotels, this hotel is very small. However, it is very clean and quiet.I contacted the hotel prior and they shared 3 ways of getting there:1. The most convenient wayTaking ''Airport limousine bus'' (120min. 3,100Yen) to Busta Shinjuku, then take taxi from there to our hotel (10min. approx. 800 Yen) or walk to Shinjuku Nishiguchi station of Oedo line (subway) and take Oedo line to Higashi Shinjuku Station (1 stop). We are very close to B2 exit.2. Faster wayTaking ''JR Narita Express'' (train) to Shinjuku station (90 min. 3,190Yen), then take taxi from there to our hotel (10min. approx. 800 Yen) or walk to　Shinjuku Nishiguchi station of Oedo line (subway) and take Oedo line to Higashi Shinjuku Station.3. The fastest and cheapest wayTaking Keisei Skyliner (train) to Ueno station (40 min. 2,500Yen), then walk underground street (10 minutes) to Ueno Okachimachi station of Oedo line (subway) and take Oedo line to Higashi Shinjuku Station (15 min. about 230 Yen).I went with Option 3 and it was pretty convenient. Go to Exit B2, turn left. The hotel is just a 2 minute walk from Exit B2.There is also a lift to the ground level, incase you need to lug your luggage.","June 17, 2019","2    Hotel Sunroute Higashi Shinjuku

114,"My husband and I recently spent two weeks in Japan, and the first three days were here in Tokyo.The room was tiny by American standards but that’s just the way it is everywhere in Japan unless you’re willing to shell out some Big Yen. Besides, why would we want to stay in our room for anything other than sleeping and washing up? So, the room was fine. It was clean, and the bed was comfortable. Check-in and check-out was easy, and the staff spoke some English.The location is great. It’s in Shinjuku (the entertainment district) but on the outer edges where it’s a bit quieter. There are plenty of bars, restaurants, and shopping within an easy walking distance.We paid a little extra and got the breakfast buffet included during our stay. You go through the lobby to get to the restaurant next door – The Royal Host. It’s a chain restaurant comparable to a Denny’s I guess. You exchange your breakfast ticket (that you get at the hotel when you check-in) for a card to leave on the table that tells others it’s occupied. You flip the card over to show that you’re done and then leave.The buffet itself has a wide variety of options. There are the standard western breakfast staples like scrambled eggs, bacon, and fruit as well as traditional Japanese items like rice, miso soup, netto (fermented soy beans), pickled veggies, and a variety of fish. It’s nothing fancy but it will fill you up.The only issue we had with the hotel was actually finding it. We landed in Narita after a 13 hour flight, took JR’s Narita Express into the city and got off in Shinjuku Station. The station is absolutely enormous, crowded and overwhelming … especially if you haven’t slept in 24 hours. We stumbled around a while trying to find the train to the Higashi Station until we discovered that you have to switch from the JR line to the city’s Metro system. Once we understood that everything was fine.So, overall, this is a fine base of operations while you enjoy this fabulous city!","June 9, 2019","2    Hotel Sunroute Higashi Shinjuku

Upon arrival my friend and I had to pay extra for twin beds instead of a single bed even though our reservation specified (and we showed our confirmation) twin beds. We were then informed that to make local phone calls we would have to pay a fee if we used the hotel phone. We would also be charged for using the TV (mind we weren’t looking to rent anything, just watch local channels). When asked if the hotel could call us a taxi my friend was told they would charge us and when I later asked they flat out told me no because it was too early (it was 8am).

This is the exit right next to hotel, until you get your bearings.Check in was fast (it was 11at night) very welcoming and efficient speaking very good English. Check out so much faster.The rooms are so small, however I’m guessing this is the normal. My husband and l felt like we stood on top of each other however only in the room to sleep. T.v. Only has BBC as the English Channel but have option to pay for movies.The room was clean and bathroom had shower over a tub and was very clean. Toothbrush and brush and razor available.The towels are dated and very flimsy but somehow still dried you fast.No noise from other rooms however the road/outside noise is really loud and if your a light sleeper like me then you will wake easy.","April 22, 2019","2    Hotel Sunroute Higashi Shinjuku

136,"We stayed at this hotel due to the location and the price. I thought I was prepared for the size of the rooms in Japan but I was not. The room we had was tiny, the bed was up against the wall, there was not enough room for both our suitcases, so they had to be closed against the wall in order to move around the room. There is not enough space for both people to move around the room, so be prepared.  The hotel itself is fine, it is an average 3 star hotel. We certainly did not pick it because it was luxurious. However, it was very clean, the cleaning staff were very friendly and we had no issues with noise at all during our stay. The staff on the front desk were not very friendly and would ignore you as you arrive back to the hotel in the evening. The location is excellent you are talking about a 10-15 minute walk into the centre of Shinjuku. There is so much to see along the way that you wont even notice the walk. I cannot fault the location at all. The hotel is located on what seemed to be a main roadway and its basically a straight walk into the centre. Its probably more of a 20-25 minute walk to Shinjuku station. I would advise getting a taxi from the station to the hotel with your luggage as its too far to walk with luggage. If you are staying here, you would be staying here out of pure convenience of the location and for the price of the room, nothing more.","January 3, 2019","2    Hotel Sunroute Higashi Shinjuku

We stayed her twice in 2016 because we arrived in Tokyo just to stay overnight before taking the Shinkansen to Hiroshima early the next morning, and returned for the last 3 days before leaving for home from NRT. We love the hotel because it’s 1) super clean and modern (newly renovated again), 2) quiet rooms (hotel faces lower traffic street, windows sound-insulated, high floor, and quiet fellow travelers in hallways), 3) located within 50m of entrance-B of Higashi-Shinjuku station where 2 subway lines can be accessed and 2 stops from the big Shinjuku Sta., 4) lots of convenience stores nearby, 5) nice English-speaking staff, 6) relatively inexpensive, and 7) walkable to parks, shopping, night life, and restaurants.

We booked the economy double to try and keep the price reasonable as Tokyo hotel prices are expensive, but we had not realised how small the room would be and there was only just enough floor space around two sides of the bed to put our suitcases down, so we had to constantly step over them to get into bed.

144,"I spent a week at the Sunroute Higashi in October of this year. Checking in the staff was friendly and helpful and speak reasonable English. Our room was 14 sq.m which is about standard in Shinjuku. The decor of the room made me feel at home so I had no problem sleeping well at night or taking a good afternoon nap.What I really liked about this hotel is that they give a good discount for long stay which I believe is four days or more, and their breakfast buffet. I stuffed myself each morning with potatoes. bacon and perfect scrambled eggs. My Asian wife had a wide selection of Japanese food to choose from. Now the reason why I mention the breakfast buffet is that food in Tokyo is very expensive and you can easily save 2000 yen by eating at the buffet before going out sightseeing. Speaking of sightseeing, this hotel is located just a few yards from a minor metro station which is easy to navigate but which can take you anywhere in Tokyo. It is a short walk to korea town with some very good restaurants and there is a mini mart not far away. In conclusion one can save money and energy staying at this hotel.","October 24, 2018","2    Hotel Sunroute Higashi Shinjuku

The Higashi-Shinjuku hotel is located a short walk north of Shinjuku Station (and about a minute walk to H-S Station). It is close to tons and tons of food/drink outlets and is in an ideal location right next to Golden-Gai - you can drink all night and forget about last trains! The staff service was exceptional and the fact that there are money changing machines in the lobby is a big bonus too.

Plenty of food choices nearby and some are 24-hrs. Economic choice of stay.The greatest disappointment, and certainly a more helpful act would be needed here, was that the hotel refused to assist in restaurant reservation (never mind it was a Michelin-star). Before check-in I was told that my credit card details were needed before they could proceed. Ended up was told that they simply did not provide assistance at all except language support.

The room is a standard room , small room is Japan trademark but it’s next to higashi shinjuku station. When you have a long walking day hahah.. this would be a good choice and the place is more quite but still there was few eateries and 24/7 mart nearby. Compare to shinjuku is less convenient but the train route are more easier.

153,"There was a lot of things we liked about this hotel during our eight-day stay, but the convenience of its location clearly tops the list. It is literally just one door away from the subway entrance. Considering that Tokyo is a subway intensive city, this fact goes a long ways. We also enjoyed staying in Shinjuku. Visiting other Tokyo districts, we felt we took the right decision staying in that neighborhood.But everything else was great as well. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful, always ready to provide some change for your money or lend power adapters or make reservations for a special dinner (in this regard, please honor any reservations you make, because foreigners missing their restaurant reservations has been an issue in Tokyo lately, from what I read).As with any property in this price range in Tokyo, the rooms are small and Sunroute makes this very clear on their website. We had reserved a standard double, but when we got to the room we concluded that because of our luggage we would not be comfortable. We checked with the front desk and fortunately they had a slightly larger room available for an upgrade, which was fine for us.Amenities included a hair dryer, slippers, bathrobes, and good-quality toiletries. The shower was powerful and mattress and bedding were exceptionally comfortable. As with just about everything in Japan, the room was spotlessly clean.On the second floor, there are coin-operated washers and dryers, something very convenient for longer travels. We used and found them very convenient and easy to use.Breakfast is not included in the basic rate, but you can have this meal at the adjoining restaurant (Royal Host) for JPY 1,030, a steal for the generous buffet they offer. Get your voucher at the reception.In a nutshell, I believe one cannot find a better hotel deal in Tokyo in this price range.","July 30, 2018","2    Hotel Sunroute Higashi Shinjuku

The bathroom is a nice size, the room had storage space for suitcases. Honestly couldn't fault the hotel really.Location wise, the B2 exit from the metro is like a minute walk from the hotel. The main transport in Japan is train, so if you have never been before, this hotel is a perfect location for you, as you can get around the city quite easily from this hotel.There is also shops close by and a Mcdonalds, which always is handy !

Loved that it was near all the other subway lines which required interchange of lines. It was also only a stop away from the main Shinjuku Line where the Odaykyu Romance Car was to travel to Hakone and other parts of Tokyo. it is also within walking distance to Shinjuku itself. As it is not too centralized to Shinjuku, it was relatively quiet and I enjoyed my stay after a long day of sightseeing. Family Mart was next door and loads of eateries around.

It’s right next door to Higashi-Shinjuku station (direct line- 4 stops to Shibuya station or even Yokohama) and just a 10 minute walk to the neon-lit centre, where most of the restaurants are, as well as the big department store, ‘Isetan’ - worth visiting the basement level for their food hall and trying lots of different things!The hotel itself is spotless and the staff are very welcoming and helpful. The rooms are bigger than the last hotel I stayed in (APA Hotel) with desk space, mini fridge & kettle, a small rail to hang clothes and a full double bed (for single occupancy). Note, the room size is still not huge which is typical for Tokyo. The bathroom also has a mini bath and all the toiletries you need - I didn’t once use my own in the end.I also had the best sushi of my stay in Tokyo just around the corner at ‘Sushi-Zambia Higashi Shinjuku’ - check it out!Would definitely recommend this hotel.","June 5, 2018","2    Hotel Sunroute Higashi Shinjuku

Sound proofing is amazing.Hopefully we get to go back there again.TIP: If it is your first time in Tokyo, trust me , you do not want to stay close to one of the big stations. Instead, pick a location like Gotanda.","April 30, 2019","3    Mitsui Garden Hotel Gotanda

170,"Stayed for a week with family, and had a good stay.The good:* Excellent location - it is 5 minutes from the Gotanda station. Within short walking distance, there is also plenty of food choices.* Great staff - very friendly - helped us with our luggage multiple times, booked a taxi for us and even helped with the luggage down, I can't say enough good things about the staffs.* Clean rooms, spacious given the price and our location.* Amenities are good - my wife tried the public bath, which she said was good. There are 2 washing machines and vending machines, and there is a Lawson in the building as well.The not so good:* I really can't think of anything major - perhaps it would be nice to have USB charging ports as an addition. They do have a multi-adapter charger in the room, so that's covered.* Hotel","April 21, 2019","3    Mitsui Garden Hotel Gotanda

172,"Very clean and very modern. Quiet. The bathroom amenities were outstanding ....anything you might need is right there, also pjs and slippers every day. The hotel is very near the Gotanda train station so it was easy getting around Tokyo. I understand the rooms are large by Japanese standards but still seemed a tad small. The only downside is there wasn’t a lot of storage space for clothes, and I overpacked slightly for a 10 day stay. Housekeeping was very reliable, and very respectful of door signs (didn’t disturb, cleaned during time requested, never skipped, etc.). The price was very reasonable for the quality of the hotel and services, Highly recommend.","April 12, 2019","3    Mitsui Garden Hotel Gotanda

Its lobby was set on 15th floor with a alfresco windy balcony for the panoramic views of Gotanda. Its has clean simple Japanese onsen provided for guests on 16th floor which needed guest room keycards to electronically open onsen’s door. Its guest rooms was decorated in a minimalist modern style which well mad use of limited space.

175,"First, the hotel is very new. It is just a few minutes walk from Gotanda Station. Most convenient amongst the hotels that I have stayed - one doesn't have to walk down or up lots of stairways inside/outside stations unlike many hotels that I had stayed before, though are also very close to railway stations but they are comparatively larger and more complicated.The shower pressure is one of the best. Most impressive of all, the air conditioning is really maneuverable, unlike many of the hotels in Japan.Another pro is that the supermarket annexed to Gotanda Station operates until midnight.If you wish to rent a car for day trip like I had done, this hotel is perfect as car rental is just about two hundred meters away so you don't have to worry finding a carpark for the night, which is always expensive in downtown Tokyo.","April 2, 2019","3    Mitsui Garden Hotel Gotanda

176,"Mitsui Garden GotandaThis is a relatively new hotel near Gotanda Station. Here are some of the salient points about the hotel as follows:The location is very good. It is about 5 minutes walk from JR Yamanote Line platform. If you are coming from Hamamatsucho Station and taking Yamanote Line, you are advised to take the back half of the train. It will be nearer for you to take the escalator up to 4th floor of Tokyu Remy Departmental Store, and then take the escalators in the store all the way down to ground floor. Go straight out of the main entrance across the road to the next junction, then turn right. The surrounding is quiet compared to Shinjuku or Ikebukuro. Not so jam packed with people but it is still relatively easy to look for food. There are lots of eateries around the area. The staff at the front desk are super friendly and helpful. They are well trained, English speaking, efficient, accommodating and helpful. One of its staff help me to book an e-ticket online to TeamLab Borderless. There is a Lawson convenient store on ground floor.There is a quick check out option available. You just need to drop your card keys into the check out box at the lift lobby and walk out. Is that easy?The room is big by Japanese standard with basic facilities.They offer you free use of WiFi plus the spa and public bath facilities on 16th floor.The breakfast spread is simply wonderful. Plenty of choices and of good quality. Simply put, it is a gem in Tokyo. ","March 19, 2019","3    Mitsui Garden Hotel Gotanda

The public bath upstairs was crowded and the water had chemical small, so only used it once during my week long stay. There are many different restaurants and little stores within walking distance from the hotel. The most convenient is the Remy building connected to the Gotanda station, with various shops and a supermarket (Tokyu Store).

182,"We stayed at this hotel after staying for a week at one of the Hilton hotels. We are a family off four so we needed to book 2 rooms. At first we found it hard to find from the station even though it so close. The station has many exits stay on the road level otherwise you will need to carry all of your luggage up over a bridge.The location is the advantage of this hotel. Gotanda itself is nothing to stay for; however, the location is a great base for all of your touring. We purchased a tourers Pasmo pass which meant we didn’t have to worry about what train we went on. Put about $25 for 4 days if you are going to do a lot of sight seeing.Okay... the rooms, yes they are tiny. We had the moderate rooms as these were what was offered on the site we booked on. They were very tight. We struggled with our luggage in the rooms which gave little area to move around in. The bathroom ( was not even 1.5 metres wide). The bath is a sit in one with legs scrunched. The walls are panelled like a caravan. The hotel is clean, house keeping was ok but not consistent and things like the jug and cups and saucers were not cleaned up. My husbands room got complimentary water each day we got it once?This room in this hotel would suit a single traveller/business traveller not 2 people with luggage. So be careful of you book online on a booking site as the Hotels site says they are suited for business people but the site we booked on did not and used a different name for the rooms. A note on the Onsen’s, we did not use it as my family could not get pass the fact that you cannot wear swimwear in them. Staff were friendly and helpful. The Restaurant Tanto Tanto was lovely with a good variety of dishes and very friendly staff. Reasonable pricing.There is a small shopping mall very close with a Starbucks and a few variety stores. A Lawson is next door which was great for drinks etc. the hotel has a small sitting area at reception and they are happy to store your bags in the foyer.We would not stay here again as a family unless we booked two larger rooms.If all you need is a bed at night and you are going to be out for the rest then this could be a central hotel for the city and the airports.","January 3, 2019","3    Mitsui Garden Hotel Gotanda

183,"I had a good experience staying in other Mitsui Garden Hotel so when I found out that this is newly opened in June, I booked it without hesitant.The hotel is conveniently located near the station but as I do not have the right directions to it when I first arrive, took us a while in the rain to find it. If you arrive by train on the JR Yamanote line, walk to the end of the platform before you exit the gantry. There, it is linked to a mall and there’s escalators or lift if you have luggage. The hotel is round the corner of the 2nd crossing after you exit the supermart.We stayed here for 4 nights and it’s a great base for travelling around Tokyo. No complains about the rooms since the hotel is new and WiFi is strong. Breakfast at the hotel has quite a good option but it does get quite crowded. Anyway the supermart near the hotel has such great options of food & pastries for breakfast or supper. There are also many eateries around the hotel that you will not be short of food choices.Definitely be staying here again when I come back to Tokyo.","December 22, 2018","3    Mitsui Garden Hotel Gotanda

The spa located in the highest floor is not bad, but be aware of some tourists who bring their phone into the big bath.(most probably their first time?) I would like to give thanks to Ms Iwase who had been most helpful during our stay, especially when we were catching our bus to Narita airport.

I booked the superior room on the high floor and my room was not that close to adjacent buildings so I could keep the curtains up at night. The room was brand-new and modern. It was small though quite common in Tokyo. The staff was well-trained and up to the standard of Japanese hospitality. I was especially impressed by the onsen on the top floor. The onsen was not big but getting to enjoy it in Tokyo downtown was delightful experience. There is no gym or carpark that is why it doesn’t have a 4-or 5- star. The hotel is conveniently located near Gotanda station. My advice if you have luggage with you is that you exit the JR from the Tokyu Store 東急ストア exit (same level as the gates) and take its elevator to the ground floor so you don’t need to hold the luggage through the stairs.","July 31, 2018","3    Mitsui Garden Hotel Gotanda

205,"We stayed here for 4 nights after arriving in Tokyo and after a week in Fuji/Kyoto/Hiroshima, we can back to stay another 3 nights. We were so comfortable here! the room: more like a small apartment was plenty for our family of 4 (kids 16,14) Small kitchen allowed us to prep/microwave food from nearby stores. Room was clean and it helps that the hotel is newer than the other Mimaru locations nearby. Small dining area allowed us to simulate family meals when we weren't eating out. the room design separated the area for toilet, shower, and bathroom sink so it never felt cramped. location: hotel is located in a very quiet and safe neighborhood but just close enough to metro stations and attractions. It's a great home base to see all of Tokyo. We round-tripped on the Keisei Skyliner from Narita to Keisei-Ueno station. While our 7 day JR pass was still in effect, we used the Yamanote loop from Ueno station to get to the west side of Tokyo (Shinjuku, Harajuku). If no JR pass, very nearby Inaricho station on the Ginza line is a straight shot to Shibuya. 24hr supermarket/convenience stores made it easy to bring food back to the room and eat as a family. staff: Hats off to Kyran, Amber and the rest of the staff for making us absolutely feel at home during our 7 nights. Kyran was like a old friend from the the very first night we checked in. I highly recommend this hotel!","June 14, 2019","4    MIMARU TOKYO UENO INARICHO

206,"We just returned from a great 5 night stay. The hotel pictures of the rooms accurately reflect how large and clean the rooms are. The room can comfortably fit a family of 4 or 5. Each floor of the hotel has only 3 rooms which are very similar, but with slightly different configurations. Our group had 3 families and the hotel was able to assign us rooms on the same floor, so we had the entire floor to ourselves. It was so nice for the kids in our group to be able to go in/out of each other's rooms without bothering other guests. Each of the bathrooms has the toilet, shower/bath, and sink area divided from each other, which makes the bathroom easier to share. As others have mentioned, the hotel has a partial cleaning policy so they empty the trash cans each day, but only change linens/make beds every several days (our 4th night of 5 nights. That worked for us just fine, and they have daily cleaning as an option for an extra fee for those who desire it.It was very helpful to have the laundry facility on the ground floor. There are 3 washers and 3 dryers. There is a change machine that will break a 1000 yen bill. The laundry detergent is 100 yen (and takes 1 100 yen coin). Washers are 300 yen, and dryers are 100 yen for 30 minutes. You'll likely need 2 - 30 minute drying cycles to fully dry your clothes. The hotel even provides a small container to hold dirty laundry. The hotel is very close to both the Ueno and Inaricho stations, and various amenities. Ueno station can take you to almost anywhere in Tokyo very readily. We took the Skyliner from Narita (which was very easy), and we took the JR train (with 1 very easy transfer) to get to Haneda airport. Each trip took just under an hour, door to door. I highly recommend this hotel and look forward to another great stay there.","June 7, 2019","4    MIMARU TOKYO UENO INARICHO

215,"We have just finished a 6 night stay here and I cannot speak highly enough of this property. We stayed in the Japanese Style room and it was perfect, so much space for the family and it came with a Kitchen and everything we needed. Travelling with 2 small children, this is a rare find indeed in Tokyo, and what made our trip even more special was the staff. They were endlessly helpful, nothing was ever a problem. 2 mins from the Hotel was a 24hr local supermarket that stocked everything, so we had breakfast self catered in our room and often take away dinners from some of the local restaurants the other nights. Having the freedom of the kitchen was priceless. As location goes, located in a quiet street, 3mins walk from Inaricho Subway Station, 10mins walk from the Keisei Skyliner direct to Narita at Ueno. Ueno Park and Zoo are ajacent to the station. Food Street is opposite Ueno Station so its all here. Tokyo is not easy to find family hotel solutions but the Mimaru is a step ahead and I cannot speak highly enough of them. The property was spotless, even had a laundry! We will definately be back.

253,"this is basic Dormy Inn--clean, small rooms, nothing fancy, decent location half way between Shibuyu and Harajuku stations, close to Cat and Otamosendo Street. More like a college dorm than a fancy hotel, but if you're just looking for a good night sleep and no concierge, this will do fine. Plus, on the floor with the spa there is a free choice of pillow types. First I've seen of this great idea. No longer can anyone complain the pillow was too this or that, although a word from the otherwise efficient staff about this feature might be useful. I gave three stars not that there was anything wrong with the hotel; it excels at its niche. It's just like a five star with concierge, English fluency, swimming pool, real onset with natural mineral water, etc. Half the rooms face the train tracks, which I suspect can be noisy although I was on the other side so I'm not sure. Only negative is that spa area smelled like mold or dirty socks or something mildly unpleasant. Might have been transitory; might have been why they put a dozen or more whole oranges in the hot bath.","June 20, 2019","5    Dormy inn Premium Shibuya Jingumae

The space was not as tight as other twin rooms in Japan and we appreciated the phone charger adapter provided. Definitely nice and clean with storage niches, slippers, and bath robes for the spa. But there was only one towel rail :-(Our biggest problem was the sensor light in the lobby area designed to light your way to the bathroom at night. It shows through a slit in the door and comes on and off all night with the slightest movement. Take some blue tac and a couple of sheets of paper to block it out! The sound insulation from the adjacent rail way was very effective. ","May 15, 2019","5    Dormy inn Premium Shibuya Jingumae

I will recommend not to order their breakfast as menu never change and you will eat the same thing every day (Apart from one pasta dishes that will be changed every day).There are a lot of vending machines which is good. You can also rent an extra pillow, which I'm not quite sure how it works and it looks dirty as anyone can grab the pillow and return it in the communal area.

262,"Overall had a good experience. I went with my wife and 9 year old and initially had the double room, which supposedly slept 2 adults and a child under 11. First the caveat - we're not big people (I'm 5'8) and have stayed in plenty of small hotel rooms through the world but this was the smallest by far. It was about 15 sq m and had literally zero room to move around (the bed occupies 3/4 of the room space). We were able to upgrade to a ""triple"" (3 single beds) on the 6th floor and that was much more spacious at 32 sq m, you could actually walk around and the bathroom shower was more standard western sized. It was about 6000Y more per night but definitely worth it because the hotel itself is relatively inexpensive.That initial room size shock aside, the hotel was great. Very clean, the front desk and overall service was excellent, the staff goes out of their way to help and they spoke English (if that's important to you). The location is actually pretty sweet, right between Shibuya and Harajuku, for shopping and eating excursions. It's about a 10-12 minute walk to either the Shibuya or Harajuku station lines. I suggest departing from Shibuya as the walk to Harajuku is more uphill (but come back from Harajuku). The hotel does have a shuttle to Shibuya station on mornings only every half-hour, but you have to reserve a spot.The wifi on both the 4th and 6th floors was great; contrary to a few other reviews, we really didn't hear the train at all, though we ran the A/C unit on auto mode non-stop. Each room has a mini-fridge and the hotel gives you 2-3 free water bottles daily. They have free soba ramen noodles every night from 9:30-11pm and an onsen spa on the 2nd floor (we didn't have time to partake but open men, women, children - read up on etiquitte!).Overall, I think the value was incredibly good. We've typically stayed at the Cerulean Tower or Westin Tokyo; I realize those are higher class but much more pricey. Honestly, if I were just sightseeing and spending a lot time walking Shibuya/Harajuki most of the day (i.e. not just hanging in hotel), I'd go for this hotel - save some $$ and spend it on great food or fashionable clothing!","October 12, 2018","5    Dormy inn Premium Shibuya Jingumae

There is also a logistics company which is based pretty much opposite the entrance of the hotel. They start operating at 6:00am and it gets very noisy by the trucks coming & going as well as the goods being put on and off them. Having said the above, I highly recommend this hotel but.... insist on a quiet room & if there are 2 of you, stay in the twin room and push the beds together. The rooms are tiny but comfortable. The location is superb & the train station is literally around the corner. The little extra things the hotel offers goes a long way ie.

Is this way, most of the walk will be underground.","February 13, 2018","5    Dormy inn Premium Shibuya Jingumae

278,"My 2nd stay at the Dormy Inn, this time for 7 nights for business trip, again I was very happy with all aspects of the hotel! Breakfast is great with plenty of choice, complimentary shuttle to Shibuya station is a very good service. Onsen is outstanding and the staff are extremely courteous and efficient! Very comfortable bed, and very quiet room, I could see the railway line from my room, but was never disturbed by any noise.Will definitely stay here during my next visit to Tokyo!","December 27, 2017","5    Dormy inn Premium Shibuya Jingumae

279,"Poor customer service, boring breakfast with the same menu everyday. We are a family of 3 with 1 infant with us and reach hotel at 9am and was hoping to get a room earlier which we did indicate in our booking request as well. The staff had first informed that no room is available and we have to wait until 1pm earliest to get the room. therefore as it was raining heavily outside, we have stayed at the lobby to wait. Throughout, we were not even offered a drink. At 1215, the staff approach us and say the room is now available! We were so grateful but when we proceed to the counter for check-in, they made us pay for the early check-in. What a service is this? I was thinking should I wait till 1pm to get the room without a top up! My girl is so tired and I have no choice to pay unwillingly for the early check-in. Dormy Inn! Please Do NOT do this to your customers especially with infants, they will NV return!","November 5, 2017","5    Dormy inn Premium Shibuya Jingumae

281,"We stayed for a couple of nights. We arrived by train and lugged our cases for quite a few blocks to get there - it isn't the easiest place to find!The staff are very helpful, particularly at the desk - nothing is too much trouble for them.The room is typically small, a little more so than others in Tokyo but the facilities are good. Effective a/c, cable tv, wifi all good.Being some distance from the subway was a pain - but local shopping and dining was excellent!The best coffee in Tokyo was just around the corner (Abahouse) - after extensive research.The hotel is in the backstreet with a variety of delivery companies etc in front of it so there are always vans, drivers etc bustling around.They do offer a shuttle bus service to the railway but only in the morning. Apparently nobody who stays at this hotel flies after 12 noon. Our flight was in the evening so we lugged our suitcases past the idle shuttle bus to the not so near station. I found this pretty bizarre if I'm honest - hardly a customer focused system - just convenient for the hotel.So it's a mixed bag I'm afraid - lovely people in a nice hotel in a secondary location and selective transport arrangements.","September 26, 2017","5    Dormy inn Premium Shibuya Jingumae

282,"I stayed here 2 years ago on my first ever solo trip. It quickly became my favorite place to stay and I often compare other hotels I stay at to this one. I'm always very relaxed and happy here, and I think they've actually gotten better since my last stay.The rooms are small, but actually, after traveling all over Japan, I find these are the biggest rooms I've stayed in on my trip.I loved the breakfast last time I was here, and they've added a lot to the food selection since. There was fresh fruit every morning (which surprised me because fruit is so expensive in Japan), Western and Japanese style breakfast, cereal/milk/yogurt bar, and drink bar. They have a machine with different types of tea, a peach smoothie and tomato smoothie machine, and coffee. The mini waffles and french toast are my favorite, though I think they taste better if you go earlier in the morning.There is also free noodles at night after 9:30PM though I've yet to try it. It seems moderately popular as I see people slurping noodles in their hotel pajamas at night sometimes. It's nice though, if you want a late dinner and nothing is open.I personally love the ambience of the rooms. They have cool sliding doors and everything is in a dark wood veneer tone. It feels more modern than most hotels and makes you feel relaxed after a day of exploring. There is also a spa on the second floor, gender separated. There is a code that changes every day for the women's spa that you must obtain at reception. The spa is great for achy muscles; there is a hot bath and cold bath, and even a sauna. I regretfully didn't make use of it last time, but I enjoyed relaxing in the bath. The laundry is also in the same room. Kirkland detergent is provided and you can get a key to lock the machine if you like.I found sometimes the halls can be noisy depending on the guests who stay. I didn't have this experience the last stay, but at some point, I would always hear kids or people talking/screaming loudly in the hall in Korean. I stayed in the Dormy Inn in Sapporo and also had this experience with Korean guests. They seem to stay in separate rooms and would knock loudly (continuously) on the doors at night. But I guess it's not the hotel's fault. Maybe travel during a season with less Korean tourists.There seem to be more English speaking staff available this time, though I mostly communicated in broken Japanese. They were very nice when I checked in. I left my baggage with them as it was early, and when I came back later in the evening, they had already sent it to my room.The hotel is a bit tricky to find. If you can, I recommend getting off at Harajuku Station with your luggage rather than Shibuya Station. The path has less obstacles and weird bumps in the ground. It is located in an alleyway off Meiji Dori. There's a Chinese restaurant called Bamiyan lit in pink across the street from the alley. It's a hard sign to miss, so when you see it, turn into the alley in front of you. It will be on your right from Harajuku, if coming from Shibuya, it'll be the left. They offer free shuttle service to Shibuya Station for guests checking out. But it only goes until about 12PM and you have to book in advance. I hope to come back soon! I miss it already.","September 2, 2017","5    Dormy inn Premium Shibuya Jingumae

283,"We stayed for 2 nights at the beginning of our trip and the last night before flying back to the States. We loved this hotel and especially enjoyed the late night Ramen which was perfect for our jet lag hunger and the breakfast. We didn't have the breakfast for the first 2 nights of our trip and we we're so envious of the spread when we woke up super early and desperate for food. Not many places in the area were open for breakfast (something we learned about Japan in general), but we did find good eats in nearby Harajuku at the Yoshinoya(sp?). It's the Japanese version of fast food and I believe its 24hours but it's fantastic! Super fresh and high quality. I had the beef and Salmon and it was my first traditional Japanese breakfast which I loved. Long story short, opt for the breakfast at Dormy but if you don't you have options at Harajuku.","August 18, 2017","5    Dormy inn Premium Shibuya Jingumae

285,"The Hot Spring Dormy Inn Premium Shibuya Jingumae is such a long name. That's the first thing I remember thinking. Besides the free ramen at night (tastes fine for being free), I think it's main strong points are location and friendly staff. Price... not so much. I'd give this 3.5 stars if I could. The location is pretty good, as Harajuku and Omote-sando are interesting and convenient neighborhoods, and you can do a longer walk to Shibuya... but if you're traveling via metro and walking, be aware that getting here from Meiji-jingu Mae station is a lot faster than Harajuku station... if you're walking from the latter, you have to do a U-turn/fishhook shaped turn to get the hotel (you're on the right path if you pass a Starbucks on your right, just before you turn left for the U-turn). You can't take what seems like the shortest route from the map, due to wire fences blocking the way. It's hard to tell from the map, so be forewarned.. once you get close though, finding it on the side street is pretty easy.Checking in was easy, as every worker in the hotel seemed friendly. I could tell they are accustomed to serving foreign customers. I quickly got to my room. It was about the normal size for a Tokyo hotel; the bed was not large, but comfortable enough. AC worked well, as did the free wifi. The TV is only medium sized, but I believe there was an English language channel or 2. A small fridge was handy for the summer. The bathroom is your usual fairly cramped affair, with just enough sink space. The shower was not a bathtub, but a stand-up type... not my favorite, as the ones in Japan tend to feel wanting for space. Everything seemed clean though, and overall I had no issues with housekeeping. I never really had a problem with outside noise. On my last day, checking out was pretty easy. The hotel also has other amenities, like the bath, which I didn't get to check out due to time constraints. The biggest weak point is the price - for what you pay, it feels like it should be a little nicer hotel. I agree with others who said the price is a bit too high for what you get, even with the amenities. Overall it's a decent establishment though, comfortable enough for a few days. I could picture returning sometime.","August 3, 2017","5    Dormy inn Premium Shibuya Jingumae

Half Japanese and half Western, the chef who puts this out clearly takes great pride because this would easily be a $30 breakfast buffet back in NY!Now for the hotel, the rooms were nice but small, but similar to other typical Japanese hotels.

The hotel do offer free Ramen noodles in the evening too, but unfortunately we had plans and missed out. LOCATION - pretty much equidistant from Harajuku and Shibuya. The hotel doesn't look like anything special from the exterior but I side is pretty good. FACILITIES - Hotel comes with Spa/Laundry Machines/free ramen in the evening.

The hotel staff were reasonably helpful, but for some reason they were very aggressive about collecting breakfast tickets. And, unfortunately, there is only limited seating in the breakfast area, which meant that many guests had to eat in the rather dull conference room adjoining the breakfast area. The food itself, however, was good.

299,We stayed here in April 2017 for 2 nights. The hotel is located around 5-7 minutes from JR Shibuya station and around 7-10 minutes from JR Harijuku station. We arrived at around 10:30pm and check in was easy and quick. The staff we dealt with spoke English very well. We had a double room which was on par for Japanese room sizes. The room was clean and well appointed. We ate breakfast in the restaurant on level 1 both days and found it to have a good selection of Japanese and western options. Between 9:30 and 11pm nightly they offer free noodles in the restaurant on level 1. There is a convenient shuttle bus which will take you to Shibuya station in the mornings. This service finishes at 11:30 on week days and 12:00 on weekends. There is a spa on level 2 which can be used by guests. Women require a separate spa coupon. Overall it was a very comfortable stay with excellent staff and the hotel is in a great location.

300,"The little bathhouse downstairs is cute and a really nice perk. So is the ""wall of pillows"" along the entrance to the bathhouse, where you can choose from many different styles and firmness...each one neatly nestled in a bag with pillowcase already on it. Other useful amenities: a scale for weighing baggage in the lobby, and a branch of Yamato delivery service just across the street so if you want you can have your bags delivered to the airport instead of shlepping them around.Rooms are small...but not impossibly small. It's clean. Like all Japanese hotels they are very strict about check-in and check-out times (and check-out here is early!) Staff is helpful and my bag was waiting in my room when I returned later at night.Breakfast is OK. Would have rather paid less and not had it included.The only real problem is this place is not at all as convenient as it looks. On the map it seems perfect: catty-corner from ""Cat Street"", smack dab in between Shibuya and Harajuku, but really it's not that close to either. If you have a lot of luggage, forget it. The Chiyoda subway line is fairly close but JR is not. They do have a shuttle bus to Shibuya station but there's a lot of construction right now (not the hotel's fault) so it often takes longer on the bus than it would to walk. So you need to give yourself extra time and fortitude.Also, it's not a residential area at all. Finding a coffee shop or pub for a late night meeting turned out to be impossible. On the plus side, Kyushu Jangara-ramen, which is pretty good and very foreigner friendly, is nearby.","April 12, 2017","5    Dormy inn Premium Shibuya Jingumae

311,"I booked this hotel because it was high atop Trip Advisor's list of Best Value hotels in Tokyo. Either that ranking is unwarranted or Tokyo hotels in general provide little value. (This was my first visit.) After my outstanding experience at Cross Hotel Kyoto, this one felt a bit shabby. The hallway was hot, as was the room when I got there. The thermostat instructions were in Japanese, so it took awhile to get the temperature to normal (Googling the serial number bailed me out). The bathroom was a couple inches off the main floor, making it easy to stub one's toe. The water pressure in the sink was inadequate. The shower head was portable, but the fixture for it was inflexible, so getting a comfortable angle was not possible. That said, it was easy enough to get a good night's sleep, and the location was good (walkable to the heart of Shinjuku and to trains, but in a quiet area). Your options might be better in other neighborhoods -- I would try Harajuku or Koenji on my next visit.","June 25, 2019","2    Hotel Sunroute Higashi Shinjuku

312,"As with all Japanese hotels, this hotel is very small. However, it is very clean and quiet.I contacted the hotel prior and they shared 3 ways of getting there:1. The most convenient wayTaking ''Airport limousine bus'' (120min. 3,100Yen) to Busta Shinjuku, then take taxi from there to our hotel (10min. approx. 800 Yen) or walk to Shinjuku Nishiguchi station of Oedo line (subway) and take Oedo line to Higashi Shinjuku Station (1 stop). We are very close to B2 exit.2. Faster wayTaking ''JR Narita Express'' (train) to Shinjuku station (90 min. 3,190Yen), then take taxi from there to our hotel (10min. approx. 800 Yen) or walk to　Shinjuku Nishiguchi station of Oedo line (subway) and take Oedo line to Higashi Shinjuku Station.3. The fastest and cheapest wayTaking Keisei Skyliner (train) to Ueno station (40 min. 2,500Yen), then walk underground street (10 minutes) to Ueno Okachimachi station of Oedo line (subway) and take Oedo line to Higashi Shinjuku Station (15 min. about 230 Yen).I went with Option 3 and it was pretty convenient. Go to Exit B2, turn left.

313,"My husband and I recently spent two weeks in Japan, and the first three days were here in Tokyo.The room was tiny by American standards but that’s just the way it is everywhere in Japan unless you’re willing to shell out some Big Yen. Besides, why would we want to stay in our room for anything other than sleeping and washing up? So, the room was fine. It was clean, and the bed was comfortable. Check-in and check-out was easy, and the staff spoke some English.The location is great. It’s in Shinjuku (the entertainment district) but on the outer edges where it’s a bit quieter. There are plenty of bars, restaurants, and shopping within an easy walking distance.We paid a little extra and got the breakfast buffet included during our stay. You go through the lobby to get to the restaurant next door – The Royal Host. It’s a chain restaurant comparable to a Denny’s I guess. You exchange your breakfast ticket (that you get at the hotel when you check-in) for a card to leave on the table that tells others it’s occupied. You flip the card over to show that you’re done and then leave.The buffet itself has a wide variety of options. There are the standard western breakfast staples like scrambled eggs, bacon, and fruit as well as traditional Japanese items like rice, miso soup, netto (fermented soy beans), pickled veggies, and a variety of fish. It’s nothing fancy but it will fill you up.The only issue we had with the hotel was actually finding it. We landed in Narita after a 13 hour flight, took JR’s Narita Express into the city and got off in Shinjuku Station. The station is absolutely enormous, crowded and overwhelming … especially if you haven’t slept in 24 hours. We stumbled around a while trying to find the train to the Higashi Station until we discovered that you have to switch from the JR line to the city’s Metro system. Once we understood that everything was fine.So, overall, this is a fine base of operations while you enjoy this fabulous city!","June 9, 2019","2    Hotel Sunroute Higashi Shinjuku

Upon arrival my friend and I had to pay extra for twin beds instead of a single bed even though our reservation specified (and we showed our confirmation) twin beds. We were then informed that to make local phone calls we would have to pay a fee if we used the hotel phone. We would also be charged for using the TV (mind we weren’t looking to rent anything, just watch local channels). When asked if the hotel could call us a taxi my friend was told they would charge us and when I later asked they flat out told me no because it was too early (it was 8am).

Check out so much faster.The rooms are so small, however I’m guessing this is the normal. My husband and l felt like we stood on top of each other however only in the room to sleep. T.v. Only has BBC as the English Channel but have option to pay for movies.The room was clean and bathroom had shower over a tub and was very clean.

335,"We stayed at this hotel due to the location and the price. I thought I was prepared for the size of the rooms in Japan but I was not. The room we had was tiny, the bed was up against the wall, there was not enough room for both our suitcases, so they had to be closed against the wall in order to move around the room. There is not enough space for both people to move around the room, so be prepared.  The hotel itself is fine, it is an average 3 star hotel. We certainly did not pick it because it was luxurious. However, it was very clean, the cleaning staff were very friendly and we had no issues with noise at all during our stay. The staff on the front desk were not very friendly and would ignore you as you arrive back to the hotel in the evening. The location is excellent you are talking about a 10-15 minute walk into the centre of Shinjuku. There is so much to see along the way that you wont even notice the walk. I cannot fault the location at all. The hotel is located on what seemed to be a main roadway and its basically a straight walk into the centre. Its probably more of a 20-25 minute walk to Shinjuku station. I would advise getting a taxi from the station to the hotel with your luggage as its too far to walk with luggage. If you are staying here, you would be staying here out of pure convenience of the location and for the price of the room, nothing more.","January 3, 2019","2    Hotel Sunroute Higashi Shinjuku

We love the hotel because it’s 1) super clean and modern (newly renovated again), 2) quiet rooms (hotel faces lower traffic street, windows sound-insulated, high floor, and quiet fellow travelers in hallways), 3) located within 50m of entrance-B of Higashi-Shinjuku station where 2 subway lines can be accessed and 2 stops from the big Shinjuku Sta., 4) lots of convenience stores nearby, 5) nice English-speaking staff, 6) relatively inexpensive, and 7) walkable to parks, shopping, night life, and restaurants. Most hotels we stayed at have very firm (hard) beds and pillows but this hotel had one of the softer ones.","November 28, 2018","2    Hotel Sunroute Higashi Shinjuku

339,"Stayed here for 6 nights while holidaying in Tokyo with my sister. Reception staff were formal but pleasant. We booked the economy double to try and keep the price reasonable as Tokyo hotel prices are expensive, but we had not realised how small the room would be and there was only just enough floor space around two sides of the bed to put our suitcases down, so we had to constantly step over them to get into bed. Room was clean though and the location to the metro station is amazing as it's just next door.","November 26, 2018","2    Hotel Sunroute Higashi Shinjuku

343,"I spent a week at the Sunroute Higashi in October of this year. Checking in the staff was friendly and helpful and speak reasonable English. Our room was 14 sq.m which is about standard in Shinjuku. The decor of the room made me feel at home so I had no problem sleeping well at night or taking a good afternoon nap.What I really liked about this hotel is that they give a good discount for long stay which I believe is four days or more, and their breakfast buffet. I stuffed myself each morning with potatoes. bacon and perfect scrambled eggs. My Asian wife had a wide selection of Japanese food to choose from. Now the reason why I mention the breakfast buffet is that food in Tokyo is very expensive and you can easily save 2000 yen by eating at the buffet before going out sightseeing. Speaking of sightseeing, this hotel is located just a few yards from a minor metro station which is easy to navigate but which can take you anywhere in Tokyo. It is a short walk to korea town with some very good restaurants and there is a mini mart not far away. In conclusion one can save money and energy staying at this hotel.","October 24, 2018","2    Hotel Sunroute Higashi Shinjuku

The Higashi-Shinjuku hotel is located a short walk north of Shinjuku Station (and about a minute walk to H-S Station). It is close to tons and tons of food/drink outlets and is in an ideal location right next to Golden-Gai - you can drink all night and forget about last trains! The staff service was exceptional and the fact that there are money changing machines in the lobby is a big bonus too.

Plenty of food choices nearby and some are 24-hrs. Economic choice of stay.The greatest disappointment, and certainly a more helpful act would be needed here, was that the hotel refused to assist in restaurant reservation (never mind it was a Michelin-star). Before check-in I was told that my credit card details were needed before they could proceed. Ended up was told that they simply did not provide assistance at all except language support.

The room is a standard room , small room is Japan trademark but it’s next to higashi shinjuku station.

Compare to shinjuku is less convenient but the train route are more easier.

352,"There was a lot of things we liked about this hotel during our eight-day stay, but the convenience of its location clearly tops the list. It is literally just one door away from the subway entrance. Considering that Tokyo is a subway intensive city, this fact goes a long ways. We also enjoyed staying in Shinjuku. Visiting other Tokyo districts, we felt we took the right decision staying in that neighborhood.But everything else was great as well. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful, always ready to provide some change for your money or lend power adapters or make reservations for a special dinner (in this regard, please honor any reservations you make, because foreigners missing their restaurant reservations has been an issue in Tokyo lately, from what I read).As with any property in this price range in Tokyo, the rooms are small and Sunroute makes this very clear on their website. We had reserved a standard double, but when we got to the room we concluded that because of our luggage we would not be comfortable. We checked with the front desk and fortunately they had a slightly larger room available for an upgrade, which was fine for us.Amenities included a hair dryer, slippers, bathrobes, and good-quality toiletries. The shower was powerful and mattress and bedding were exceptionally comfortable. As with just about everything in Japan, the room was spotlessly clean.On the second floor, there are coin-operated washers and dryers, something very convenient for longer travels. We used and found them very convenient and easy to use.Breakfast is not included in the basic rate, but you can have this meal at the adjoining restaurant (Royal Host) for JPY 1,030, a steal for the generous buffet they offer. Get your voucher at the reception.In a nutshell, I believe one cannot find a better hotel deal in Tokyo in this price range.","July 30, 2018","2    Hotel Sunroute Higashi Shinjuku

The bathroom is a nice size, the room had storage space for suitcases. Honestly couldn't fault the hotel really.Location wise, the B2 exit from the metro is like a minute walk from the hotel. The main transport in Japan is train, so if you have never been before, this hotel is a perfect location for you, as you can get around the city quite easily from this hotel.There is also shops close by and a Mcdonalds, which always is handy !

Loved that it was near all the other subway lines which required interchange of lines. It was also only a stop away from the main Shinjuku Line where the Odaykyu Romance Car was to travel to Hakone and other parts of Tokyo. it is also within walking distance to Shinjuku itself.

Upon arrival, the hotel surpassed my expectations for a few reasons. It’s right next door to Higashi-Shinjuku station (direct line- 4 stops to Shibuya station or even Yokohama) and just a 10 minute walk to the neon-lit centre, where most of the restaurants are, as well as the big department store, ‘Isetan’ - worth visiting the basement level for their food hall and trying lots of different things!The hotel itself is spotless and the staff are very welcoming and helpful. The rooms are bigger than the last hotel I stayed in (APA Hotel) with desk space, mini fridge & kettle, a small rail to hang clothes and a full double bed (for single occupancy). Note, the room size is still not huge which is typical for Tokyo. The bathroom also has a mini bath and all the toiletries you need - I didn’t once use my own in the end.I also had the best sushi of my stay in Tokyo just around the corner at ‘Sushi-Zambia Higashi Shinjuku’ - check it out!Would definitely recommend this hotel.","June 5, 2018","2    Hotel Sunroute Higashi Shinjuku

361,"There are a few high points here; the sky view bar, the breakfast choice and the generally good service. This is let down for me at least by a few things. Some easy to fix, some not so easy.My room was very small, normal for Tokyo maybe but for me, very small. The toilet for example has a half width door that misses the toilet by millimetres on opening and a only had a half sized bath. The decor is dated and a little shabby and in my case, although a non smoking room, stank of stale cigarettes, the carpet too was stained and in generally poor condition. One complimentary bottle of water is provided, with more available in the mini bar at £5 for 500ml.... not acceptable in my opinion. The last ‘equivalent’ hotels I stayed in the last two months provided multiple free bottled water. (Sofitel Sentosa Singapore, Wanda Reign Shanghai). The hotel has reasonable facilities, a free 24h gym (gets quite busy), a sauna and a 20m outdoor pool (£30 a time though, even for guests) so understandably empty. This by the way is the ONLY outside space in the hotel, so if you want to sit outside and read a The water thing and £30 for the pool is a bit of a rip off in my view. Small rooms I get, Tokyo isn’t a big place but for nearly £250 a night I’m not prepared to put up with dated, shabby decor, carpets and a smoky room.

I know my company paid for this room, but as a Spire member, you would think I’m at least get my welcome points or complimentary drink, or acknowledged as a Spire member. Nope, I had to give them my number, asked for my points, like begging for 600 points! Hahaha, I have been to other IHG properties when my company paid for my stays, and I was given my welcoming amenities without asking for its. Then to my room, the pictures speak for itself. Molds in the bathtub, Japanese love to take their baths, I was gonna such, but for sure I won’t be bathing in this tub. On the the sofa chairs, I can safely said I won’t be sitting on its. Anyway, IC never consistent with how they treating their loyal customers when it’s come to weather you paid for your stays or your company does. So disappointed.

372,"The hotel breakfasts are fantastic- probably the best, day after day, in a top quality hotel anywhere in the world! The huge range of foods appealed to the mainly Japanese, Chinese, Indian and European palates. Amazing!The hotel was full when we checked in and we were allocated a very small cramped double even though it had all the equipment but just felt claustrophobic.We got an upgrade, and apart from sealed windows (no fresh air) this new room was great.The other restaurants and bars in the building are well presented, all with charming staff, high quality food at lunchtimes and dinner. The only shocks are the minuscule centimetres of wine for truly exorbitant prices. The cheaper malt whiskies are just OK.The concierges tried hard but we struggled with tubes, trains and taxis and finding the names of shops and restaurants around the Dome and the Ginza areas often standing outside but failing to see them on our google searches.","June 2, 2019","7    ANA InterContinental Tokyo

373,"I made reservations here as this is the best located Intercontinental in Tokyo. Reviews made me hesitate, but after our stay, I was very satisfied. Before we arrived, I requested a paid upgrade to a Premier room. These rooms have been renovated. We had used a 2 for 1 coupon for 2 nights and points for our other 3 nights.All in all, I like this hotel. The location is excellent. The Airport Limo bus makes a stop at this hotel from both Tokyo airports. The hotel is close to 2 metro stops. There is a huge amount of places with a 1/2 mile to eat. There are many restaurants in the hotel. There is a small coffee/pastry shop as well. The hotel's breakfast buffet is very large but a little high priced. We did the buffet once. We had 2 mornings that we had to be out of the hotel by 7AM, so doing a buffet isn't worth it.The room was a decent size and very clean. The room size was more like an American hotel room. I found the bathroom again, very clean and decently sized. I do not understand these complaints about the bathroom being small. We had a king bed room. We had a sitting area with a loveseat. Which I used for one of our suitcases. Overall, I felt we had plenty of room. I did much research and then chose to pay for a small upgrade to get a renovated room. I think it was $25 US and seeing other room pics, it was definitely worth $25.Service in the hotel was very good. The concierge and the bell captain were both very helpful to us.Would we stay here again? Yes, providing that a good rate was available.","June 1, 2019","7    ANA InterContinental Tokyo

375,"I had a mixed experience at this hotel and felt there was a large difference between the hotel generally and the Club Intercontinental - it was like 2 different hotels. On arrival after a long flight and transfer via the limousine bus we found the entrance unattended by any staff, there were no bell staff to assist with luggage. The bus drops passengers at the level below the lobby where the reception is located so you need to navigate a large lower level, find the elevators and take your luggage upstairs yourself. This was contrasted with the hotel the bus stopped at before we arrived at the Intercontinental. At that hotel, there were multiple bell staff waiting to greet the bus and passengers with trolleys for the luggage and a friendly greeting. I was quite surprised that Intercontinental didn't have even 1 staff member available. I expressed my disappointment about this on checkin, but the staff member didn't seem to be concerned about this, there was certainly no apology given. As I had a Club Intercontinental room I should have been directed to the club for checkin, however I was kept standing at the main reception for checkin. Again, after a long flight I would have preferred to go straight to the club.The 'other' hotel, the club experience was excellent. The staff are exceptionally warm and helpful, taking time to chat to guests and provide assistance, information and tips about Tokyo. Breakfast was exception with 3 or was it 4 seperate menus. I had the breakfast from the french restaurant which was very innovative, along with a traditional western breakfast. Afternoon tea and evening canapés were available, but unfortunately they didn't vary from day to day. The room was newly refurbished and very comfortable. Blackout blinds ensured a restful sleep, and the room was very quiet. There were very limited English speaking channels on TV and I was disappointed that there were no pay to view movies available. I used the gym one morning, but after that preferred to walk around the local area in the morning. The subway is very handy and there are a range of places to eat in the Ark shopping centre next door. The main hotel lobby area was always very busy and crowded when I passed through, again in contrast to the peace and calm atmosphere in the club.","May 26, 2019","7    ANA InterContinental Tokyo

376,"Having a group visiting this hotel, on their arrival at 5pm, their keys were not ready and they had to wait for the keys. After a long flight from the USA, this is not a way you want to start your travel experience. They had given our keys out to a larger group of the Olympic Committee and here we are a 4th time repeat group waiting. I found that very inconsiderate and selfish of this hotels management staff decision making. And our reservations were 2 years advance reserved! Bad Form!

Decor is a little tired and I was expecting more for an Intercontinental. Staff was very helpful and service was good. They offer a very extensive breakfast and we had a very nice (but pricey) meal at their steakhouse. Feel it is more like a 3.5 but willing to round up given the service.

380,"We booked this hotel during the golden week with my friends. As IHG ambassador member I was expecting a lot of this property. I have requested the price to take the club intercontinental to the reservation of the hotel they ask me to pay 200€ extra per night and per room for that witch is the exact amount difference between the rate paid and the club room rate. Usually I get 20% discount with my membership status. When we arrived my room was beautiful but the bathroom was too small and they are not doing turndown at night. The sofa of my friend’s room was stained and burned by cigarette and the room furnishings were horrible. After complaining about the second room the first response were « we are aware of the rooms in poor conditions » but they continue to sell it, it was taking two nights of our 4 nights stay for my friend to change room. The second thing is that avoid to go to the cascade restaurant just to have coffee, they charged us 3250¥ for two coffees it’s unacceptable for just American coffee. Then we wanted to book a sukiyaki restaurant we had the name of the restaurant and ask the concierge to book it. Even with a simple restaurant booking we had an issue again they book a different restaurant.The only goods points were the bars of the hotel the Mixx bar on 36th floor with beautiful views is amazing, the champagne bar on lobby floor with very professional and kind staff and to finish the Da Vinci bar and cigar lounge to have a good after-dinner cocktail.In my opinion it will be better for you to avoid this property which is not up to the intercontinental standard. There is an other intercontinental in Tokyo Bay witch is much better than this one.","May 7, 2019","7    ANA InterContinental Tokyo

383,"Have just had a six night stay at this hotel and have had a great experience there. Right from the start the Reception Staff were very helpful and as it was our first time at the hotel gave us a free room upgrade (two room levels according to what they said) giving us a room on the 30th Floor (3025). The room was spacious with a very large, comfortable double bed. Mattress was lovely and the pillows gave just the right amount of support. Good size flat screen TV with two English channels available, well stocked mini bar (Not used), room safe, settee, desk space and chair. Good lighting and air con as well. Also had a Nespresso coffee machine which saw a lot of use from me. The bathroom was large with the WC having heated seat and all the bells and whistles you expect from a Japanese toilet. (Wifey now wants to find out how we got one like it in the UK!) There was even a TV in the bathroom although no English channels on that one. The bath itself was just about big enough for an average sized woman to bathe in should she desire but us bigger types would not be able to lay out in it. That said the shower was powerful and hot so no problem for me. Usual good quality toiletries available if needed including a Pandora's box of goodies like sewing kits, cotton buds and the like. The room was quiet enough for a good nights sleep and the air-con quiet enough it could be left on overnight without disturbing you - something i appreciate being a very light sleeper. We cannot comment on the food available at the hotel even though there a number of restaurants forming part of the hotel experience. For out taste we felt they were all quite expensive with even the basic breakfast buffet starting at over 2000Y a head (£14 at the current rate of exchange)We felt the hotel was well located with access to the subway only about a hundred yards from the lobby (with a Doutor Coffee Shop right next to it if you need it) Family Mart and 7/11 also close by. Al the staff we encountered were incredibly helpful and most spoke very very good English.

390,"My April trip to Japan was timed to perfection with the cherry blossoms open in full bloom. Unfortunately it also meant that all hotels in Tokyo were full or at exorbitant rates. The ANA was the only place available.Couple of points to note:1. Location wise, Akasaka and where the ANA is located are not the most convenient of locations. It’s a bit of a walk to the metro station, so not quite your tourist hotel.2. The property itself is quite old. It didn’t look as though it changed much from when I was last there (15yrs ago) though I’m sure it’s had a face lift in most parts of the hotel.3. Be mindful that some of the rooms (singles can be VERY small 22sqm).The experience for me as a whole was fine. 1. Check-in was smooth (✅) 2. Staff very courteous (✅)3. Room was decent (32sqm) (✅)4. The bathroom was a bit outdated (❌)I would recommend that when booking you ask for a queen bed or double. Don’t eat at the hotel, there are great places to eat around Akasaka and Ginza and roppongi are close enough if you want to splurge and eat. When checking out avoid 7:00-7:15am. I made the mistake of thinking it was early enough and I should be fine and done in 15mins. At that time there were only two people at the front desk and all it took was one guy checking out to ask a hundred and one questions for the line behind me to go 10 deep. After 7:15am I noticed (or maybe the hotel finally noticed) that there were 4 more people helping out with check outs, but it didn’t help me as I was first in line and there for 20mins just waiting.","April 8, 2019","7    ANA InterContinental Tokyo

It is a poor version and twice the price.Bad points-the porter broke my case by splitting the zip. Accidents happen. However the reception giggled and offered me no help with it at all.-my partner booked the hotel. Apparently even though I had paid for it and had my ihg card and stayed for four days they wouldn’t honour any of the rewards as my name wasn’t the lead name on the booking-the rooms are tiny - I mean really tiny!-the water in the rooms had an expiry date of 2015 (its 2019)- the bathroom was tired, had a style of 1970s avacado plastic and the grouting was dirty-our bed wasn’t made because we didn’t notice that you had to leave a plastic card on the bed to tell the maid you wanted it made(what?!?!)-the hotel bars and reception are by far the most expensive place to eat and drink we found in the city. And it isn’t worth it! The same beer and wine a few feet away will cost about a fifth of the price- when we arrived we were recommended by reception to drink in the 36th floor bar. Half of which was smoking and the other non. However the bar shares the same air with no divider so it stank. As did our clothes. We had to leave the bar because our throats became sore. When we asked if we could drink anywhere else in the hotel we were told no, they were all closed (it was 10pm)- the minibar is astronomically expensive. With a kit kat costing 5 pounds and a half bottle of cheap wine 30 pounds. Minibars are expensive but.... Good points-the main entrance is prettyOverall, this hotel is greedy, lacks good service and is very tired. I would not recommend anyone comes here. For less money you can stay in far nicer authentic and value for money hotels. If you want to burn money for little return then this is the hotel for you.Ihg - if you would like more information then contAct me. This hotel is letting your brand down.

394,"I wanted to rate this hotel ""Excellent"" because the newly renovated Tori Suite is spacious, well-designed and has a sofa bed which is good for families. The staff at the Club lounge are nice and helpful too. However, the horrible check-in experience and poor housekeeping marred our entire stay. As a Platinum member I had thought that we could get an early check in but we had to wait till 6 pm as the previous guest checked out late. This ruined our plans for the day. We were not offered a complimentary upgrade. In fact, nothing was offered. It wasn't until we voiced our displeasure that we were finally given an extended check out and token points. This is in stark contrast to the Intercontinental Osaka where we were given an upgrade without asking, a welcome fruit basket, a bottle of wine and a personalised note from the GM.Housekeeping too was a disappointment. I noticed fluff from our clothing lying on the carpet after the room was cleaned and the next day I placed a small piece of tissue on the carpet as a test. When we returned in the evening, the tissue was still on the carpet.Platinum members - you'll probably get better value with a regular room.","March 23, 2019","7    ANA InterContinental Tokyo

Within seconds five extra staff were operating on the checkin desk which was a great start, the customer always comes first and they were demonstrating that. The room was a nice size, bed was a bit soft, and pillows were a choice of very soft or very hard which was unusual. I had a twin room to myself and the pillows were the same on both beds. Breakfast had a good choice, I tended to go quite early and noticed the queue was quite long around 8-8:15am when leaving, perhaps the breakfast area is a bit small for the size of the hotel.

Very clever.Bed was big and comfy and the all important pillow was great.Breakfast was pretty standard for this sort of hotel with a lot of choice and the all important omelette chef.Things I didn’t like.Lifts are slow, but at least they indicate which lift to wait in front of - forever.Gym - big a well lit but pretty standard equipment with no spin bikes (someone tell them that cycling is getting bigger and those typical hotel bikes with plush seats, one adjustable setting and an old screen are so yesterday). Also needs more space for yoga/stretching.Last but certainly not least, I had lunch at the Atrium restaurant and had a rather good burger with two, 190ml bottles of coke. Just got the bill (literally just now) and found it was AUD60 not including tip (“service charge”) and tax. The coke alone was AU$12.Seriously? OMG I hate to think what my 2x bourbon cost last night.....Would stay again tho, good location.BTW, the additional questions below are, while a nice thought, not really relevant to a great many travellers.","February 26, 2019","7    ANA InterContinental Tokyo

399,"We stayed here for 4 nights for a few days holiday before a business engagement in Tokyo. We had booked a Kaze suite (upgraded from the level below with Ambassador IHG group). The suite on the 32nd floor had a living area with sofa, table and chairs, TV and bar. Next to it was the bedroom and bathroom, separated with a sliding door. The room was very clean, cozy and practical. We also had access to the lounge on the 35th floor. The lounge at this hotel is huge with a lounge area, dining area and business corner. You can also use a small meeting room if needed. The lounge serves breakfast and warm+cold tapas for dinner time. The quality of the food was excellent. It's always quiet so you can really relax. We also went to MiXX lounge and bar for Saturday brunch. That was another outstanding experience with a wide range of Italian inspired food. The King Crab legs were awesome. We also had breakfast at the ground floor restaurant once. It has a huge variety of food (Japanese, Chinese, western) but it can get busy there between 8 and 9. The staff at the hotel is extremely helpful and very efficient. No problem with English language at all. I wholeheartedly recommend the ANA InterContinental Tokyo.","February 21, 2019","7    ANA InterContinental Tokyo

It was smoother & more quiet than others we’d been on. Given that it’s probably a newer model but they have a nicer place to plug in our phone charger, a removable remote for our tv and a comfy headset. Oh and they have this awesome feature on their windows. You can adjust how dark or light it is without closing anything. It was so awesome! So you can make it darker so the sun won’t shine through like a car window tint but still be able to see outside!! How awesome! Sadly we didn’t get a window seat this time. The food wasn’t too bad either. We had rice & curry with cold noodles and fruits. Our 10-11 hrs flight went more comfortably than we had hoped.

She is a credit to the MO organisation. In fact, all staff that we dealt with were excellent, including housekeeping who we never saw in person but clearly did great work.The cocktail bar is well worth a visit. Great drinks, very well managed by the engaging Fu-Fu (hope I got her name correct) and a superb night view over Tokyo from the non-smoking section (yep, Japan still allows smokers to puff away indoors - so 1980's!). The rest of the hotel looks to be non-smoking.If you want to eat at the hotel's Michelin Starr 'Tapas Molecular Bar' get your reservation made before you turn up.

It's pricey but it's more than just a meal - it's entertainment too - and be sure to get the wine paring.In my opinion, the Mandarin Oriental Tokyo is so much nicer than the Shangri-La just down the road.","March 27, 2019","8    Mandarin Oriental, Tokyo

The staff (they don't like to be singled out but they are exceptional team: Front Desk Jenny Miu, Nao, Niko, Osamu, Maria; in restaurant, Eita, Yuka, Yu, Luca) keep bringing us back, even when our trip doesn't include Tokyo, we make a point of staying here! Jenny and Niko even helped us with MO Bangkok and Hong Kong stays. Excellent Japanese service, but warm and friendly, too; so generous with their hospitality, have earned our loyalty.

441,"I read some of the lower rated reviews to see what the possible issues were and I think most have been addressed - the service is great, most staff speak good English and the rooms are spacious and comfortable. The only remaining one is that smoking is allowed in the bar on 37 which floats up to reception. I think it’s time that the MO Tokyo got with the rest of the 21st century and banned smoking in the public areas. Why should one or two people spoil the space for everyone else??

442,"Second time to Tokyo and the first time to MOTYO. After the visit, for sure you will return to this FANtastic hotel.  Spacious room and I am really impressed that as usually the hotel rooms in Japan are quite small. I am so surprised for the amazing view from the room which seems like just a short distance to the Skytree Tower. Stunning View no matter in the morning, evening or night time!!!!  Bathroom amenities are luxurious by using BV and all amenities are available. The bath salt with great scent and always great to use it for the relaxation after the long shopping day at daytime.  Convenient location, connected to the Metro, shopping mall, convenient store with 2 mins walk. Only 10 to 15 mins to Ginza by Metro. For arrival and departure to or from airport, you may also take the Airport Limousine Bus (additional charge) and just around 1.5 hour to be arrived.  The staff are helpful. Especially I got the assistance of transfers arrangement from Bell and restaurant recommendations from Concierge. They won't suggest the over-fancy one and always give me the one that suitable my needs and budget!!  For Front Desk, they are all friendly and efficient for the room allocation as I have arrived to the hotel in the early morning which they try very best to accommodate the available room for me as soon as they can!!! Highly appericated!!!!!!  For Housekeeping Team, SUPERB!!!! The amazing thing is they even tidy up my chewing gum and put it in order!!! And I also love the Turn Down service by placing the Essential Oil on the small plate with origami.  For GR team, as I have stayed on 3 March and when I back to the hotel, I found a special gift for Hinamatsuri!!! SURPRISED!!!!  Nice experience and a MUST-TRY hotel if you travel to Tokyo!!!!!!!!!!!!! :)","March 5, 2019","8    Mandarin Oriental, Tokyo

445,"First off, I was a Amex Platinum traveler for 20+ years - they completely screwed up my trip. Booking us 2 twins(which are more like full beds) which would have placed my teen daughters on opposite sides of the hotel floor. Book directly, email them. I was very nervous because after spending 2+ hours and 2 days with AMEX they couldn’t figure it out. Unknown to me Platinum cards travel is just Expedia! Join the MO Fan and get same benefits. And the hotel emailed me to let me know that this would have happened. So here’s where Nao stepped in and despite fully booked because of holiday in Japan, we were able to get adjoining rooms after 3 days. She spoke flawless English and gave me many tips especially to the mochi place in Ginza that is part of turndown. She’s an asset to the hotel. I just felt service that was behind the scenes flawless execution and really trying hard even if things aren’t perfect. Comparable to my other fav hotel Waldorf Astoria in Beverly Hills. My daughter loved the spa and fitness areas there were killer views.The attention to details as you can see are amazing from a pillow bar, mochi to the aromatherapy oil. The views are KILLER! The warm Toto seats and towel bars are super nice touches.Breakfast buffet was too good, going home with a few extra pounds. The eggs are a bright orange and the pancake is not like an American pancake but more like a chiffon cake. Lots of dim sum and Japanese dishes too. The breakfast curry was to die for. The chefs are real serious about serving great food. Omelets and eggs dish lean more toward Eastern style and taste.A week in Japan we were really craving home food and they did accommodate us with pizza room service which was darn good NYC like pizza. I think it was expensive but very tasty.Concierge could be more helpful with dining choices but I found Yelp super helpful. It’s not about what you spend but how good the food is or if like us we want quick meals.Hubby had a $25 orange from their market, he said it was the best orange he tasted. Food looked so perfect it looked fake.Lastly, I’m super happy to stay in this part of town. The other areas are overcrowded with people and being from California and living in hills I felt like Disneyland level of people in a lot of Japan. I really like a quiet hotel where I’m not hearing a lot of guests or staff. I love being way up high too. The BED! Only other bed this comfortable is my own at home. I have major insomnia and this was the only hotel I’ve ever stayed in that I’ve gotten great sleep! I’ve stayed at Four Seasons and other 5 stars all over the world - none in Japan but this was a slice of luxury comfort. I got the aromatherapy pillow and my girls the booster.I recommend wearing layers because the heat is pumped in all over. I had a short sleeve T-shirt with a thin down jacket - was most comfortable. Overheated in cashmere.","February 14, 2019","8    Mandarin Oriental, Tokyo

450,"writing this from Sumba isle and have had earthquakes and tropitcal storms the last couple of days so much apologies for typos etc!On the Tokyo portion of our all-Asia honeymoon, my wife and I were greeted with a warmth and genuineness that was truly memorable. Igor Apratz, the hotel manager himself, was there to greet us in person with Nao Kobayashi, their Guest Relations Officer who was awesome! I really recommending signing up for the free Fans of M.O. program, which gets you complimentary upgrades a free breakfast!Nao, who left us several surprises and touches thoughout our honeymoon stay, whisked us to our upgraded deluxe room (huge and gorgeous btw), prepared this beautiful fresh red rose petal heart display accompanied by these pairs of amazing white swans kissing each other made out of bath towels (I've attached a picture). Now if that wasn't already enough, Nao also greeted us with maybe the most amazing strawberry shortcake that i have ever more. Now Japanese people are known for their mastery of elevating something to an even higher level (more on this later). This strawberry shortcake baked in house and made to say, perfection, would be an understatement. A lot of hotels have restaurants that usually are..eh. But Mandarin Hotel Tokyo has 4 restaurants, 2 of which are Michelin star restaurants and one that should be (more on this later too) and an in house Bakery that is to typical of that Japanese way of perfecting things, perfect artisanal croissants (had lots of those in the morning), perfect strawberry shortcakes with just the right balance of strawberries, and cream and just the right amount of sugar and a swirl of crushed nuts on the outside. I'm still salivating about that. It's not easy to get a cake right in this modern day of mass production but the flaky crust was well, perfection.When we told Nao that my wife was pregnant that we'd prefer to exchange the complimentary bottle of champagne in our honeymoon suite for a bottle of Pellegrino, you know what she did? She got us a bottle So Jennie, a premium non-alcoholic champagne bottled IN FRANCE. I am so grateful for this because the only non-alcoholic champagne or wine I've had is basically glorified grape juice. This was anything but. It tasted like the best grape extracts without any added sugars and by the way it wrapped my palate in ectasy, it must be made the traditional Champagne method or something very similar. Nao taught me something my wife and I will remember the rest of our lives that this is what we will drink every time all of our friends have champagne and we want to join to fun but just sans the alcohol. Breakfast was a delightful joy every morning. The freshest fruits, vegetables, pastries, eggs, dear god, everything was the highest quality. I guess that's what you get for staying a a hotel with 2 Michelin Star restaurants and their own artisanal bakery. Every morning, my wife and I were attended by someone that we found out later was one of their management trainees, Flora Hye Soo Shin who had a musicality and gracefulness in your attentive and warm hospitality and, I really must say, Flora was, I guess in retrospect that every single staff member at the hotel, always looked perfect. Every hair in place, every thread of her uniform perfect. She always remembered that we loved San Pellegrino in the mornings and made sure our glasses were filled always. We always saw Flora at 6:30AM every morning so I was astonished when one evening, on the advice of the executive chef Daniele Cason, we hard core NYers opted to have pizza of all things Pizza Bar 38, we saw Flora in the evening hour, again perfectly coifed, perfectly fresh and perky attending to us at the Pizza bar. OK, two things. What?! Apparently, all the staff at Mandarin Oriental wear multiple hats, have multiples skill sets and tireless dedication to their jobs. When we asked her if she was tired after having served us at 6:30am in the morning and now into the evening, she, without even the slightest hint of fatigue that she was well rested and relished the opportunity to serve us again. Wow. Apparently this must be the culture of hospitality so deeply ingrained in their staff from top to bottom, because honestly the hotel manager Igor, who greeted us late at night when we arrived for our honeymoon, I saw early in the morning as well, fully in command and just like all of the entire staff, crisp, organized but relaxed and running every facet with precision.I need to say one thing about the corporate culture at Mandarin Oriental Tokyo. Their management empowers their staff to go above and beyond, to write us a little personal notes, to take time to really let us know the wonders of what makes them so special.Remember when i mentioned Flora worked the night shift same day after serving us on the breakfast shift at 6:30am. Couple of things i wish to say about that night.1) We ordered and savored our bottle of San Pelligrino sparkling water and declined to order. Flora sensed we would've loved more and she sent a few bottles to our room along with such such a lovely personal note. Kudoes Mandarin Oriental and the hotel Manager Igor. They empower their team members to take initiative and coddle their loyal guests. Bravo. It's the mark of a consumnate hospitality manager to entrust and empower. Says a lot about the top level managers and perhaps even more of their faith and belief in the team all the way down the line. Impressive. This is on top of all the premium fruit plates with HAPPY HONEYMOON written in chocolate from Flora at breakfast! Quick shout out to to the awesome manager Yoji Osada who greets us at the door as we come for our table! What wonderful smiles and Japanese bows all around!2) I want to speak about the Pizza alla Palla Pizzaolo, which is Italian for Pizza Maker. First let’s start with Executive Chef Daniele Cason’s pizza. We are from NYC and for me to talk about Pizza somewhere, well, it is something. Pizza Bar 38 at MO Tokyo is made in the style of Pizza made in Rome for centuries, what they call Pizza alla Palla. Is is truly out of this world and it is NOT easy to make. In my opinion, the best pizza int he world comes from NYC BUT let me qualify. The best Pizza in the world that is made quickly and from mass produced ingredients. Having said that, NYC city, yes, the city that never sleeps, does NOT have the best PIZZA. THE WORLD’S BEST PIZZA, must be made of the WORLD’S BEST INGREDIENTS, the best tomatoes, the best Bufalo Mozzarela and the BEST FLOUR. PiZZA BAR 38 HAS ALL THAT AND THE FLOUR THAT THEY USE IS SLOW MILLED BY MULES TURNING A STONE GRINDER (YES, THE SAME METHOD DONE IN ITALY FOR HUNDREDS IF NOT A THOUSAND OR MORE YEARS. They import it from Italy: Marino Flour, Mulino a Petra Naturale Della Langa. It is wow. Something about using only slow ground flour maintains the heartiness the vitamins the soul of the pizza dough. Modern bleached machine milled flour is just, well, nothingness. No flavor, no body, no soul, much less nutrients. The heat of the machine quick grinding of wheat destroys all that. Pizza Bar 38 at Manarin Oriential makes it exactly like the Romans have done for a millennia. Daniele Cason has shaped and trained Yuichi Ito, his Japanese Pizzaolo in Japan into a Master that leavens the bread for 48 hours until it is a cloud, yes, a cloud of dough, soft as the clouds in the sky if you could actually reach them. The result is the world’s highest finest Pizza crust. No one is better. No one. I actually thought Yuichi was Italian. With his Italian Pizza hat and warm bubbly Italian friendliness, somehow I blocked out in my mind and honestly though he was Italian. He had taken his training so well and sooo soo oud and into his craft that he breathed and lived as master Italian Pizzaolo from Rome. What Hotel in the world, really, has 2 Michelin Star restaurants and better get a 3rd for Pizza 38 or that would truly be a crime against the culinary world. You know sometimes when you see an Academy Award Winning performer and what makes his so good is that he is not acting. He is being. Yuicihi Ito is truly a master Pizzaolo in the centuries old tradition of Roma Italia. Bravissimo to the hotel Manager Igor Apraiz and his team. There are world class hotels and there are world class resorts. Somehow Mandarin Oriental Tokyo has both in one location. mastered I daresay. Truly remarkable. Bravissimo once again.","January 23, 2019","8    Mandarin Oriental, Tokyo

454,"My wife and I just returned from 4 fabulous nights spent at the Mandarin Oriental, Tokyo. The hotel is in an excellent location, with plenty of food and shopping options nearby. The Narita Airport Limousine Bus picks up and drops off at the hotel, for easy access to and from the airport (90 mins.). The metro line (Ginza Line) is conveniently located underneath the hotel, and the entire metro system is extremely user friendly. The hotel is located on the upper floors of a modern building, in Tokyo’s financial district. Our room was on the 31st floor, with crystal clear views of Mt. Fuji. The hotel room (3105) was excellent: modern, large, well appointed, and comfortable. Housekeeping did a great job, and were practically invisible, including the nightly turn-down service. The front desk and Concierge were extremely helpful, courteous, and knowledgeable, and provided great suggestions for places to go and outside dining options. The lobby Ambassador, Chihan Hashimoto, was extremely helpful, and made herself available every time we saw her. She even escorted us out of the hotel during our departure. The daily breakfast buffet is among the best I have ever experienced. We also had dinner in Signature, the hotel’s French restaurant, and our dinner was easily one of the best we have ever experienced (and we have tried the Chef’s tasting menus in many M-O locations). Our server, Nozomi, was delightful, and had great wine and Sake suggestions. We both used the spa facilities, and the men’s area had immaculate water and heat options, with a magnificent view of the city. My wife had a facial, and said the practitioner was a true artiste.We like the Mandarin Oriental brand very much, and have tried many around the world. The Tokyo Mandarin Oriental is a true gem, with high quality staff and personnel, excellent dining and bar options, with modern, beautifully appointed, quiet rooms, in a great location.

We also ate at Tapas Molecular which was amazing and a highlight of our holiday - very expensive (especially with wine pairings) but worth it.Rooms were very comfortable as you would expect and we received lots of nice touches and gifts from the staff - as I say we were made to feel very special.

Rooms are very nice and super clean and in contrast to many other hotels don't smell. Whenever something was convenient to happen it happen due to the attention of everybody.

467,"As city hotels go we found this one average. It did all the basics well, cannot complain about the room other than the lighting in the bathroom which was underpowered particlaury around the basin, that too was undersized and awkward to use, should have been two basins with a decent amount of worktop to place your washbag on. Even the Bottega shampoo & conditioner seemed to have been stuck solid in the bottle.We found the buffet breakfast acceptable but get there too late and it feels like a rush,wolfing down your food before it all gets taken away. The signature eggs benedicte is nice but they must do something about the congealed hollandaise sauce. Surely this is not acceptable?The communal areas we found lacking, whilst running the gauntlet through the smoke filled bar between the two restaurants, this could have been better thought out. The bar was small but provided very good cocktails and drinks but as a non-smoker found it stuffy and the hotel jazz band would grind on you night after night - a little more variety would have been better received. This hotel lacked outdoor space, not surprising being on the 38th floor, maybe then maybe not. We have stayed in city hotels in NY, Bangkok and Seoul that are all high rise blocks and all had outside terraces and rooftop bars that gave you a hit of fresh air and openness. We used the spa once but were uninspired by it. Personally, there was no wow factor in this hotel and we found it sterile and lacking atmosphere, if you are looking for a stay that is well organised and good service then it is fine. Looking for more bang for your buck then this is too vanilla.","November 1, 2018","8    Mandarin Oriental, Tokyo

However Tokyo train station is a huge station so make sure your find the M1 exit and the hotel is in front of you. The hotel has a long tradition and the building is very pretty so many tourists come to the outside of the hotel to take pictures. The breakfast is very tasty, has many choices and surprises. The room is modern and pretty though a bit small but you are in the centre of Tokyo so what can you expect? All staff are very polite, their services are excellent and they can speak good English.

474,"On arrival, I was dropped at the concourse entry. I had to take my bags in myself as there was no porter/doorman outside. I arrived early at 12.30pm and I was recommended to catch the train and go to Harajuku. Unfortunately I spent 3 hours battling crowds and long queues. There was no ability to actually see anything meaningful. Once back at the hotel my room turned out to have only internal views- when it said it was in the dome with concourse views, I expected the external concourse views not inside the train station. I ordered room service and what a disappointment it was. Pate turned out to be terrine- big difference. After a hot nights sleep I had breakfast in the atrium. Also a mistake. I arrived in the last hour of service. The room was incredibly hot. I had to find my own table and then had to chase staff for orange juice which was empty and coffee which they didn't ask me abut when I sat down, I was then trying to quickly eat as they appeared to be packing up. The eggs Benedict that were sitting on the hot buffet were rubbery and semi warm. On check out- I paid the very expensive price and then asked about leaving my bags for a few hours. That was facilitated promptly and with no problem. When I returned to get my bags they were provided to me and I asked about a taxi to the airport and was directed to a taxi stand outside the train station. So, I lugged my bags myself to the taxi stand. Very poor service, particularly when I was travelling alone. ","June 18, 2019","9    The Tokyo Station Hotel

480,"LocationUndisputably the most centrally-located hotel in all of Tokyo. Other hotels can claim to being near a metro station or a major interchange, and that is all good. But this majestic hotel sits directly at the most iconic train station in the country, and a stone's throw from the Imperial Palace. As a result of the convenience, you'll be fast-tracked to all major parts of Tokyo and even areas outside of Tokyo (e.g. Yokohama, Hakone) within 30 mins. The Tokyo Station is also a gold mine for food and shopping. Big malls, shops, and restaurants surround the station, including beneath it. Grab a map of the place and tap on the concierge for advice, otherwise getting lost is definitely a real probability. While the constant hive of activity within the train station can be a heady experience, an air of calm and tranquility greets you the moment you enter the hotel lobby. The crowds and noise give way to gentle instrumental music and polite guests/patrons. It is an amazing transition.Rooms In a word, beautiful. The rooms vary widely in size but are generally spacious across the room categories. Everything about the rooms (and corridors and common areas for that matter) exude class, elegance, refinement. They are tastefully furnished with lovely blend of natural lighting, light marble, wood, and teal carpets, and supplemented with quality luxury fittings.  A harmony of modernity and old world grandeur. These are rooms you will want to spend time in, so don't just use the hotel merely as a convenient base to travel.ServiceFriendly, attentive, and efficient, with good command of English to boot. Japanese hospitality and service excellence go hand in hand, and this is on full display by the staff - from the bell desk, front office, restaurants, and housekeeping. Everything is well-oiled and delivered with pride. The team of staff are clearly very happy to be part of the hotel, and have every reason to be.Food The breakfast at the Level 4 Atrium is not to be missed, not just for the wonderful array of Western and Japanese buffet spread but also for the wonderful restaurant ambience replete with high ceilings and natural light. It is a sight to behold. Be sure to have breakfast included in your room rate, or you'll be missing out on something memorable.Overall value-for-moneyThere are several compelling reasons why the Tokyo Station hotel merits your consideration. The most obvious would be the hotel's incomparable location and its classy service and quality. But it is so much more than that. This is also a hotel with a story - an iconic heritage that has evolved with the development of the country's capital. This is truly an experience beyond luxury. Factor in the competitive room rates, and you will very quickly appreciate all the rave reviews and accolades the hotel has received over the years and why it continues to rank so highly on TripAdvisor. Just to add, the hotel is part of the Small Luxury Hotels collection and is perhaps the crown jewel of the SLH collection. The hotel is proud of its association as displayed by the SLH badges on their uniforms and the collaterals around the hotel. This means that SLH members can look forward to enjoying additional perks like early check-ins/late checkouts, breakfast and possibly even room upgrades. Do therefore consider enrolling for the membership if planning a major stay here. ","May 28, 2019","9    The Tokyo Station Hotel

483,"Summary: I don't know that we can speak highly enough of the courteous, thoughtful staff at The Tokyo Station Hotel! We decided to try the station-view rooms, and we do kind of wish we had a room with an exterior view. If we had to do it over again, we would prefer that (especially to help us get used to the time change after traveling). Pros:*The staff goes above and beyond to make their guests have every comfort imaginable.*We took advantage of the train pick-up service at Tokyo Station, and we were *so* grateful we did. We got lost many times in that station, so it was helpful after 15+ hours of travel to have someone greet us right at the door of our arriving train (N'EX), take our bags, and lead us to check in.*Location. If you're doing a bit of walking, this is fairly central to things we were hoping to see, but also convenient (obviously) to the train station. We walked easily to Imperial Palace, Tsukiji Fish Market, and a few other places.*Bed was pretty comfortable (hard to say for sure because we were fairly jet-lagged!). The curtains were definitely black-out curtains :)*The bathroom had every amenity you could need (hair dryer, toothbrushes, razors, etc). and was nicely updated as well.Con:*Again, probably the room selection we made wasn't our favorite. It wasn't awful either, but I think we would prefer an exterior facing room in the future for some sunlight!","May 24, 2019","9    The Tokyo Station Hotel

486,"Where to begin? From the moment you arrive you are treated so well, from being escorted to your room by the bell hop (please remember no tipping in Japan) who helps you navigate the hotel and also points out the various features of your room.The room has an old world charm with a really big bathroom with separate shower and bath and separate toilet (which was so good I really would love to get a full featured one at home).The location is at what I reckon has to be one of the busiest train stations in the world and yet you hear nothing, it is so well insulated and there is a general sense of quiet and elegance about the place. You are within a short walking distance of the Imperial Palace and its many gardens. Being at the Station you can go to all points within Japan from this station by Shinkansen and most hub lines go through it so its ideal to get around Tokyo as well.We didn’t eat here as it was the pricey side (and there are lots of cheaper options just as good nearby).The one bonus we both enjoyed is that there is an in-house onsen style baths which were clean and marvellous with varying temperature pools (hot and cold) and dry sauna (which was the hottest I had ever been in) with a wide variety of complimentary toiletries so you can turn up with nothing and its a complete service.ProsLocation to the main train station of Tokyo (if not Japan), a true sense of elegance, the fantastic room and service.

I used the Tokyo Station Hotel for my final night for several reasons. + The hotel is centrally located especially if you will be relying on trains. The hotel sits right above the train station and this makes it super convenient for getting around or for a final day to get to the airport with fewer transfers. + The staff is amazing- polite, friendly and willing to help out. The hospitality in Japan is top notch and this hotel definitely delivered. We arrived early before 3 PM check in- they held all our bags for us, and had our bags ready for us in the room. The bellboy walked us to our room, give us a brief history of this 100-year-old hotel (recent renovations- this place is gorgeous) and made us feel welcomed. + Gorgeous hotel, the room was huge with high ceilings and a huge bathroom this was great for our final night to get some rest. The only negative I would say will be to get to the hotel after you get off the train was difficult to find. We ended walking around for a while before we actually found the exit that left us nearest to our hotel. Wish they had more signs underground that lead to the hotel.

Our first room was a Dome Room that was in excellent shape although it was a little on the small side. But the bathroom was large with a separate tub and large shower area.

The room was huge with lots of storage space and beautiful bathroom area and separate powder room. The beds in both rooms were the best that we slept on in the 16 day trip.

We enjoyed the hotel bars and the service from the hotel staff.Tokyo Station is a maze of thousands of people coming and going on the trains and is a sight to witness itself.

491,"this was my first time in Tokyo. I decided to stay in a location that provided transportation. The Tokyo station is a hub for many trains . Tokyo, after reading a lot in guidebooks still seems daunting to me. I decided to stay in the Tokyo station hotel for convenience and luxury. arriving late in the evening I caught one of the last next trains into Tokyo station. Apparently JR Office closes at 9:30 so I was a bit worried on how I was going to get into town. Everything worked out. I was able to get out of immigration quickly. I was given a room that was very far away from checkin.The The room was very comfortable but small. We had to rearrange suitcases to make room for walking. We had a view of buildings that were facing the hotel. The bed was very comfortable. The bathroom and shower were wonderful. I love having a window in my bathroom. The concierge helped us get tickets for the Nazomi train. She also made reservations for the return trip to the airport. She also helped us with restaurants. Plenty of help from the concierge make sure you take advantage. We Had breakfast For the four days that we were there. It was wonderful! much better than the food we encountered in the city! The only negative was that Tokyo station is a huge train and subway hub. I was having siatica problems. The huge station combined with the extra long walk to the room was painful.

492,"It might be Tokyo station that almost travelers from out of Japan firstly drop in. The station has many ticket gates, the gate that the guests staying this hotel should pass through is the Marunouchi South ticket gate. Thereby they will be able to directly access to the hotel. This hotel’s beautiful building is designated the Important cultural property by Japan Government. The whole building was reconstructed from 2006 to 2012 in order to get anti-earthquake reinforcement and restore its original appearance before World War II. For this reason, guests will be able to feel not only just contemporary but also historical atmosphere from the exterior and interior.This hotel has several restaurants, every restaurant is quite wonderful. Especially 'Atrium' provides traditional Japanese breakfast in buffet style, you can enjoy it to your heart's content.＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊","April 20, 2019","9    The Tokyo Station Hotel

493,"We had just a one night stay before leaving Tokyo the next day, but wish we could have just moved in and stayed for a month. We were upgraded (thank you!) to a very large, elegant, and altogether amazing room that was the size of apartment with large seating area, walk-in closet, bar area, and magnificent bathroom. The bed was supremely comfortable. It was very quiet. The view from the room to the front of the hotel overlooking the large courtyard in front of the station was grand. We did not opt for the breakfast buffet so cannot comment on that. The staff was uniformly welcoming and helpful. The location is superb. Overall our one-night stay was one of the best hotel experiences we have ever had.","April 18, 2019","9    The Tokyo Station Hotel

494,"Every stay at historic The Tokyo Station Hotel has been perfect, memorable. At the Hotel, I have stayed in different rooms of different sizes, with different views, but each has been exceedingly comfortable and unique. Furnishings are plush but very functional and logical: lighting is excellent, electrical outlets abound, the bathroom/showers luxurious. Service is always exemplary, the Concierge giving wonderful counsel on everything from viewing azaleas at Nezu Shrine to buying baseball tickets for our next visit. The Tokyo Station Hotel remains a unique gem. Location is excellent, actually in Tokyo Station, steps away from Narita Express arrival, as well as the train from Haneda. The surrounding financial and shopping area, already lively, gets more vibrant with each visit, yet the serenity of the Imperial Palace and its gardens is just a few blocks away.","April 18, 2019","9    The Tokyo Station Hotel

495,"A hotel at the Tokyo station since 1915 with over 104 years old is our first choice of this trip to Japan as we arrived late and need to take a rest before next morning’s Shinkansen trip to Aomori from Tokyo Station. Due to its prime location and heritage and its excellent and professional staff, the hotel rooms are not cheap. It’s like comparing to the peninsula hotel in Hong Kong except that I would prefer them to make bigger and nicer rooms with better amenities as we hardly can put in our 4 suitcases in the room. Our room is the Dome Side Room and it’s facing the inside of the Tokyo station though the windows can’t be opened.Breakfast choice and quality were excellent and service was exceptional too. So if you are looking for a very short stay with the convenience of the location like we did, this is a good choice.","April 14, 2019","9    The Tokyo Station Hotel

507,"This was my second trip to the Tokyo Station Hotel, and I was again very happy to stay here and would recommend it to a friend. The location is inside Tokyo Station (take the South Marunouchi exit), so it is ideal for getting around Tokyo, and the immediate vicinity includes the Imperial Gardens and Marunouchi neighborhood.Everything is clean and functional; the hotel is higher end than the name might initially suggest.Three things to note:1. The corridors run the entire length of Tokyo Station beneath; if you have a room in the 00-20 range, it is a very very, very long walk from the lobby. Try for a room in the 40-50 numbered range.2. Windows in the guest rooms do not open, so you cannot get fresh air.3.

508,"I primarily chose to stay at the Tokyo Station Hotel due to it's close proximity to the Tokyo Marathon finish line (about a block away). But a major bonus is it is literally in the Tokyo Station City complex (6 levels?!). As such, the Narita Express and many of the other Tokyo Metro and JR trains stop there. Also, massive shopping and restaurant options are available. As a single traveler I booked the Palace Side Queen and it was much more than I could have expected: beautifully decorated, the ceilings must have been 12' or higher, a chandelier, foot lighting (new to me!), in room safe, a massive shower head that was a delight and even a heated toilet seat (very new to me but that was great...LOL). This was the first hotel that I have ever stayed where I could not hear any of the adjoining guests. Very quiet with little to no outside street noise either. But, aside from the stunning room, ornate lobby and well-appointed property, the staff are what makes this hotel a 5 Star. Every encounter I had with either the reception or concierge staff was very professional, friendly and genuinely interested in making sure that both my questions were answered and my needs were met. For example, as mentioned above, the Tokyo Station complex is massive spanning at least 6 levels and is a city in itself. As such, it can be a bit overwhelming trying to learn the layout and operation. The hotel staff offer to meet you when the NEX Narita Express train enters the station and guide you through the maze to the reception area (they will cheerfully provide the same service in reverse when you leave). One member of this amazing team I have to give a special nod of appreciation to is Ms. Miyuki Saito. She was a real joy to interact with and always had a very warming smile for me when I saw her. In addition, as I entered the hotel after the marathon, she insisted on taking a picture of us together (see attached). When I checked-out the next morning I was presented with a very professional greeting card with the picture included...which was very touching to say the least. So in summary, do yourself a favor and book your travel at this beautiful hotel with amazing staff...you will not regret it.","March 5, 2019","9    The Tokyo Station Hotel

Entry to the hotel can be made from multiple locations in the station which ensured we did not have to wander around trying to find the correct exit.

It's the people, the staff, the hotel management who graciously extend themselves in every way possible to ensure that each traveler enjoys a memorable visit to The Tokyo Station Hotel.Starting from the moment we entered the lovely lobby, there were no fewer than five staff people (bell persons, concierges, managers), offering assistance, expertly and efficiently checking us in, seeing to our luggage, etc. And that number and level of staff availability and assistance remained consistent throughout out stay: From the very tall, distinguished-looking bell-captain who navigated us through those l-o-o-n-g Palace-Side hallways to our 'Elegant and Refined European-Themed Superior King Room withBreathtaking View of Tokyo Financial District', to the attentive, petite young female bell-persons who could 'wrangle' heavy departure suitcases and parcels with equal aplomb.Our room was exactly what we had asked for: Quiet; Serene European decor; Highceilings; Tall windows; Soft lighting, including chandelier; Large bathroom with make-up lighted vanity, Toto multi-featured, heated-seat toilet, and spacious glass-walled walk-in shower.Sumptuous Daily Breakfasts in the sun-lit Atrium. Quiet Cocktails in the Lounge. Lunchavailable in the elegant British--style Lobby-Level Tea-Room. And always available to help, with a friendly smile, concierges and management persons such as Duty Manager, Yoshiki Kamata and, at the Front Desk, Ms Yuko Hosoi were very much appreciated.Thank You, one and all for making our stay at the one of a kind Tokyo Station Hoteltruly memorable!-BJLaB","February 4, 2019","9    The Tokyo Station Hotel

Actually, I’d like to spend my Christmas there, but unfortunately I just made myself clear by January instead. So we stayed for 2 nights on Jan 15 – 17, 2019 and choose Palace Side Superior Twin room as this is our last room type and suited our need best, we got room no. 3092 this time, and the view now, we got to see KITTE Mall and Post Office building next to the left side of our window. Detail things are pretty much the same as we got previously. All the cleanliness, beautiful room, amenities, comfy-ness, I can go on and on. But this time we got Handy in our room, the android phone like mobile device that you could carry around when you strolling the city. This is very helpful as the map is slightly better than google map, you can browsing for what’s trending or found any recommendation to dine or shopping or anything, make a local or international call, and the most important thing that you can save your phone battery for something else. There’s slightly rain when we arrived at the hotel, and one of the staff running out of the hotel toward us to help carry our heavy luggage and that’s not the end, as she (yes, you read it right) them, the other staff hand her a towel to dry out our luggage. We never ever have this kind of service experience before at any other hotel at the same situation. And more of this was when we’re checked out and very early in the morning, we ask one of the staff at reception desk for a taxi, and she was checking the taxi arrival for every couple of minutes to make sure it, while we just sat comfortably in the lobby instead of standing in a freezing cold morning.

522,"The people who work here make this hotel simply one of the best to stay in Tokyo. And talk about centrally located with train lines all over the city -- and country -- just steps away. I emailed 48 hours ahead of arrival requesting their NEX arrival service and was met immediately outside of our NEX car by a hotel attendant who helped us with luggage and a quick walk to the hotel. The rooms are on the small side like most hotels (we stayed Palace side on our first several days before taking off for Gora, and then a Dome side room for our last day) plus they have a sumptuous bathroom set up and I certainly took advantage of an evening bath every day in addition to a morning shower. If you don't know about Taq-u-Bin luggage transfer hotel to hotel, google and use it if you are traveling from hotel to hotel, city to city. Also, be sure to book with the breakfast included because, for us, it was a morning ritual and delightful way to start the day with selections of global goodies with great coffee and tea. In leaving to return to the airport, we were also taken by an attendant back to the NEX platform. Absolutely perfect.","January 2, 2019","9    The Tokyo Station Hotel

523,"To start, the staff member at check in was efficient and friendly, I was checked in within moments of arriving, and I was advised then of the 10am check out time. The lobby/reception area for check in is located one floor up from street level with access by stairs and a lift. Only two lifts however they are fast and your key card automatically selects the floor for you when you swipe it on the reader. Like most hotels rooms in Japan, the rooms are smaller than those you will find in say a North American or Australian hotel. However anyone returning to Japan will realise that this is standard and in all honesty the room is certainly more spacious than many I have stayed in. The room is well laid out and designed and with a little bit of Tetris like ingenuity I managed to find a way to keep both suitcases I was travelling with out of the way without compromising my movement within the room. The bed was located in the corner and certainly comfortable enough; next to the bed is a small bench that runs between the desk and bed. On this are power points and USB ports (along with a power point above the bed which has a ledge perfect for phones), and a fridge is located under this bench as well. The desk has more power points and plenty of space to work from if required, however be aware that the sink is located next to the desk. There is an open closet with nightwear provided and slippers (also provided are combs, toothbrush and paste etc). The shower is a Japanese style wet room with a bath. The bath is the usual short but deep Japanese bath and the shower has a removable shower head with great pressure and controls to select both pressure and temperature (individual for both shower and bath). For those who have never used a Japanese wet room, you will find a stool and a bowl provided (good for washing your hair and you use these items to wash prior to bathing) and the whole room is designed to get wet which makes it extremely spacious and not cramped. The toilet is the typical Japanese shower toilet however most of the controls are in Japanese except for the major functions. The toilet door also acts as the door between the entry door, corridor and shower/toilet area. Nearby there is a plethora of convenience stores including one attached to the hotel. The hotel store is a 7 Eleven, there is a Lawson Station across the road and a Family Mart just up on the street to the right. There are plenty of restaurants and shops in this area and the hotel is located only a few (Japanese sized) blocks down from the major shopping street of Ginza. The variety store Don Quixote is also found at the end of the street and features a massive range of various items, so if you forget to pack something they should have it there. To get to the hotel I used the Keisei Skyliner from Narita Airport which dropped me at Ueno Station, and then caught the Hibiya Subway Line to Higashi Ginza. From there it is a short walk using exit A1, down the street on the right hand side where the Mini Stop is. You can also use the Ginza Line from Ueno which places you at Ginza Subway Station (both Ginza and Higasi-Ginza are adjacent to each other). The other option is to take the JR N'EX service and alight at Tokyo Station, then catch the local Yamanote or Keihin-Tohoku service to Shimbashi and walk from there. Both take about the same amount of time to walk to the hotel from each station, maybe slightly longer from Shimbashi as there are a number of signalised crossings that you have to contend with.","July 12, 2019","10    Hotel Musse Ginza Meitetsu

524,"So delighted to choose this hotel because the room is spacious (compare to typical hotel rooms in Japan), clean and only few minutes walk to Ginza and stations. Also if you love to find street food, this hotel is only few minutes walk to the famous Tsukiji Market.Very convenient because we just need to go downstairs and can easily find convenience stores (7-eleven and Lawson). Staffs were also nice and very helpful. Hassle-free since we are allowed to keep our luggages while we’re away (we stayed there for first 2 days and off 2 nights to ski resort before coming back and stay for the rest of our trip).By the time of our visit the hotel is considered brand new and newly operated, so the price is quite reasonable.I would recommend this hotel for you because of the room size and its easy access ","June 17, 2019","10    Hotel Musse Ginza Meitetsu

527,"We stayed for 2 weeks as a base for exploring Tokyo, The hotel is well situated close to metro, Shimbashi JR and Tokyo station for going further afield. The surrounding area of Ginza is mostly luxury shops with lots of nice bakeries and restaurants for breakfast. There is a direct door to the 7-Eleven and lots of Family Marts etc in close range.We went for a larger double room which was considerably bigger than other Tokyo business hotels, with a small sofa. The room was clean and new-feeling with lots of the usual amenities - coffee/tea, kettle, safe, humidifier, hairdryer. You can also request an iron for free which stayed with us the whole time. The room felt slightly higher-end than what we paid, overall very pleased. Nb. the shower/bath is in a Japanese style, with the shower outside the bath. The reception was polite but fairly light-touch in terms of hospitality. A slight annoyance is that the lift always stops on the second floor for a few seconds of staring awkwardly at the reception staff before you can leave for the day.","June 7, 2019","10    Hotel Musse Ginza Meitetsu

Shower/bath and toilet are in different rooms! So rare for a budget hotel and the shower room is a wet room so good for older people who can’t step into a bath (my relatives).Check-in staff were friendly and efficient. The hotel is a short taxi ride to Tokyo station so super convenient and great if you want to explore Ginza.Didn’t get the room rate with breakfast but it looked nice.Would definitely stay again.","May 23, 2019","10    Hotel Musse Ginza Meitetsu

530,"Stayed at the biggest room of the floor facing the lift but with separate single beds. Asked to change to a double bed but in vain. Minus 1 rating.Appreciate that the bathroom & toilet are at the normal floor level in the room as with other hotels in other countries. Lots of charging ports for all your electronic devices plus a defuser that I only found out at the last day of checking out as I thought it is a vase.Noted that every hotel room in Japan comes with an air cleaner ( ceiling), thus making the room very clean. Of course, high tech toilet seats to warm & wash your bottom. The Japanese design always separate the toilet and the bathroom, probably of the locals obsess of avoiding the bad smell of using the toilet in both smell & sound. The high tech toilet can eliminate smell too.Water pressure in the traditional Japanese sit down bathroom is strong and there is a bath tub. I kinda of like bathing sitting down, like going to onsen.Adult Japanese video is available by buying the code from a TV machine next to the lift. Or else there are nothing to watch on the TV which is meant for the locals.A lot of Japanese text are in Chinese, thus I could read the Chinese texts & operate the devices & switches in the room.Washer & ice machine are at the 2nd floor, hotel check-in lobby. There is also an automated money exchange machine & restaurant at the same floor.There is a sign saying free storage of luggages for 1 day only at the check-in counter. ( but they used the word “cloak” that I do not understand )There is no swimming pool & gym in this hotel. There are a few Chinese restaurants near the hotel including one with a giant shark fin display which act as a land mark returning back to the hotel.At the ground floor, there is a direct 1-way access to the 7-11 store but have to come out from the cashier entrance when returning back to the hotel.Opposite this 7-11 is the larger Lawson, the local 24hrs convenient store.Overall it’s one of the biggest room that I have stayed in Japan.","May 7, 2019","10    Hotel Musse Ginza Meitetsu

Small room with poor soundproof and small bathroom, will be a challenge if you are travelling with more than 2 luggage, basically you can't open up more than 1 luggage in the room at the same time. Bathroom basin is in the bedroom itself, not ensuite in bathroom - I don't like such room layout. Bed was abit hard for my comfort. Housekeeping will make it a point to leave clean towels and mineral water outside the door for you daily even when you have the DND sign on, a very nice touch. 5-6mins walk from subway, 2-3 mins walk from Ginza - great location. There is a family mart beside & 7-11 within the hotel compound. F&B outlet doesn't allow guests to dine during breakfast in bedroom slippers, its a chore and hassle.

Our bags was delayed from our flight and the front desk received our late bags and held it for us. We loved the 7/11 down on the first floor which make everything so convenient. The subway wasn’t far either. We didn’t have breakfast there cause we walked over down the street to Tully (Japanese Starbucks). We love walking up and down Ginza.

539,"We stayed at this hotel for 5 nights in January 2019. This hotel had everything we could ask for! It was new, very clean, and modern. The room was very spacious for Japanese hotel standards - the shower room was big and did not feel cramped at all! We had enough space to put our 3 large luggages (+1 smaller carry on) pretty comfortably in the room. Amenities provided by the hotel was great, and the washer/dryer in the lobby was very convenient to do our laundry in (the hotel TV even has a tracker to tell you if it's already in use!). Note - the dryer takes forever to dry your clothes, it took us about 3 hours total to do laundry. We got free breakfast in the hotel every morning and the food was pretty decent, despite the limited choices. There was at least enough food to get you started for the day. There are lots of restaurants around the area should you choose not to eat at breakfast at the hotel. Getting to this hotel was very easy, we took a bus from Haneda airport to Tokyo station, then took a taxi to the hotel. The taxi ride took about 10 minutes and cost around 800 yen, not bad at all! To get to Narita airport when we left, we took the Airport Limosine Bus from the Ginza Courtyard Marriott, which was about a 3 minute walk down the street. Around the hotel there are a TON of shops and restaurants, Ginza is a wonderful area to stay in! There was a 24 hour Don Quijote and grocery store about 1 block away from the hotel. Also there are 7-11 and Lawson convenience stores right below the hotel. Additionally, there are also 3 train stations within a 10 minute walk from this hotel (Shimbashi Station, Ginza Station and Higashi Ginza station). Overall, I would definitely recommend staying here, it is very easy to get around Tokyo and this hotel provides all the comforts you could need while vacationing in Japan.

BTW, the thing i think the hotel might need to provide more is washing machine and lift. i would go back if last time our room not in front of the elevator. so i think i should explore other one.","October 4, 2018","10    Hotel Musse Ginza Meitetsu

551,"Its clean, its comfortable. The wifi is also good too. Toilet is clean and they have a bathtub. The staff is polite and helpful, even if they don't speak English. Because the hotel is directly above a 7-11 store, its pretty convenient for meals and snacks. it is also very near a lawson, family mart and donki store, that makes it easier to get buy souvenirs.","October 2, 2018","10    Hotel Musse Ginza Meitetsu

552,"This hotel is of great value, we paid about SGD352 a night for 2 pax.. it's right in the middle of Ginza, the room was spacious for 2 person with one medium sized luggage each, the toiletries provided (facial wash, towels, shampoo, conditioner, shower gel, etc) was of good quality. The cleaning crew was very meticulous and very friendly as well. Right below the hotel was a 7-eleven, across the street was Lawson and close by was a Don Quihote and a family mart... it's also about 10 minutes walk to Tsukiji market.. but if you're looking for a more central location (connected to the major MRT lines), Asakusa might be better... but we had a really good stay here, would highly recommend this hotel :)","September 13, 2018","10    Hotel Musse Ginza Meitetsu

553,"The hotel is located very near to Ginza or Shimbashi station along Ginza Line metro. Travelers can take a direct metro from Narita airport to any 1 of this station & walk about 600-800 m to reach the hotel. 1.) below the hotel is a 24 hrs 711 store. Where u can get anything there. 2.) I was greeted with extremely polite front desk staff, where they can speak very minimum English3.) the room......was compact. Built for the size of a Japanese. Comes along with a bath tub, with a chair & a scope for traditional Japanese shower if anyone could like to try. The toilet seat is located in the opposite. With a descent clothes hanging cabinet, with all the shoes shine accessories. There is also a low table to put ur luggage. 4.) the hand washing sink is located outside the toilet. With all toiletries provided. 5.) there is a safe & hair dryer located at the low table. With a mini fridge sit beside it. 6.) the walkway is about 1m wide, which make it very small to move around if there is 2 people.7.) the bed is located in between the 2 walls, like I said earlier, the room is really compact in this manner. But the bed is very comfortable with a small LCD tv mounted on the wall. 8.) as for the tv channels, they r all 100% in Japanese. Hahaha. Sorry for those non Japanese speaking tourists.9.) there r many nice restaurants around the hotel at a reasonable price. Well, it’s a very comfortable & descent hotel except for it small built room. Located Juz 100m away from the main Ginza shopping area. I would strongly recommend Hotel Musse to anyone who r looking a hotel in Ginza area. ","September 5, 2018","10    Hotel Musse Ginza Meitetsu

554,"I went to Tokyo July 2018 with my mom.I arrive at Higashi-Ginza Station and took A1 exit which is the closest exit to the hotel. From that point we only need to walk straight for 5-10 mins depend on how fast you walk. I also tried the route from Shimbanshi station but I think I took the wrong exit and walk a long way to the hotel with 2 luggage :(. So accessibility is depend on the exit you take.The location is the best. It's near the convenience store, don quijote, station, also you can go to Ginza station and to Ginza (ginza six, and other malls) by short walk through underground tunnel from higashi-ginza station. I went at summer so yeah, underground tunnel are so much better than scorching heat outside.The receptionists are all very helpful, some speak English well some don't. A suggestion, I think it's best to divide the reception for foreigner (for the one that speak English well) and local so it will be easier to communicate between the staffs and foreign guests, just like in some store in Japan that made 2 cashier one for foreigner (English speaker staff) and one for local.We stay in Standard Semi Double Non-Smoking room. The room is small but surprisingly comfortable. It is clean and well organized. Point plus I like the water pressure for the shower. There also 2 pajamas for use. The laundry facilities also one of my favorite. It is easy to use (price depends on how much your clothes are), suggestion please do check the capacity beforehand also if other guest is using the machine. I suggest do your laundry when you're planning to stay a long hour at the hotel or at night before you go to bed, bec it took 2 hours for me to finish the laundry.Overall I love my stay and will comeback here if going to Tokyo. Even though the hotel is small but I feel very comfortable, something rare I experience if staying at small room hotel.","September 2, 2018","10    Hotel Musse Ginza Meitetsu

556,"Hotel located a few blocks freom main Ginza area. Hidden 5 minutes away. The 2 Rooms that we booked are clean, but too small for 2 person with a 28” size suitecaseBe carefull of you shop and add another big suitcase, you gonna want to open it one at a time. We love the cleaning team, very meticuolous and friendly. Since this hotel is not in the Aiport Limousine bus stop (marriot hotel), you can go to and from the airport to this hotel using train. Go to the Kabukicho Theathre, at entrace no 3. You can find a direct train to the aiport. This will be easier and its a 1 train direct to airport, no need to change train. Kabukicho Theatre is a about 5-7 minutes walk. You can ask the front desk for the direction. We didnt know this route, until we asked the train station manager (even the hotel front desk doesnt know at that time). There are 3 train station nearby within 5-10 minutes walks.Other stations, you have to change 2-3 times until you reach the aiport. Other things that you can use is the washing machine. However, theres only 1 available and you have to take turns. I hope the hotel will add more machines in the near future. Below the hotel is a nice restaurant for dinner. We had a wonderful Italian meal, quality and taste worth the price. Below the restaurant is Seven Eleven shop, quite convenient to get things that you need. Overall, I would still recomend the hotel for business purpose or family with small children. For Family with teens, please book several rooms. We will definitely return to this hotel for the next visit.","August 18, 2018","10    Hotel Musse Ginza Meitetsu

The hotel staff were also friendly and always willing to cater to our requests. A special thanks for their effort in helping us to secure a booking at an omakase restaurant 1 day in advance. That meal made our trip to Tokyo even more memorable!

There’s a 7-11 on the ground floor which was perfect. For an overnight or short stay it was great and suited our needs.

I paid about $115 USD per night including breakfast. The room layout is more like a Japanese 1K than a hotel and the sink in the main room is a bit odd... That being said the full size ofuro and seperate toilet was nice. The interior sliding door to further block any noise was a nice little feature.

But the room has small but smart solutions for example the shower room and toilet is seperated and you can use the hall as a part of the bathroom making the bathroom feel bigger. The toilet door can be used to seperate the bedroom from the hall. Also the room is modern in wood with tablet and new technology toilet. One of the other good thing with this hotel is the area. Really central at Ginza with all the most exclusive brands like Prada, Tiffany & co, Valentino, Dior etc around. Also subway few minutes walking.

566,"We took a chance making a reservation at this hotel b/c it's brand new, and when we paid for our reservations no one had reviewed it yet -- so we were going in blind. We also got a fantastic price online because the hotel hadn't opened yet. WHAT A GREAT DECISION! This hotel is new, clean, modern, and our room was sheer perfection in terms of large size, comfortable queen bed, and nice furnishings (we even had a couch). The location was also very quick/easy to access from the airport (on the same side of Tokyo), and we had easy access to Tokyo Station (only one stop away on the JR line) when we were ready to depart to other parts of Japan. The hotel is also a close walk to Tsukiji Market, many great restaurants/shopping in Ginza, and the Shinbashi Train Station (about 10 mins), which is on the JR Yamanote line - a real cost saver if you have a JR rail pass!!!The check-in was very easy, they provided free umbrellas for the rain, and the hotel is also directly connected to a 7-11 if you want drinks or snacks in your room. So convenient! I can't recommend this hotel more. It's also very quiet. The street is a little ""dead"" at night, but you're just a 2-3 minute walk away from busier areas.This hotel offers very high value for the price paid.

568,"I stayed two nights at this hotel in different rooms. Overall, a good hotel with some interesting interior designs.Location: located within 5-8 mins walk to three metro stations (Ginza, Higashi Ginza and Shimbashi), 8 mins walk to the fish market and 3 mins to Donki 24 hour store and a local supermarket. You can get to the hotel (Higashi Ginza) directly from either Haneda or Narita Airport via Keisei Sky Access without interchange.Room: stayed in both semi-double (14 sqm) and standard hollywood twin (17sqm).Definitely go for standard double or twin because it is about jpy 1000 more expensive compared to semi double. The semi double room which i stayed in was on 3rd floor (reception on 2nd floor) was facing the wall of next building (the distance from the window is probably less than 1 meter), which offers no sunlight and was really depressing. I guess i was assigned this ""room"" because my booking via agoda was at deep discount. It appears that most single and semi double rooms (up to 6th or 7th floor) have the view of building wall, whereas standard rooms are facing the inner street with minimum traffic.I guess most rooms (except for those on the top floor) have separate toilet room, bathroom and wash basin. Some pros and cons for this type of design. However the door which shares between toilet room and the bedroom for semi double room or the sliding door can provide some privacy if two persons are staying together.There is free bottled water (evian) provided. No cotton pad was provided during my stay (they probably think that male guests do not need cotton pad...)Most importantly, very comfy bed and quiet aircon.Services: some staff speaks English well. The hotel also helps me to keep my luggage a few days prior to check in so that i had less belongings while travelling in countryside. But they did not offer me early check in even i was staying in the hotels for 2 consecutive nights (different rooms though) even there was room available.Would recommend!","April 24, 2018","10    Hotel Musse Ginza Meitetsu

It was really nice and the space in your own bed is huge. Downside of this is that you really hear a lot of noise if the person on the top moves a lot but is not really that bad. The door to the makeup room closes airtight so even if a hair dryer is being used inside your will not hear a thing outside. Showers are traditional style where you sit down and take a shower like that and they also have one standing shower in each floor shower room or a private shower on the 1st level.If you are staying here i really recommend you to order the Bfast with them as it´s cheap and while it might not have 100 choices, it´s a really great way to save some money on bfast and spend it on lunch outside or at attractions ;)","May 15, 2018","11    Ryokan&Hostel Wasabi Nippori

580,"Stayed here for 4 nights and it was a very pleasant stay. The guesthouse is located right next to the train station (Mikawashima), and offers a convenient route via Narita to Narita airport. The guesthouse itself is also super clean and pleasant. The capsules are spacious (some have windows) and the rooms are clean. Only downside is that there isn’t a real luggage storage area, so you kinda just find some free space at the back of the room to put your luggage. The public bath is cool, you get to have a warm ‘onsen’ bath every day after a long cold day. Otherwise, there is also a private shower on the first floor. There is a common area at the reception/lounge where you can chill, have a drink or eat. There is also a fridge if you have foodstuff needing to be kept or refrigerated.Overall, only good things to say about this place. Highly recommended if you are solo, on a budget and looking for a comfortable place to stay. ","February 9, 2018","11    Ryokan&Hostel Wasabi Nippori

The futons are very comfortable but when they are rolled out there isn't much space in the room. The best part of this hostel is the public bath in the ladies' dorm which is clean and relaxing, a great way to wind down the day. Will definitely stay again.

585,"it is a long overdue review but I don't expect anything to have changed.I booked a private room for three nights end of December 2015. As mentioned by other reviewers most of the staff was less than welcoming. Actually quite rude by Japanese standards (and even European ones). The first room we were given was facing the station which happen to be extremely busy even very late at night with a train every 2 or 3 minutes. The private rooms are on top of the small building and those facing the train station are incredibly loud. The room was tiny even supposed to be for 3 people (Japanese style, futons). No space for luggage pretty much with a tiny old bathroom that cannot even compare to the tiny but sophisticated bathrooms you find in regular hotels. Even 2 stars ones.We ended up getting a room on the side, hence not directly facing the station but suffering from the same lack of noise insulation and decent space. I cancelled the reservation for the other two nights but the hostel insisting on us paying 50% of the 2 days we would not be in. Not nice and probably not to the letter of the cancellation policy In any case not customer friendly and definitely not Japanese at all except for the name...In summary the worst stay at a hotel (hostel in this case) ever. Far away from any Japanese standard which by the way I find absolutely amazing and above anything I have seen elsewhere on this little planet. I cannot speak of the shared space and the real hostel experience with dorms etc... but I can only strongly advise anyone tempted to book a private room to look elsewhere. At ￥12,600 a night it was a very expensive (for what we got) and unpleasant experience. We ended up booking two rooms in a real hotel in the center of Tokyo for less that the price of the incredibly low quality room that we were offered at the Wasabi Nippori hostel. No kidding. In a standard hotel chain (APA). There we enjoyed the real usual fantastic Japanese hospitality (and yes very very limited English but adorable). So clearly if you are a family and want to enjoy Tokyo and real Japanese hospitality as well as a quiet and comfortable stay avoid Wasabi Nippori at all cost.","August 27, 2017","11    Ryokan&Hostel Wasabi Nippori

586,"So, my friend and i went to Japan for 13 days and the last 3 days we spent it in Tokyo. We chose this hostel randomly, but, i really love this place. I stayed in a different places before, and this is the best. The staffs were very kind and very helpful, and they speak english really good. I was really happy to stay there, even in a mix dorm. It's all good. The dorm, the public bath, the private shower, and the lounge, all are very clean. And the JR Station is in front of your eyes, just take a walk for 2-3 minutes.

588,"I stayed here alone for a couple nights while visiting Tokyo before heading North to ski and it was an absolutely lovely place to stay. Quiet safe neighbourhood with very cute alleyways that I was really happy to be able to wander around - a Japanese supermarket/shop as well as a 7/11 just around the corner and the Mikawashima station couldn't have been closer as you can see from my photo from the train platform.I stayed in the female dorm and loved the room. The little curtain gives more privacy than other hostels I've ended up in on my travels and although the capsule type beds might seem small there was plenty of space in there for me and all my luggage. 3 bathrooms in the room/on the floor as well as a female public bath which was nice and always very quiet for those who might be shy about getting naked in front of strangers - I think this would be a nice intro for travellers. There is also a private shower downstairs if you prefer.Staff were always super friendly and happy to help.The reason I chose and loved this place was because it was so convenient to the train station as well as being in a quiet area rather than in the middle of the neon signs and everything you might immediately associate with Tokyo. I did have issues getting back a night or two when I headed to Shibuya to party with some friends as public transport ends fairly early and taxis are expensive - but that's not the fault of the hostel, more my bad planning! And as I said, I did appreciate the fact it was a little further out rather with very good transport links rather than being only in the centre.Would recommend to anyone!","May 24, 2017","11    Ryokan&Hostel Wasabi Nippori

589,"Rooms are decent, capsule / bed is big enough and comfortable. Temperature is good. Staff is not the nicest people I have met, but they do their job. English level of some staff is really low or inexistent. Japanese bathroom with hot tub is great, but only available from 21.15 to 23.00. Only one shower available 24 hours. There many hours where staff is not there. I had an emergency with the door locked at my room, and there was no one to help. So I almost slept on the floor because I was not able to get in my room. I rang the bell several times, nobody came to help. The hotel is very very clean. The provide all toiletries and security box. Common room is very poor and uncomfortable. It is not very central but transportation for JR users is very close. Be ready for 30/40 minutes trips to go out to the central places. If you want to go out a weekend night, there is not subway or train the hostel after 12.00 am until 4.30 am, only option is taxi.

If you pay for the ""breakfast"" the day before, you will be charge 300 instead of 500. Yes and the morning after if you want coffee you need to pay 100 more. So what's the point. I recommend you to do not pay for breakfast but go to the 7 -11 next door (cheaper and better) it was too far out as well. The main train station, nippori , was 20 mins walking.

593,"Spent 7 nights at this property. LOCATION:Situated a corner away from Mikawashima Station, it’s just one stop from Nippori on the Yamanote Line, which is all the typical tourist will need to get to almost all of Tokyo’s sights. This makes it very accessible not only from Narita or Haneda Airport (via Keisei Line or Shinagawa/ Hamamatsucho for the latter) but also for travel to/from Northern Honshu due to the proximity of Ueno Station.The neighbourhood (Arakawa) around the hostel is a working class district that lacks the “bling” of more posh areas like Shinjuku, but is quiet and safe, and allows more reasonable rates due to the lower property values. There are plenty of places to eat and buy supplies (a pharmacy and convenience store are close by) and because of the hostel, store clerks are more or less used to dealing with tourists who don’t speak the language. CLEANLINESS/FACILITIES:A stickler for cleanliness, I could not find much fault in this place at all. Any mess made by guests would be cleaned in a reasonable time. As for facilities, locals say that this establishment used to be a public bath (sento). Ergo, there are 2 segregated baths- men in the basement, and the women on the 2nd floor. Those uncomfortable with these arrangements can use the private shower at the ground floor, which always seemed unoccupied every time I was there. The green shower gel supplied at the baths smells awful though, so you might want to bring your own, but I used it every time for a whole week and it worked fine.SECURITY:Access to the dorm areas are protected by a code lock. However, this is the type of hostel where luggage is kept at an open rack in each dorm. Only 13in x 16in x 22in (like small 300 yen coin lockers) and mailbox size security lockers are available near the reception for a Y500 deposit, so this might be a problem if you need to secure a lot of high value items or do a lot of shopping. The fire exit at the basement dorm is also a potential security risk. There (may) be a possibility someone gaining access and walking off with luggage unnoticed (not sure if there’s a camera monitoring the area). Same thing goes for shoes which left at shelves near the entrance. Not surprisingly, disposable slippers kept on fish “hooks” at my sleeping pod (free, from a business hotel previously stayed in) disappeared on the third day, but I didn’t bother to report it, due to the negligible value. As with all shared accommodations though, it’s important to always be vigilant with your own belongings, and signs posted by management constantly remind guests to do so. CONCLUSION:Definitely a pleasure to stay at, with friendly, multilingual staff who ran the place like family. They might even show you around town, or share a beer with you (if they’re free). Hostels are supposed to be sociable accommodations, but this place is a cut above the rest. The whole experience was more like staying at a friend’s house rather than as a paying guest.No qualms about staying here again; I even booked their sister property for my next trip.===Note: This report's intentionally written 3 months after the fact to maintain an impartial/fair review.","February 1, 2017","11    Ryokan&Hostel Wasabi Nippori

609,"Firstly, I was travelling on my own and had no idea what to expect when I got here. I was welcomed by staff who were fluent in English (Some can't really speak English, but this is Japan). It's a guest house with clean capsules (Private rooms for those who wish for more privacy and also a female-only dormitory) and meticulous staff who clean them every time a guest checks out. The large public bath/hot bath are downstairs and is a great way to wash your woes and relax. There's also a private bath for those on the main floor for those who need that little bit of privacy. Right after a bath, you can sit in the lounge and get to know the staff like I did (They're really friendly. Just strike up a conversation and before you know it, you'll be talking the night away). A lot of the other guests relax in the lounge as well and tend to be friendly - friendly enough to talk to other guests. It's an experience that doesn't occur often, but it does here.

610,"Stayed there three nights. Staff is friendly and the hostel is very clean. Had a bed in the female dormitory. They have ""japanese style"" mattress, so it is a little hard if you are not used to it, but hey! it is part of the experience ;) but you can ask for a mattress for free to put under the matt, it helps. So many nice details (free coffee and tea the whole day, free cosmetics, clothes iron, hair dryer, adaptor free of charge to borrow, etc) was pretty cool.Thanks Wasabi staff for a great stay! :)","June 8, 2016","11    Ryokan&Hostel Wasabi Nippori

Complimentary coffee, teas & miso soup were the value added features at this pleasant hostel. Very convenient to near by action packed areas of Tokyo plus the quiet / real Japanese lifestyle surrounding this hostel are the valuable benefits. I'll come back to stay there again before leaving Japan on this 2016 trip and also in the future.","June 2, 2016","11    Ryokan&Hostel Wasabi Nippori

612,"This hostel is a real cool one to stay at. At first, I was kinda intrigued, because of the location, but when I arrived it was good to see the JR Mikawashima station as a 5-minute walk away. Well, the staff was really nice and lovely, especially good was when they went out with us for karaoke. They had everything there and the interior looked really great and cosy, it was even ok that there was only one real private shower and I showered every day for the 7 days I was there. And they have free, unlimited miso-soup, tea, coffee!! Totally recommend the hostel, its one of the best for this cheap price.","May 12, 2016","11    Ryokan&Hostel Wasabi Nippori

613,"Location is really good, juts 2 minutes from MIkawashima station on JR line. Very close to Ueno for Ueno Park, Ueno Zoo or shopping at Ameyoko, as well as Nippori for textile shopping. These two are also main interchange railway stations either for Tokyo or Narita, Due to proximity to the train station, some noises from rail are expected. It didn't bother us but may bother others who are sensitive to noise or lightsleeper.We stayed for one day in a western style double private bedroom with ensuite. The room is good size, considering its in Japan, clean and has all basic amenities. In our opinion, our experience may be better if there are more hook or place to hang our clothes, wet towel etc. Another thing is, the carpet could be deodorized since sometimes it smells of rotten socks. The check in and check out process were good and efficient. Free green tea and miso soup are available in their kitchen, as well as being allowed to use their kitchen amenities such as microwaves etc. We didn't try other facilities such as spa etc.We had good and relaxing time, and recommend this place if you are looking for not too expensive place close to a JR station.","April 22, 2016","11    Ryokan&Hostel Wasabi Nippori

615,"The staff was always kind and friendly. The facilities themselves were clean and fully functional. Sleeping quarters in the mixed dormitories were large enough to kneel and freely move around without feeling too cramped. Depending on the other guests the noise level was pretty low with the powder room door being soundproof (I was assigned the capsule right next to it). In the mix dorm there is a small space outside of the capsules in a shared area where you can stow luggage, that being said the capsules themselves have no trouble accommodating an average sized person + luggage if you feel insecure. In the common area on the ground floor there was a miso soup dispenser that my friends and I made us of to warm ourselves up in the mornings, and if you weren't feeling particularly savory then there was also a hot/cold tea/coffee/water dispenser directly next to it along with a micro wave. There are towels provided for a fee of 200yen if you do not wish to bring your own. If you don't think a shared bath house is something you'd enjoy then there is a private shower stall you can use, but it is rather modest in size. Free wifi on every floor that I had no trouble connecting to and was pretty stable for streaming purposes (didn't try any gaming). There is a 711 literally around the corner as well as being located <1minutes walk from Mikawashiwa station.

I will never forget it.Now, they are starting to have parties, so, I can still visit every 2 weeks (I have my own apartment now).Anyway, it is really cheap (for Japan I mean), clean, staff are great etc. They are really friendly, so, you can meet them, hang out with them etc.Capsules etc are really nice (it is a pretty new hostel, it was a hotel, and got new owners and became a hostel, 2 years ago). They have normal couple rooms upstairs too.Location is good. 1 minute from Mikawashima station. Mikawashima station is like 2 minutes from Nippori. Nippori also has the best restaurant in Japan (Zakuro).This hostel has Japanese style stuff, and western style stuff. Lot`s of Japanese stuff for sale or just to play with for free.They got computers too, and some kind of drink machine with free soup and tea etc. Oh, and they have a huge TV.","February 7, 2016","11    Ryokan&Hostel Wasabi Nippori

628,"The location is not the most ideal. It is very far away from the main tourist spots like Shinjuku and shinbuya - about 45 mins using the efficient subway. It’s about 350 meters to the kuramae and Asakusa stations. The Ginza line Asakusa station is about 850 meters away. There are not many eateries within the vicinity. A convenient store is located only a few hundred meters away. It is however quite convenient to get to Narita Airport from the hotel (Asakusa Line : use exit A2b if you have luggage, otherwise use exit A3a) pl note that this train WILL not run if there is snow! I was unfortunate that the train did not run when I needed it. So I had to use the Skyliner to Ueno station and walked a few hundred meters to transfer to the Ginza line. From the Asakusa Station, it’s another 850 m to the hotel. The room is quite clean but the cleaning lady always left dirty cleaning cloth in my room. It happened on 2 days out of 8. I have stayed in very small rooms before in Tokyo but Hotel Hokke Club takes the cake. You can’t swing a cat in the room. I had no interaction with the staff except during checkin and checkout. The staff very quite friendly except for one bespectacled male staff who was on duty on 10 Feb at about 6.15 am - he was very rude. His rude behavior was downright obtrusive. I think that at this price point, there are definitely better options in Tokyo. After my 8 nights stay, I was bemused by the positive TA reviews. I’d have rated this hotel much higher if it was my 1st time in Tokyo but having stayed in several other hotels before, Hotel Hokke Club does offer a good price to value ratio.

My room was smallish, but I've had smaller even in France. Here there was a queen bed, good size bathroom, and space at the foot of my bed to open my very large suitcase. The breakfast is incredible, both for the quality and the variety - in two weeks I never ate exactly the same thing twice. Finally the ease of access by direct train from Narita aorport with lifts/elevators from track to street. After that, the hotel is less than five minutes from two stations, Asakusa and Kuramae so anywhere in the city is never more than half an hour away.

I like that it was a tiny bit away from the tourist locations as it was quieter, but some people might be uncomfortable coming back super late at night.I don’t think that the breakfast is worth the cost.

The coin operated washing machines and dryers were much appreciated, although I had to run the dryer quite a few times to get everything dry. While this hotel is not in the trendiest area of Tokyo, it is close to several major tourist attractions, such as Senso-ji Temple and the Sky Tree. The area seems to consist primarily of office buildings without much of a nightlife, however, the area just west of Senso-ji Temple was bit more lively, and only about a 10 to 15 minutes walk away. There were several 24 hour restaurants and 24 hour Don Quijote that came in very handy for some last minute midnight shopping. It was also nice to walk along the Sumida river which was just a couple of blocks away. I also appreciated that it was very easy to catch the train to Nikko from Asakusa station, which is a short walk away from the hotel. Additionally, Shibuya and Shinjuku, were still easily accessible via metro in about 35 minutes.Getting to and from this hotel from Haneda Airport was also very straightforward as you’re able to ride the Keikyu-Kuko Line, which turns into the Asakusa Line, all the way to the hotel without any transfers.

643,"Booked through Expedia good deal for single room & breakfast. Chose location as good access to Narita airport from nearby Asakusa subway on Keisei express.Location is a business area about 10 mins walk from touristy area near Senso-ji temple and Sumida river. Also close to Toei Asakusa mainline station and 2 subway lines so easy to get around.Hotel is so clean and quiet and usual Japanese efficiency.Small single room but immaculate and comfy bed with good bathroom. Very good wifi in room. TV only had local channels and CNN in Japanese only.Best part of staying here was the incredible Japanese buffet breakfast, easily the best I had in 3 weeks of travelling around Honshu island. So much variety and delicious.Also whole hotel is non-smoking which is excellent.Plus free toiletries for women to restock if you like.","June 23, 2017","12    Hotel Hokke Club Asakusa

648,"Hotel Hokke Club Asakusa is a fantastic place to stay in this part of Japan.Located only about 7 minutes easy walk from the famous Sensoji Temple and large markets, and restaurants, this modern (April 2017) Hotel has very friendly and helpful staff and really can't be faulted, except for the fact that the rooms are small. This is typical in Japan, but ideal for a short stay. Trains are nearby and will take you anywhere you want to go. Downtown Tokyo, Shinjuku, Akihabara are all just a short train trip away, even the train station to Narita Airport is only about 200m from the hotel.The journey to Narita takes about 50mins at a cost of about $15 to $17 Australian. The train to the airport runs about every 50mins.NB. The room we chose was very small, but I believe they do have larger rooms at an extra cost also.","May 4, 2017","12    Hotel Hokke Club Asakusa

They even gave me an ice pack after I sprained my foot walking around Tsukiji. Another time, after I set out to start my day, they chased me down the street with an umbrella because they saw that I didn't have one! Very sweet people! Also, a 5-10 minute walk to two train stations, Senso-Ji Temple, and Nakamise shopping street. Asakusa is nice and quiet at night, which I liked. I would stay there again in a heartbeat (and I probably will if it's available the next time I book a trip to Tokyo).

You may leave baggage without extra cost. Very near the Asakusa Station with direct access to and from the Narita Airport. 7-11 and Family Mart are just a 5-min walk. Tip: From the Asakusa Station, use exit A2, there's an elevator there so you wont need to carry heavy luggage going up and down the stairs at exit A1. You just have to cross the street to get to the side of the Hotel.

666,"Myself and two friends stayed in the Hokke Club Asakusa from the 2nd-6th April 2016. I established through some research that Hokke Club seems to be a national Japanese chain, and based on the price we paid I assumed the chain was a Japanese equivalent to Premier Inn or Ibis, so I was expecting something basic, but I was pleasantly surprised by the features of the hotel.Arrived late in the evening after 18 hours of flights and train hopping from Narita to Asakusa. Got lost at first but once you get your bearings you will find the hotel is ideally situated to reach Asakusa metro station (to the north) or Kuramae metro station (to the South). The complimentary wifi in the hotel is fast and easy to connect to.Staff were courteous and spoke very good English and check-in was quick and efficient. My friends and I were scattered over different floors, so I can only comment on my room which was in on the 8th floor. The rooms are compact, though I have heard this is the norm in Tokyo. In my case the bathroom was immediately to my left on entering the room and the single bed was just beyond the bathroom on the left, slotted neatly between the back wall of the bathroom and the window. In the ""corridor"" leading to the bed there was a rail with some hangers for clothes (no space for wardrobes!) as well as some traditional sandals slotted into a rest near the floor. You also have a traditional robe provided.On the right wall of the sleeping area was a small but functional wall mounted TV and below it a decent sized desk with a built in multi-functional charger (better equipped than most economy hotels in the UK/Europe!).The bathroom was also compact but functional. The toilets come with the infamous ""control panels"" which if you're unfamilar with, I will leave you to discover yourself! The bathroom provides a wide variety of complimentary toiletries including large dispenser bottles of shampoo, hand wash and shower gel and a hair dryer is also provided. The one thing I can't comment on is the food as my friends and I tended to eat out every day. There is a 7/11 store 5 minutes walk away which is ideal for grabbing a quick snack in the morning. And there is a variety of good restaurants in and around Senso-ji temple about 10 minutes walk North.

It was a good hotel then if only for it's location and comfortable beds.Now, however, the hotel belongs to the Hokke Group and it is an absolutely great hotel for the above reasons and the fact that it feels like a much more expensive hotel than it is. The refurbishment is amazing! The decor is modern and very clean.The rooms are small, as to be expected for a Japanese business hotel, but they are spotlessly clean have everything you could possibly need. There's nothing better than getting back to the hotel after a long day of sight-seeing and having a long soak in the deep bath.Staff are friendly, speak a good level of English and will do whatever they can to help you.I can't rate this hotel highly enough! I have stayed in 6 different hotels during various trips to Japan and this is by far the best one.The great thing about this hotel is that, if you fly into Haneda Airport, the hotel is accessible via the Asakusa Line.

Clean, quiet and brand new. Fully working wifi in room and restaurant.An excellet solution for live in Tokyo.","January 7, 2016","12    Hotel Hokke Club Asakusa

676,"Had a five night stay in late December here. Everything is a-ok at this hotel. Staff is attentive and friendly and there is always someone on hand who speaks good enough English for those in need. Booked the biggest room, the twin, and it was perfect for 3 guests. We never felt cramped and the layout of the room, while different, was sufficient. The breakfast is wonderful here, highly recommend it. Vast choices of both local as well as western cuisine. The staff was more than accommodating when we asked to leave our bags at the front desk area when we checked out on our last day as our flight was not until later that night (we were wondering where they out all that stuff as we were not the only one's doing so!). In sum, I'd give this place 6 stars if I could! Asakusa is a terrific area. The location of the hotel is in a quiet part of town with the main area of shopping and the temple being a 6-8 minute walk down the street. There is a 7-11 and Family Mart close by to purchase water and other goodies (tip: 7-11 has a spectacular selection of food to-go and they will even warm it up for you - this ain't your local 7-11 with old hot dogs turning on that warming machine) and an ATM that will work with a US ATM card (Plus symbol).","January 6, 2016","12    Hotel Hokke Club Asakusa

So the size of the room shouldn’t be a reason for a bad review. The rooms are clean and service is good. For me, beds were a little hard, which is not what we experienced in Kyoto. The location is excellent for access to the train station, restaurants are open late and it s close to subways. For what we paid, totally worth it. Not a 5 star hotel, but not a Motel 6 either.

680,"VERY SMALL BEDS AND ROOMS, FAMILIES TAKE A NOTEWe had booked Double Room for 2 adults and a 11 y. child for one week via Ebookers that said the room could be occupied up to 3 persons. When we arrived we just laughed and thought there has been a mistake, room had 140cm wide bed with no extra bed. Room was so small that an extra bed would have not even fit in the space that was left. And after the normal amount of luggage, all the floor space was taken. Website states that the room is about 16m2 but the bedroom itself was about 4-5m2 as large part of the space was consumed by relatively large bathroom and a long corridor. When we stated the issue at the reception, they informed that HOTEL DOES NOT HAVE EXTRA BEDS at all. Even us 2 adults had trouble sharing the 140cm bed together, let alone with an extra child. We asked why they make reservations for 3 persons when the room has no space to commodate 3rd person, we were told very blatantly that this is a business hotel, not a family hotel. There was not even extra towels etc for a third person. We asked to be moved to a larger room, that could be done for extra price that we then of course had no change but to pay. The bed was 160cm wide but still no extra bed/ convertible sofa etc. as hotel has none. WE HAD TO GO AND BUY A MATTRESS OURSELF and one of us slept on the floor. This should not be something that happens in 4 star hotel. We also had to go and ask for third set of sheets for the mattress EVERY DAY seperately after cleaning. I don’t know if it’s a cultural thing but I was quite taken back by the fact that when trying to solve this matter, there was no trace of empathy or apologies by staff dealing in this matter. In fact, I felt like our problem was a nuisance and not theirs to solve. We were told that we were not promised an extra bed, this is a business hotel, that we should go and solve this matter through our travel agency. We did not ask for refund or discount, nor a free upgrade. We just wanted a room fit for 3 people to sleep and stay. We were of course disappointed and unhappy with the situation, but not at any point rude or inappropriate towards the staff. I would like to add that we had friendly help with the case of lost luggage at the airport from the hotel staff. I felt service was generally happy and helpful in regular matters.Our new room was located in 20th floor. Still you could hear trains, ambulance sirens and traffic suprisingly well to the room through the night.Location is superb, everything is just outside of the hotel, and Shinjuku station is within a short walking distance. Breakfast was very good and well organised even at rush hours.","July 3, 2019","13    Hotel Gracery Shinjuku

682,"I'm not much of a complainer, but this experience was not great. We arrived an hour before check in and were looking to shower after an overnight flight and were told to come back later to check in. The building is literally a skyscraper there are really no additional rooms ready? ok, whatever..returned later and asked if they could call ahead to a restaurant in Osaka that speaks no english and make a reservation for us, as we were headed to Osaka next, but the consierge gave us some crap about them not being able to make a reservation on our behalf..hmm..isnt that the job of the consierge? just do it man. called our Osaka hotel and they did it for us no problem.The rooms were the smallest rooms ive ever stayed at in my life, and i frequently go on cruises. I thought oh maybe this is just how japanese rooms are, but the next 4 places we stayed at were all substantially bigger.Lastly, our room was located right next to the godzilla so if we tried to take a daytime nap (with our jet lag) we would be awoken on the hour to hear the fake godzilla let out its roars.Great location in shinjuku but man they could polish a lot of stuff up. i'd stay at a less touristy hotel and something with better service in Shinjuku if i could do it all over again..","July 1, 2019","13    Hotel Gracery Shinjuku

We found it quite funny to see Godzilla on the hotel terrace when we arrived! The lobby is welcoming, and the room is comfy and very clean.

You would have difficulty to choose a restaurant as there’s just hundreds within your proximity! The hotel was hugh so you could expect heavy traffic at the lobby on the 8th floor, but they are very efficient so check-in check-out are very smooth. But you can feel the hotel staff always seems to be in a hurry, and answer your questions sometimes without really listen to what you ask!

Loved the friendly staff. They were very helpful to us esp with tips and guides. The room was neat and tidy. We had ordered a baby cot and noticed it wasn't there. On enquiring was told that it was landed to someone and we'll get it the next day. We didn't make any fuss and said all good and went back to our room, then nek minute they sourced a baby cot for us and were very apologetic. They approach kids and babies is very different. Also smiling and talking to kids and telling the kids stories about the Godzilla. The housekeeping were just AMAZING!!! We also came back to a very neat and tidy room.

693,"We stayed in Hotel Gracery for 8 nights, on the top floor (30th storey) in a double room with 2 big sized beds. The 2 beds were bigger than a super single, but smaller than a queen. But they were just great for my family of 2 adults and 2 kids, and the room is spacious compared to a typical Tokyo hotel room. Love the bathroom which comes with a bathtub, and serves as a full wet room. Separate toilet room, and wash basin is outside the bathroom.Inner partition seperator for the bed/tv area vs the bathroom/ toilet area.Location of the hotel is fantastic. Minutes walk from JR Yamanote line and Metro, and there are underground linkway with shopping and restaurants. There were 2 convenience stores downstairs (7-11 and Lawson station). Lots of restaurants that open way into the night, and the area feels very safe even at midnight. Oh and of course the huge Godzilla head that makes navigating back to the hotel from the street super easy. Just look up and search for the godzilla head. Great breakfast options - 2 choices everyday, either at the lobby lounge on 8th floor for sandwich buffet, or at level 1 for the full buffet option.

694,"Good things - clean, safe, lots of restaurants around for food options, very centrally located. Staff spoke English reasonably. Things that made it not a 5 star review - rigidity, and bathrooms. Rigidity because it led to not keeping a guests needs in focus. Example, running late to an event, had a small bag (size of a notepad from shopping, check in and concierge/bell desk is on 8th floor, however they do have a desk on the ground floor where entrance is. Asked staff if they could either keep it there until I returned or have it sent up to room. Answer was a resounding “no, we do not have this service”. Asked another way (as I thought maybe language was a barrier and she misunderstood), no “we cannot do that, you will have to ask at 8th floor”. Then went to 8th floor and asked 1 of the 3 bell staff standing around and they were very Accommodating. Would it have been so hard to fulfill a customers request? This was one of a few instances. The concierges were a little inept, u able to give guidance to restaurants or attractions (saw this with myself and others while I was waiting in line to speak to them.). They are helpful to execute booking something if you know what you want. Secondly, I was sharing a room with my teenage son. Being a woman, and his mother, obvious privacy issues with showers etc. Delays twin room was spacious for a room In Tokyo, however, unless I wanted to get dressed in the wet shower room (you will come to understand this if you stay in Japan), where there aren’t even hooks to hang a towel, I was forced to come out into the larger room (full view) wrapped in a towel to try to get dressed in front of my son. (Don’t even really care about the optics, just physically uncomfortable trying to not drop the towel while putting gitch on). Can’t imagine if I was on a work trip with colleagues or friends and sharing a room. Oh, and no private space, business center. Only lobby where if you need to have a private conversation you will be sharing it with everyone else around you.

706,"We really enjoyed our stay at Hotel Gracery. The service from check-in tp check-out was excellent, from the front desk staff to the concierge. They were always willing to assist. Our room was on the 26th floor with an amazing view of Tokyo. We had a deluxe twin room which had plenty of space for our family. For those of you wondering if ""twin"" means North American ""twin"", the answer is ""not quite"". We found Japanese twin beds to be a bit bigger so that they can accommodate families better. The separate bathroom with soaker tub was also a nice feature!There are a number of restaurants at the base of the hotel, including an excellent Italian restaurant. Show your hotel key and you get access to a special pricing menu. The food was very good and we went a couple of times. There are too many other restaurants to count in the surrounding area, everything from traditional Japanese food to a McDonalds.One of the best features of the hotel is the location. it is a 6 min walk from the train station that gets you all around Tokyo. There is a nice Samurai Museum right behind the hotel. The area has a very active night life and while it is considered by some to be a ""red light"" district, we didn't find it to be seedy. There are plenty of locals and tourists around, no one bugs you (especially if you are with your significant other or as a family) and it felt VERY safe. I would definitely stay here again. And yes, kids love the Godzilla at the top of the hotel!","April 27, 2019","13    Hotel Gracery Shinjuku

707,"Recently traveled to Tokyo with friends, and we decided to stay at the Hotel Gracery in Shinjuku. My room on the Ladies Floor was small but comfortable and perfect in every way! The bed was spacious and the room layout was functional. I was glad that there was a pillow menu and I asked for 2 extra soft pillows, which were eagerly provided.Being on the ladies floor meant that we had a steady supply of mini presents like facial & hair products and a foot massager, among other amenities. I enjoyed the bathroom! There was a separate room for the tub and shower area. Customer service was great! Staff were so polite and tried to address all concerns, no matter how minor. There was a vendo machine for drinks and an ice dispenser on the floor, which was convenient. A very nice touch was providing a smartphone with wifi in each room, which we could use when we ventured out.We enjoyed meeting up at the hotel lobby, with a balcony where we saw Godzilla every day. When we venture onto the streets, Hotel Gracery is right in the middle of Shinjuku, very near Ichiran Ramen, Coco Curry, and Don Quixote, among others. It is also a comfortable walk away from the JR Station. Can't wait to be back!! Thank you, Hotel Gracery!","April 27, 2019","13    Hotel Gracery Shinjuku

711,"We stayed for 4 nights , the hotel is located in the middle of all the mayhem of Shinjuku , however it remains aloof of it and is actually very classy inside . We stayed in one of the superior comfort rooms (2501)The room size was very reasonable considering this is Japan. The view out of the windows is interesting to say the least and makes a good photograph on its ownNoise insulation I found to be absolutely excellent from outside your room and from the floor above , we heard nothing. There is low level street noise which is to be expected in this area but trust me of very low level and no concern .The only weakness to the whole package was the bed which were on the firmer side, the pillows were also firm and the quilt was not sumptuous. Had it not been for this I would've given the hotel 5 Stars.The hotel service is absolutely excellent, the massive reception area has an air of class. The concierge service is very helpful. There is an in house laundry room which is well stocked out with modern machines , it's an excellent idea and we used this facility and I strongly recommend you do the same, you enter a PIN number on machine so no one can take your clothes in your absence .You will always be able to get a taxi from the hotel , we did on several occasions, make sure you have a hotel card to show a driver for your return journey as the taxi people do not speak good English .You are a walking distance with your luggage from Shinjuku station (10minutes approx) , make sure you exit from the central East at stationShinjuku (the area) is like staying in a cross between Soho / Piccadilly Circus in London, or Times Square New York . However unlike either of those it's completely safe to walk the streets at any time of day or night. Would I stay again, I wouldn't even look elsewhere, this is a truly excellent hotel with just the one weakness which I hope they rectify ","April 18, 2019","13    Hotel Gracery Shinjuku

The services offered were stellar. They give you a handy phone to use during your stay. They let us borrow umbrellas and let us store our bags for a few hours after checkout. The coin laundry on the 8th floor was easy to use and convenient. We grabbed breakfast from the 7-11 located right below it every morning. Even though the hotel is located in the Kabukicho (red light) district, we never felt unsafe. The Godzilla show runs for a couple minutes every hour from noon-8 pm each day and we could hear it in our room on the 13th floor.

716,We had a little trouble finding the hotel as the sat  nav was playing games but actually it is very close to Shinjuku station East exit.Very nice hotel. Good amenities within the hotel and also in good proximity to dozens of good eateries on the streets.The public areas are light and spacious and the staff are all incredibly welcoming and friendly. The room was very small and not much clothes storage however this is the norm in  Tokyo and we managed perfectly fine.Space had been prioritised to include a very nice in room onsen with deep bath and wet room floor.  We really appreciated this after a few days hard sightseeing and it really helps to relax the muscles. Bed was comfy and we both slept very well.There is  novelty value in the large sculpture of Godzilla on the roof at the 8th floor. He roars and breathes smoke and fire on the hour from 9.00am to 8.00pm each day which is available to all guests.  You can see him from the street if you look from the right side!A great base for exploring the Shinjuken Gyoen National Gardens and close to the trains to get to Ueno park in Tokyo and further afield. ,"April 11, 2019","13    Hotel Gracery Shinjuku

There are a lot of places to eat at right below us and a supermarket as well.

Good breakfast selection for those who has it included, we did not and had to pay out of pocket. Decor is tired, bathroom not updated, rooms have narrow windows, no special touch. Concierge desk is busy, we had to wait 40 minutes to ask a simple question. Not good value for the money.

719,"Getting a hotel in Tokyo around cherry blossom season can be very challenging. I wanted a hotel close to a JR train station and isn't hard to find. I have stayed in Shinjuku before and have seen Hotel Gracery so I wanted to give them a try.The hotel is in a decent location. It is a short 5 to 10 minute walk from JR Shinjuku Station East entrance. The biggest problem you will have is that it is a very busy foot traffic area on the way to the hotel so you will find yourself having to dodge other pedestrians while dragging your luggage. The good news is that it is all downhill from the station so it isn't too difficult. You will find the hotel quite easily thanks to the Godzilla on the 8th floor of the building.The hotel is definitely right in the heart of all the happenings in Shinjuku. Restaurants, entertainment, and even parks are all within walking distance. Being right next to Shinjuku Station makes it easy to visit the rest of Tokyo as there are so many different trains and subways you can take. It does get busy and noisy but some people enjoy it!The staff of the hotel is great and very courteous. The check-in was a little cold but you do hear the warm greetings and the smiles as you walk through the hotel. There is definitely an efficiency in the staff as check-in and check out was very efficient. Check out was using a machine and that was very nice. The daily cleaning staff was also very polite and warm.The room is small but not unusual for the area. If you want to live in an area like Shinjuku, Tokyo Station, Ginza, etc, the rooms tend to be small. If you want hotels with larger rooms, stay in areas like Shinagawa. My main criticism of the room is that it did not even have a desk so I found myself working on my laptop in bed or at an awkward angel. The size of the room will probably also require you to do some luggage tetris as you try to leave yourself with enough room to walk around, pack, etc. The lack of a closet does mean that you should plan on living out of your luggage. I definitely didn't think the size was an issue as the room itself was functional.I got 2 free bottles of water every day which is a very nice touch. The hotel itself is quite new and everything except the internet worked well.The main reason why I gave the hotel a 3 star (instead of a 4) is the internet was really bad during my stay. It kept fading in and out. At first I thought it was just a weak wifi signal around the little table but over the 3 days, I realized that it didn't matter where I was. When the internet works, it wasn't particularly fast either. It might be the time I was there and the hotel was quite full. With that said, I do expect a hotel of this category to have functional internet which it does not.I think Hotel Gracery is a good hotel that is right in the heart of Shinjuku. If you like to stay in an area with easy access to lots of restaurants and a lot of activities, Hotel Gracery is a good choice. For me, I would not recommend it as a business hotel as it does get a bit noisy and the bad internet made it a bad option.","April 6, 2019","13    Hotel Gracery Shinjuku

We didn’t book a room with free breakfast as we were not sure if we would want to eat there every morning. Fortunately, the staff at the front desk gave us 20% coupons (approximately ¥2000/per) for breakfast buffet there. The quality of the food and the setting of the buffet line were very good, and we ended up going there every morning. There are two restaurants on the 19th floor.

The location is super convenient to everything you could want to buy, eat or do & across the road from a train station that links to everywhere. The hotel looks & feels brand new, no musty stale smells, the room was comfortable, well equipped, lovely toiletries topped up daily and the pillows were heavenly. I meant to grab the details from the label but forgot, will email the hotel to ask where I can purchase some. Had a walk around and a look at the two other hotels I was considering and so relieved I chose Century. Hotel staff very helpful and attentive.

747,"Stayed here for 4 nights. Hotel is next to JR Shinjuku and Takashimaya, however the walkways are not covered. So in summer heat and rain, you really need an umbrella. The furnishing of the hotel and the room are really dated. I was shocked that upon arrival, i have to help myself in getting my 3 large suitcases up to the receptionist hall, and even to get the trolley off the entrance lift to load it myself as there was no porter available at all. The reception area is on a much higher floor - so you are basically on your own until then. The receptionists are not friendly or helpful. The gym is outside across the road in another building and the receptionist were not very friendly in helping out with direction as well. So overall hotel experience is NOT great, except for the location.","May 12, 2019","14    Hotel Century Southern Tower

750,"3 of us shared a room - tight fit and only worked because we each had overnight/carry on luggage. Anything larger would have been a problem. Comfortable bed and 2 pillows each, plus 2 towels each which was great.Guests have access to gym across the road - excellent set up and the trainers were efficient and happy to help.Directions to hotel from Station suggest taking the South Exit, crossing the road and walking to the hotel (5 minutes max) - or there is a New South Exit which brings you out across the road and near the JR tour office (for exchanging rail pass and making reservations), a 2-3 minute walk to the hotel. We caught the airport limo bus as it dropped us at the door of the hotel - it is possible to use rail pass to catch the N'EX from Narita T3 to Tokyo but you then have to change trains to Shinjuku and find hotel. After 7-1/2 hours on a plane we're happy to go door to door!We used Plasmo cards (same is SUICA) but if catching subway (JR lines free on rail pass) more economical to purchase 2-day ticket (or 1 day) as set amount covers any number of trips on the subway.This is one of the best hotels we've stayed in when visiting Tokyo over the last 3 or 4 years. The buffet breakfast was excellent, dinner in the restaurant was very slow but worth the wait and staff happy to adjust items to ensure gluten free.We ate in one of the Japanese restaurants in the Southern Tower, and again this was an excellent choice. Shake Shack were happy to provide a gluten free burger (ie in lettuce rather than a roll).

In fact we loved the restaurant so much we also ate dinner there twice! The proximity to Shinjuku station was great, though definitely travel from the nearby Yoyogi Station for a less stressful experience (given that Shinjuku is the busiest station in the world with 3 mill people passing through daily). The noise from the trains wasn’t a problem due to the triple glazing and height of the rooms. We slept like babies—though it was always hard to draw the curtains on the spectacular view! The hotel is also opposite Times Square and Tokyu Hands, which offer brilliant shopping and dining options.

755,"We stayed at Hotel Century Southern Tower during the first six nights of our trip to Japan in March. We had planned to stay two nights at another hotel in Tokyo for the last leg of our trip (after returning from trips around Japan), but after staying here, we cancelled the other hotel, and booked the two final nights here instead. We just loved it so much. There are definitely cheaper options of accommodation in Tokyo, but our time here was worth every penny. First of all, the location is amazing. Just a couple of minutes from Shinjuku Station (South Exit) in a great part of Shinjuku, right next to the beautiful Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden. Across the street from the hotel you'll find a Takashimaya, Tokyu Hands, Uniqlo and much more, and, no matter which side of the hotel your room is, there is the most amazing view over the city. The room itself is wonderful - spacious, clean, comfortable, great facilities, great bed, great tv channel options, and every morning you'll find a newspaper by the door. We also enjoyed breakfast at the hotel every morning, and we couldn't have asked for a better start to our day. Everything at Hotel Century Southern Tower was comfortable and convenient, and the staff was amazing, making us feel like this was our home away from home. We would come back here in a heartbeat, and we will definitely stay here, when we get a chance to return to Japan.

756,"At the heart of Shinjuku , this hotel is situated at the perfect spot between Shinjuku station and to various other restaurants and shopping areas. it’s as central as you can get in Shinjuku. The rooms are very clean, the service is excellent and the staff speak English adequately enough to help if anything arises. There’s really no “con” I can say about this hotel however here’s a few key things to remember.1. The room is small compared to North American standards. That said it’s adequate but adjustments need to be made about exceptions. If you have multiple large suitcases , having the basic room might be a bit small. 2. The staff speak English perfectly well. Yes they may drop a syllable or two here and there but they aren’t reciting Shakespeare (I’m sure they could too!) so it’s more than adequate.3. There is no room service but the shop downstairs has stuff if you need essentials and there’s 7-11, Lawson’s and family mart all around. I would absolutely stay here again. The service is unparalleled and each person genuinely treats you with a smile. It’s a cultural norm, that said it’s still nice to see. If you’re reading this, you should definitely stay here.Cheers.","April 11, 2019","14    Hotel Century Southern Tower

766,"I had stayed previously at the Cerulean Tower Hotel and it was a great experience. This hotel is supposed to be a similar 4-5 star accommodation but it was a really bad experience for me. When I checked in my room wasn’t ready despite requesting early check in. When I got into the room, there was some kind of brown streak on the toilet seat. At first I thought it was a crack but I tried to wipe it just in case and sure enough it wiped off. Gross. How did the staff miss that? I had the higher end king luxury room and there’s no coffee maker (only powdered coffee) or food or beverages in the room. No room service menu and they forgot to leave WiFi info. I had to call the front desk several times for things and most of the time no one picked up, it just kept ringing. I had to physically go downstairs. They also refused to give me 2 keys even though we had two guests and I was paying for two. My last hotel gave me 2 keys even though I was solo there. The building is also very strange. The hotel lobby is on the 20th floor but the way it’s set up is you take an elevator to the lobby, walk through the lobby and take a second elevator up to your room. Not a huge problem but it’s weird. The location the hotel is in is extremely convenient to the Shinjuku Station itself but not very convenient to the popular attractions north of the station because you have to go all the way around the station and then cross a busy highway that only has a sky bridge on one side and not many crosswalks. There’s not much of interest to tourists south of the hotel. Honestly, I love Shinjuku but this didn’t feel like a great hotel for tourists. Maybe it’s good for business? Not sure. Out of the 6 hotels I’ve stayed in Japan this was the only one i didn’t like. ","March 18, 2019","14    Hotel Century Southern Tower

Location: brilliant. They have introduced ""Alexa"" systems in room for simple requests. Also had a mobile phone for my use if I required one. Bathroom small but okay. Quality toiletries (Shiseido shampoo etc)I was arriving by train to Shinjuku Station and this hotel is so easy to get from the station (very close if you have luggage). I had my luggage sent on from Kyoto to allow me to travel in some rural areas, free from carting a large suitcase (took carry on only with me). As I was checking in at Century Southern, my suitcase that I forwarded was wheeled out and placed next to me without me even asking about it! That's service!!Plenty of shops and restaurants in the area. Lots!!! Lovely Yoyogi Park & Meiju Jingu shrine an easy walk too. Shibuya is neighbouring district and I walked there through the park and along the streets. Tokyo Metropolitan Gov. Building is an easy walk. Free entry. Observation levels with panoramic (including Mt Fuji) views. Don't think I would stay in any other area than Shinjuku, and even though I could have found cheaper accommodation it wouldn't have been up to the same standard. Definitely my 'go to' hotel for Tokyo. The limo bus to the airport stops and picks up from the ground level of the hotel. So easy! Bus is a bit longer than the train to the airport, but so much less hassle if travelling with luggage. A few of the walking tours I took met near Tokyo station. This was an easy 10-15 minute train ride from Shinjuku Station. The area around Tokyo Station seemed more business; less tourist/shopping, but it is closer to the Imperial Palace. Still would choose Shinjuku area to stay as there is so much in that district.","March 6, 2019","14    Hotel Century Southern Tower

Nothing is really cheap in this area though (or I didn't find one).The room itself is pretty standard, slightly bigger I assume than other guest rooms in Tokyo. It is also quie. After all the hotel is placed at the higher levels of the buidling so you get to enjoy the view without having to bear the noise.Another thing I like about the hotel is that there is a small shop next to the elevators. If you don't want to go all the way down to the ground floor and leave the hotel in the rain just to find a Family Mart in the vincinity, you can probably get what you need at the shop. I find it very thoughful.","February 7, 2019","14    Hotel Century Southern Tower

776,"My family of four stayed in two separate kings room as all the connecting rooms were taken. The location cannot be beat - so close to transportation, eating and dining - everything you need in Tokyo is just a heartbeat away. That's the best thing about this hotel. The rooms are looking a little dated. The bathrooms even older. One great thing about the bathrooms is the full-sized bottles of Shiseido shampoo, conditioner and body wash. I detest using the small travel bottles at other hotels. And this shampoo actually clean, unlike most other hotel shampoo. We had a room on the 34th floor and the view was fantastic. We could see Tokyo Skytree in the distance the lights of Tokyo at night. The staff is efficient but not very warm or friendly. We tried to get extra room keys but was told that only one key per room was allowed due to security reasons. (we had one adult, one child per room - just wanted a second key per room so that the second adult could access the room.) It's the hotel's policy so nothing we could do, but a little annoyed. There are other hotels in the immediate area, so despite the great location, we will try another hotel should we find ourselves in Tokyo again.","January 7, 2019","14    Hotel Century Southern Tower

777,"Perfect location, just next to the new South Gate of Shinjuku station, and also just a 4 minute walk to nearby Yoyogi Station. When taking the Airport express train, get off at Shinjuku station and exit via the NEW South gate (you can exit via the South gate too, but you'd have to cross a big street) and it's only a very short walk to the hotel. The hotel is surrounded by Shopping malls and streets. Just across Tokyu Hands (amazing stationery, etc store), Takashimaya Square, Lumine, Odakyu and a very quick walking distance to a huge Don Quijote, Isetann, BicQlo (Bic Camera and Uniqlo), Muji, etc. The room size is ok per Japanese standards, very clean and it has a full stock of amenities from Shiseido, tea service and a Handy phone that you can take out of the hotel for free internet. Very helpful for using google maps to get to sites via walking or trains. We were booked at the southern terrace side, which was very quiet despite being close to the station. It has a small convenience store on the 20th floor, which is also where the lobby is. It's close to great restaurants. Shake Shack is at the basement of the building. Walking distance to Fuunji and Ichiran (great ramen), Nabezo (eat all you can hot pot), Akasaka Umaya (delicious Kyushu style hot pot), among countless others. The breakfast spread is delicious and the staff is very friendly and helpful. It got really busy during the Christmas and New Year break, that there were times we had a 15-30 minute wait for a table (esp if you get there after 9am), but the staff did their best to accommodate everyone. I would definitely stay here again, when in Tokyo.","January 1, 2019","14    Hotel Century Southern Tower

779,"Hotel Century Southern TowerWe were a family of 2 adults and 2 children and we had booked the Panoramic King Room and here’s our review of this hotel.LocationThis hotel located in the Shinjuku Southern Terrace area and is just 5 minutes away from the Shinjuku New South Exit as well as the Shinjuku Bus Terminal. If you are taking any of the JR lines, it would be optimal if you alight the train and walk all the way to the end with the “New South/Kasho Kaido” exit and you will have a short walk to this hotel. The JR East office is located at the New South Exit as well. Staying here making taking trains and buses a breeze.It is also 5 minutes walk from malls such as Mylord and Newoman whereby there are many cafes and restaurants for breakfast/lunch/dinner. Starbucks is just a stone’s throw away as well.RoomOur room was a panoramic king room with a large King Bed and 2 large windows overlooking the city. Being on the 27th floor, the view was amazing. We were facing southeast and so docomo tower and gyoen garden were in our view. There was also a small coffee table with 2 chairs for us to chill with snacks and drinks while taking in the view. The space was laid out well, enough for luggage and 2 kids playing. The binds can be controlled via a remote and the room was heated well too. The Kind bed was wide enough to fit all of us horizontally.FacilitiesThis hotel has direct luggage transfer service and we received our luggage from Kyoto and it was handed to us during check in. They also have a counter for the Airport Limousine Bus whereby you can buy tickets onsite or make payments in cash for limo bus tickets reserved online. All this was done professionally and the limo bus pick up is at level 1 of the building. We did not eat at the restaurant and ate out at the cafes around the area.In summary, our stay here was short but we enjoyed it. The hotel wins big on location, being very near to malls (Takashimaya), SHinjuku Station New South Area and Shinjuku south and it also wins big on providing a grand view of the city with its high floors and spacious rooms.","December 26, 2018","14    Hotel Century Southern Tower

780,"Being our first time in Japan, we were nervous about having a “good” hotel. Well...our worries were relieved upon arriving. Speaking no Japanese, my wife and I were greeted in English. We arrived in our room, which had an amazing view of Shinjuku and, what seemed like, all of Tokyo. The greatest part of the hotel is the location. You are, literally, a three minute walk to Shinjuku Station (reportedly the busiest train station in the world). Also, within a few minutes walk are multiple restaurants and shopping. The “mall” was also a short (2 minute) walk across the bridge. There is also a Shake Shack in the building if you are craving a burger and fries (but I advise you to try the amazing local food all around you!). The room itself was clean and comfortable. The only two downsides were that it smelled slightly of smoke (it was a non-smoking room) and that there are barely any tv stations in English...you’re basically getting CNN. Props to the hotel front desk for helping me navigate the remote and captioning! There is also a convenient lobby store that sells everything you may need. Oh...how I miss those Japanese bathrooms!Everything was super clean. The hotel restaurants were really pricey...a two minute walk yields yummy, cheaper food. Also, there is a family mart about 5 minutes away. Overall...GREAT hotel...great location...would highly recommend! ","December 23, 2018","14    Hotel Century Southern Tower

781,"I recently stayed at the Hotel Century Southern Tower with family and was pleased to find the hotel has renovated the former Tribeks restaurant to create Southern Tower Dining with an improved breakfast buffet and much updated open seating. The hotel retains its ultra convenient location, a short walk from the New South Exit of Shinjuku station which can be easily reached by the Narita Express from Narita airport. Takashimaya Times Square is just a short walk over a bridge over the train tracks leading into Shinjuku Station. The rooms are small but equipped with everything you need - mini fridge, in room safe, small TV, small table and side chair. I had a full size 30 inch suitcase so it was a bit of a struggle to find a place in the room where I could fully open up the suitcase on the floor to unpack and pack, but then again the modest size of the room was reflected in the modest price per night, about 2/3 of what I would pay for the Hilton in Shinjuku. The new restaurant where the buffet is served has beautiful new clean lines and modern seating with many options including counter seating and family style larger tables in addition to the basic two and four person tables. The buffet offerings have also been enhanced compared to my previous stays. The buffet had always been good in quality and now additional quantity of offerings has been added. There is an eggs made to order omelet station, several cooked offerings including roast pork, sausages, bacon, vegetables and a daily potato offering varying from fries to roast potatoes and a soup offering that varies from day to day instead of being just the common corn soup. There is also a section for Japanese breakfast offerings including usually grilled fish. All in all, a convenient and well priced hotel has now upped it breakfast buffet game making a good choice for a hotel in Shinjuku even better.","December 15, 2018","14    Hotel Century Southern Tower

782,"It was a little discombobulating to find that the lobby to this hotel is actually on the 20th floor of this complex next to Shinjuku Station. As well, we wondered if being next to the station, the area would be dirty and full of menacing street people, as often big city stations in European cities can be. But lo and behold none of this was true. The area - as with most places in Japan - was immaculately clean and safe and streets full of very polite, well-dressed, helpful people. The hotel had a lovely lobby entrance with bar close by and the rooms were very clean with nice views over the city. The hotel has a first-rate breakfast room/ evening restaurant which offers a very comprehensive, high quality breakfast for all tastes, Asian and Western, and is also popular for evening meals. Service was consistently excellent. But that is not at all unusual in Japan where standards of service are so much higher than in North America or Europe, even for moderately priced places. But probably the best thing about this hotel is its superb location, right next to Shinjuku Station. The area is lovely to walk, especially on the east side where there are lots of small restaurants and shops, but the whole area has a very lively buzz and no menace whatsoever in the streets, which are completely litter free and filled with well-dressed people going about their business. Being close to the station gives you easy access to other key sites, such as Shibuya Crossing, which you can get to with just a short subway ride. Our beds in the hotel were very comfortable and the bathroom fitted with all the best fixtures. Some friends complained that there were not enough hangers in the closet but we were happy with the number we had and the hotel was always willing to send up more. I would have no hesitation staying here again. We did stay before in another, older hotel nearby and we found the room too small and the breakfast rooms too crowded and the location a lot harder to access the best of the area. This hotel was a happy experience.","December 12, 2018","14    Hotel Century Southern Tower

784,"Saw the good online reviews of the hotel's location, views and rooms and decided to stay here for 5 nights. Could the experience get better? It sure can by staying in one of the hotel's ONLY 2 Executive Rooms located on the 35th floor. Room 3565 has literally 180 degree views East to South to West. On a really clear day (we only had one during our stay) you can see Mt. Fuji in the distance from your living room couch. The room has TWO toilets a shower and tub. See pics of the large glass windows that we spent lots of time day and night gazing out and looking at greater Tokyo. From the room it was interesting to see all the trains coming and going through Shinjuku station. We even had meals in the comfort of our room knowing that you would be hard pressed to find a restaurant with a view like this. This room was very large by Japan hotel standards, but it does come at a price. Save up and splurge for a special vacation. The room doesn't feel that modern and in some places it's starting to look worn, but overall it's still in good shape with a large comfy bed. My opinion is the breakfast buffet in the hotel restaurant was fine, dinners not so much. There are better options around the hotel from awesome Tonkatsu to Shake Shack. Overall, as people have said, the location is convenient and the property was nice. My only small recommendation to management is for a hotel like this it would be a nice touch if the front desk staff would recognize that you are staying in one of their premium rooms. I've stayed in this room a couple of times and while the staff is pleasant enough (almost a little robotic, not that warm), I think it would go a long way if their systems could recognize a frequent guest and welcome them back to build loyalty. I'll still come back, but it sure would make someone feel like they were returning home. If you can stay in one of the Executive Rooms, go for it. I prefer #3565.","November 28, 2018","14    Hotel Century Southern Tower

786,"Niwa hotel is on a quiet street at walking distance from the JR Suidobashi line and very close to the Jimbocho Station on Toei Mita line, which can easily take you anywhere. So the hotel is very well located in Tokyo. There are also many nice restaurants and supermarkets within walking distance from the hotel. We had breakfasts in the onsite restaurant, which was very good and with plenty of dishes (both western style and Japanese style buffet available). My only negative comment is related to the size of the restaurant, which is insufficient to accommodate all customers that come down to have breakfast, especially between 8 and 9 am. We always had to wait a few minutes for a table to be released for us, but that didn't impact my extremely positive judgment on the hotel.The hotel itself was fine. We had a triple room, which was quite large compared to the Japanese standard. The three beds were large and comfortable, with enough space to open two large suitcases (although on the floor), with all the the amenities you would expect. The bathroom was large and spotless clean. My favourite amenity was the room cell phone which you could take with you during your entire stay and that we used for free internet and maps/directions. There is also a Workout Room equipped with some fitness machines and a Relaxation Room overlooking a rooftop mini-garden, equipped with full-body massage chairs to loosen tight muscles at the end of a long day in Tokyo.

So we cancelled the idea.As we got through our 8-day stay we realised that the room was small and the double bed more like a large single provided in many hotels but we were out of the room most days and we got used to living out of our suitcases and minimising our occupation of the space available the Japanese way.The cupboard was the slimmest I have ever seen, fit only for our coats. Our clothes had to be folded and kept away in/over our suitcases if we wanted a semblance of order.But aside from the tiny room and lack of storage in the room, the bathroom was very well fitted with shelves, a collapsible string for drying smalls, baskets for towels and clothes and a most efficiently draining tub. Loved the aromatic hand/face foaming wash.The amenities outdid the lack of space: the softest most comfortable cotton pajama suit, the self-service laundry, the massage chairs free to use,the vending machine, a microwave and the pleasant out-door smoking area for those in need of it.

I except the recent popularity of this hotel and tourism boost in Japan has strengthened their business but you can find other hotels with more square feet for the price if you look around those with close proximity to a train station you are probably better off. I have recommended this hotel to several people over the years but am now recommending others which are also convenient,"December 23, 2018","15    Hotel Niwa Tokyo

803,"When I book hotels in Asia, including Hong Kong and other fairly dense cities, standard rooms often have some semblance of a view. The hotel should specifically indicate that some rooms may face another building's wall, as opposed to rooms with a view -- if I had known that the standard room may *not* to have any view (though it could be that some rooms have a view -- I don't know), I would have booked one that *did* have a view. Considering that we stayed at the property for 8 days, and that the fees we paid were not negligible, I really feel that we could have been provided a better room than one that faced a wall. Granted, the interior design had a few interesting bits, but that was something we got from every other hotel we stayed in in Japan anyway.The other issue that I had was that wi-fi was abysmally slow. While I stayed at the Niwa on holiday, I still wanted to dial in to a couple of meetings abroad -- impossible with wi-fi where it took a full 5 minutes to upload a 2 MB document.Yet another one is that for a room with two people, the storage space was almost non-existent. This was NOT true for other hotels in Japan that we stayed in, so I'd definitely say it's below standard.Would not stay here again.","December 22, 2018","15    Hotel Niwa Tokyo

The room was quiet, pretty, clean, and big enough for a solo traveler. It included a comfortable desk for working and a nice view of the city that could be screened off for privacy. The massage chairs in the lounge room were a nice perk. Also, the food at the Bar & Grill in-house restaurant was surprisingly good.","December 10, 2018","15    Hotel Niwa Tokyo

805,"I have traveled quite extensively through Asia (mostly China and Hong Kong), including 7 around-the-world trips for work in one year. This was on a personal trip to Tokyo and possibly my worst experience at a hotel. My flight got delayed in Vancouver, due to the wild fires in San Francisco. I emailed the hotel but they claimed they never received it. The hotel refused to adjust my stay, or refund me on the night I was not there. When I arrived at the hotel (at nearly 10pm after a full day of travel) they said they didn't have a record of my stay, and proceeded to charge me an additional $400 USD to stay there. Since it was so late, I had no choice. When I asked to speak to a manager, no manager came out to even speak to me or address my complaint.I got upstairs, found the room to be damn and humid. The next day, after they found my reservation, the front desk called 3 times after 11pm and on top of that never refunded the night that I didn't come OR the breakfast I had originally paid for. I have never been treated so badly by a hotel in all my years of travel. I wouldn't want anyone to stay here and be charged through natural disasters, and things out of your control.","November 19, 2018","15    Hotel Niwa Tokyo

Breakfast includes all Japanese, European & American breakfast options. Staff was very helpful for directions and for helping get our luggage from one hotel to the other. All travelers should use the very reasonable luggage system if you are traveling with anything more than small carryon luggage.

813,I stayed here for four days during a recent trip with my fiancée. The checkin process upon arrival was smoothly handled without any issues which was great after a 10+ hour international flight.We stayed in a superior double room which was generously sized. The king bed was very comfortable as were all of the linens.The breakfast buffet was delicious and had a good selection of different types of food. We both ate heartily every morning before heading out for the day.In the evenings the neighborhood is quiet and peaceful which is great after a busy day. That may seem as a downside to some individuals but I have been to Japan many times over the years.I think the value you receive for your money here is much better than if you stay near a major station such as Shinjuku or Shibuya. For a similar size and quality hotel near those areas you will likely expect to pay significantly more per night.The hotel itself is very close to a metro station as well as a JR station which can easily get you to any of the other areas of Tokyo quickly and with minimal effort. A twenty minute or less train ride can get you to almost every major point of interest in central Tokyo. All of the staff were extremely professional and polite and during our stay. I filled out the hotel questionnaire and to my surprise I received a thank you letter with a hand folded origami crane back at my home address in the US. It certainly shows a commitment to provide their guests a pleasant stay.I would definitely recommend it to anyone and will keep it on my short list of hotels for future trips back to Tokyo.,"September 25, 2018","15    Hotel Niwa Tokyo

816,"Hotel Niwa is located near Tokyo Dome, home of the Giants baseball team as well as a small theme park, shopping centre and conference venue. It is under 10 minutes from both Suidobashi stations (the nearer one having the JR Chuo-Sobu line which accepts JR Passes and connects with other major lines, and the farther having the Mita line) and it is well-signposted.On the first floor (or ground floor) are both the French-inspired Lieu restaurant (where breakfast is served) and the Japanese restaurant (where an alternative Japanese breakfast is served on weekends and public holidays, but you will have to queue from 6.30am for it as only 12 seatings are catered for). Two floors up from there is the relaxation lounge with three amazing massage chairs as well as a smoking terrace, vending machines for drinks and SIM cards, and washing and drying facilities for clothes.The rooms are a good size by Japanese standards although the long double beds are actually quite narrow for two people. Rooms include Niwa-branded pyjamas changed every day which are very soft and comfortable and which you can buy from reception. The bathrooms have the famous Toto Washlet bidet toilets and the usual amenities (razors and shaving cream, toothbrushes and toothpaste, hair brushes, cotton pad sets, shower caps, sponges). Rooms include a large writing desk with phone, a large flat screen TV, and are air-conditioned. There is also a free smartphone for use during your stay which has web browsing, social media, a camera, email, a Tokyo tourism guide, Google Maps and free international calls to certain countries. There is also a foldout storage for suitcases and a small cupboard with hangers.My only issue with the rooms is how dark they are - the headboard is backlit and there are bedside lights, and there is a downlighter over the desk which also has its own lamp, but still the room is very dark due to the fabric-effect wallpaper used and the fact the window blind can only ever be half-opened.Breakfast has an excellent selection despite being expensive (like every hotel). There are some Japanese dishes but also steamed Chinese buns, sausages and eggs and bacon, a large salad selection, good fruit selection and they will freshly cooked eggs however you like.The hotel is near Tokyo Dome for food and shopping and rollercoaster rides, but past Tokyo Dome is Tokyo's oldest garden which has a small entrance fee and is well worth a visit. Also past Tokyo Dome is the Bunkyo Civic centre (government offices). The 25th floor is a free observation floor with a very nice and very popular restaurant (expect queues). From this floor you have a panoramic view of Tokyo and can see Mount Fuji on a clear day. They have leaflets for an app which lets you take virtual tours of the sights you can see from that floor.The local JR station, Suidobashi, connects with the faster Chuo line after one stop which will take you to Tokyo station. The JR station also takes you to Akihabara which is the anime and technology district.The Mita line from the farther Suidobashi station takes you near Tokyo station directly.Getting to/from Narita airport is easy - the Airport Limousine coach runs from the Tokyo Dome hotel which is a 10-15 min walk from Hotel Niwa. Book online in advance, and pay at the travel desk next to reception in Tokyo Dome hotel 15 mins before you board the coach.","September 21, 2018","15    Hotel Niwa Tokyo

825,"Stayed 7 nights over a two week period in between travels. Overall the Niwa is a lovely, boutique style hotel. Welcoming and calming entrance. Staff is friendly once you speak with them, otherwise they do keep to themselves. Very helpful as well with directions, ideas and minor issues. Personally had no complaints or problems. I'm sure based on some of the other reviews that it is all about communicating correctly. Google is a good translator when needed though the staff did speak English well which is the best form of communication if you don't speak Japanese.The two different rooms I stayed in were spacious for Japan. The larger of the rooms had a beautiful luxurious bathroom. Quite large with a separate shower and tub with a view. Beds are super comfortable. Slept well which is not always the case for me in hotels.Rooms are very clean as well as the bathrooms. Well stocked from tea/ coffee to bathroom necessities. Depending on the floor and room, there are great city views to be had.Location wise it was just a 4-5 minute walk to Sudobashi station which I used as my main station though used the two other stations as well which were about 10-12 minutes away. Breakfast was wonderful. It's a one price meal, so I would not suggest it if that is not appealing to you.Had dinner as well. Pricey for some people possibly. Will say the food and service was very good.Five star hotel for it's really wonderful...but I like to be fair for it's not a super high end luxury hotel which has over the top service and amenities. But it doesn't need to and thankfully is not. The Niwa perfectly gives you what you need at a very reasonable price. Great as a business hotel. Great for travelers who want a quiet location and not be in the hub of Shinjuku / Ginza or the like.

The nearby area goes dull at night. No big city feel in this neighbourhood. - standard room was pretty small. I see some reviews mentioning that they are larger than other Tokyo rooms but trust me, its not suited for a longer stay if you are used to more space ( I did stay in Ginza for the 2nd leg of my Tokyo stay and the room was better there)overall, this is a nice business hotel and all the basic stuff is well taken care of.","May 22, 2018","15    Hotel Niwa Tokyo

835,"Tokyo hotels tend to be small and overpriced, some so small you can’t even open your suitcase. This place has got the price, quality and room size ratio near perfect. I grew up in Tokyo and now live overseas but when I visit Tokyo I always stay here. You will not get better value at any other hotels in the vicinity. Only a Y1,500 cab ride from Tokyo station or 10-15min train ride it is close to many of the major train hubs. Additional recommendations...1. Try the oriental bar Momo-no-mi right next door to the hotel and you will be amazed with the quality of southern Indian style curries. If unsure order the chicken curry and make sure you say “chicken curry set” which will get you all the yummy condiments. 2. Nightcap at the wonderful Bon Vivant wine bar 2 min from the hotel. Go straight for the wines by the glass, the owner behind the bar and senior sommelier Ms Etsuko will bring out some well selected bottles. Try the snacks too you won’t be disappointed, especially the cheese plate.","May 2, 2018","15    Hotel Niwa Tokyo

836,Well located with various JR and subway stations close by make this a suitable base to explore Tokyo. Friendly service and decent size rooms. We did not have breakfast included as it’s easy to find something close by in the morning. 7/11 that’s open 24h next door is also convenient when needing something small.

837,"I was very happy with the hotel overall. The room was clean, well stocked with toiletries, coffee, tea, etc and very well-maintained. The staff was courteous and very hospitable.  The hotel is a short walk from Suidobashi train station and Tokyo Dome. This was our 1st hotel stay during our 1st trip to Japan and it was an excellent pick. The high rating it receives on Trip Advisor I think is well deserved.","April 27, 2018","15    Hotel Niwa Tokyo

838,"This is the third hotel in our 10 days Japan trip and 2nd one in Tokyo. Compared to the first two, this is a total disappointment. This is the only only hotel I been to in Asia doesn’t provide coffee, the tea bags is so cheap that I found better one at 7-11 around the corner. When I request a tea set to make some tea, the answer I get was, sorry, we don’t have it; even photos of rooms with tea set on their website and poor service just ruined the whole experience. The 1/2 of the massage chairs was broken when we were their. Our experience at Celestine Hotel in Tokyo is much, much better experience.

839,"We stayed for six nights as part of the 16 day Japan journey and I am glad we had Tobu as our introduction to Japan. After arriving in Haneda airport from US/Canada, it was a quick trip via the Airport Limousine Bus with a stop right at the front door of the hotel. This convenience can’t be overstated as after a long flight, you don’t want to have to navigate the hectic Tokyo subway transfers on arrival day. Especially if you are coming in during the rainy season like we did, you don’t want to worry about dragging your luggage in the rain. It is much better with the direct bus drop off.As some have complained, the rooms are not large by US/Canadian standards. But that’s expected for a large metropolitan city. We booked a quad room and it was a bit of work to move luggage around during the night/morning to get clothes for next day. Since we were seldom in the room as we spent most of the time exploring the city, the smaller sized room was not a big issue.The additional charge breakfast was a great value considered what you get. Be sure to add that as part of your online reservation with the booking web site. It’s considerably less expensive when breakfast is added as part of the room cost versus having to pay when you are there. For the people that complained in their review that the breakfast is repetitive, the answer is yes and no. There are changes daily but it’s subtle like types of fish changes or type of pastries may change after couple days. But there is enough variety to choose from even for a 6 night stay. You just need to leave the comfort zone of always have to eat the more western style breakfast. I picked between western and eastern style breakfast daily and had plenty to eat.To save money, we didn’t get the sky tree view rooms but you can just walk right outside of the hotel and take a picture down the street. The hotel has sky tree discount tickets that you can buy at the front desk to save few dollars off of the sky tree if you plan to go to the top. We just did a leisurely walk to the Sky tree on next morning after arrival just to get a feel of Tokyo street vibe. It’s a simple 25 minute walk.There are numerous restaurants just across the street as well as by the metro station 3 blocks away. If you buy the 24/48/72 hour Tokyo metro pass (sold at front desk as well as many Tourist offices), you can go to many places in Tokyo with the pass for a set price. The hotel is located on the east side (more historical side) so if you are more interested in Asakusa/Ueno/Tokyo station (for transfer to the Shinkansen), this hotel is in a great spot. Shibuya is 30 minute away on the Hanzomon line with no transfers. Shinjuku is 30 minutes away on the JR’s Chuo line so it’s not like you are hours away from the center but if you insist to stay next to the action places, then this place is not for you. For me, it’s good to stay in the quieter neighborhood after a hectic day of sightseeing and fighting the crowd.Lastly, I appreciate hotels that respond to my inquiries prior to arrival and I emailed Tobu many times prior to arrival and they were always prompt in their reply. They even left a note at the check in that I was interested in purchasing a 72 hour Tokyo pass as I had inquired about it previously in my email so that’s part of good customer service.Overall, this is a good value for your stay, especially if you have family of 4 as not too many Tokyo hotels have 4 beds in a room and with its location/breakfast/value for money, I would highly recommend Tobu for your Tokyo stay.","July 9, 2019","16    Tobu Hotel Levant Tokyo

840,"Hotel was a relief after long flight, as it had direct airport shuttle from Narita airport (about $25 per person but worth it). Check-in easy, room for 4 people was spacious, view of the city amazing, bathroom clean, shower pressure great, very complete bathroom amenities (shampoo, conditioner, bath/shower gel, toothbrush, toothpaste, etc...). Beds and bedding were firm and comfortable, room was well air conditioned for good sleep conditions. Concierge very knowledgeable and staff very helpful and spoke english. Helped with clear instructions to every site, activity, restaurant we wanted to visit. Next to Kinschicho station and super convenient mall next door which you can access by 2nd floor of the hotel. 7Eleven, Family Mart right in front of the hotel. 24hr coin laundry mat 1 block over. Walking distance to the Tokyo Skytree and surrounding neighborhoods are the Sumo wrestling area (Ryoguku), the anime area (Akihabara), old Tokyo (Asakasa). Hotel also has free shuttle service to Disney and Disneysea which was again very helpful. Distance to central Tokyo (Shibuya, Shinjuku areas) is about 30mins but easy with the transit system in Tokyo. Very enjoyable stay!","July 1, 2019","16    Tobu Hotel Levant Tokyo

845,"My daughter was sure we were at the wrong hotel since it was on a few minutes walk to the Kinshichō Station (Sobu Line - Rapid). Since it's so close to the station, it's easy to get around to many locations in Tokyo. It's about 20 minutes walk to the Sky Tree. There are a lot of stores, eating establishments, and convenience stores nearby.The rooms are nice with AC and dehumidifiers. The rooms and bathroom were designed with foreign visitors in mind. We got two complimentary bottles of water daily. The buffet breakfast has something for everyone; the food was tasty. The downstairs coffee shop had the best shave ice...the water in imported from Nikko (according to my Japanese friend, Nikko has the best water.). It HUGE and fluffy. You have to eat it relatively quickly before it starts melting.I will definitely keep this hotel on my list for return trips to Tokyo.","May 30, 2019","16    Tobu Hotel Levant Tokyo

846,"Upon arriving at this hotel, the staff greeted us so warmly and check in was so efficient. It was lovely to be able to get to ones room quickly and to be able to freshen up for an evening of exploring. The hotel is situated in Old Town of Tokyo and I was worried that my husband and I were staying in the wrong part of town but we were not disappointed. The train station is an easy 5 minute walk away as well as shops being close by and plenty of food outlets to choose from to eat at. Convenience stores were close by too.The Sky Tree Tower looks closer than what it is - it is a 25 minute leisurely stroll away from the hotel. It too offers plenty of shopping and eating outlets.This hotel is quite large and our room faced onto the railway tracks, proving to be quite noisy especially at night but we got use to them - last train at midnight, first train at 5am. The size of our room was good and the amenities were very good.We were given 2 bottles of complimentary water each day, we had free wi-fi in our room and the bonus of being given a smart phone proved to be very valuable. Not once did we get lost travelling around Tokyo with the hotels smart phone - a big tick by us.The hotel also offered a beautiful buffet breakfast on level one each morning with a good selection of food. One morning it was quite busy due to a tour group but the hotel set up one of their conferences room as an overflow, which proved very helpful.The hotel has a lovely lobby with a special area for group check-ins. In the middle of the ground floor is a lovely cafe that provides music/entertainment at certain times - it was very pleasant having a coffee plus a cake after exploring Tokyo all day, although it wasn't cheap.The hotel provides a complimentary shuttle bus to Disneyland/DisneySea a few times a day (see the schedule) - it must be booked as soon as possible. The ride on the coach there and back was lovely.The hotel will also book any hotel to airport coach transfer on your behalf; we really appreciated this service as we expected to be lugging luggage on the trains to the airport. The cost for this transport was not too bad - we did make two other stops on the way to the airport.The hotel was very clean, modern, great large lifts, good quality towels, etc and extremely efficient staff whom seemed to love their jobs.My husband and I look forward to returning.","May 27, 2019","16    Tobu Hotel Levant Tokyo

It's one of the few hotels in Tokyo we found that accepted children and offered enough space in the room to stay together. The free shuttle bus to Disneyland is a nice bonus.

849,"Stayed for 3 nights with my husband and teenage sons (17 and 13). Check in was smooth and friendly (we had paid for early check in and that was expensive) and our room was clean and comfortable with great views of the city (20th floor). We had a quadruple room, 4 single beds in a line which was cosy (!) but there was just space enough for our suitcases etc. In other hotels in other cities we visited the “single” beds were larger divan size which on reflection was better and I would look for in Tokyo next time. The shower was very good (over a bath), good selection of free toiletries and good towels! The breakfast buffet was expensive but according to my husband and youngest son was very good. Make sure you collect your breakfast discount tokens when you check in. The restaurant on the top floor had even better views, we had a set menu available only to hotel guests which featured “Wagu” steak and it was delicious, if a bit pricey (6800 yen each, including one nonalcoholic drink).","April 15, 2019","16    Tobu Hotel Levant Tokyo

850,"I don't really understand how this place is rated so highly. I stayed 2 nights and things were really just average. The location is pretty good. Overall I wouldn't say Kinshicho is the most convenient neighborhood in Tokyo to be based in, but the hotel is less than a 10 minute walk to both Kinshicho train and metro stations, which was convenient. Nearby are plenty of convenience stores and restaurants. Like some other reviewers noted, there is some adults only nightlife in the evenings in this neighborhood, but it isn't visible in the immediate vicinity and it doesn't feel unsafe next to the hotel. Checking-in was quick and pleasant. They seem accustomed to English-speakers and other foreign guests. The lobby interior was bright and pleasant. My room had 2 twin beds and it was about average in size for this type of hotel in Japan. Everything seemed clean. The free wifi seemed adequate. The TV was ok, 2 English language channels. The AC/heater was easy to use. I appreciated the 2 free bottles of water a day. The ""Handy"" brand free smartphone was useful, even though the user interface is quite clunky and sometimes laggy. The free coffee didn't taste very good, and finding a place to plug-in the big water heater was actually a bit difficult. Not a big issue however.The bathroom was somewhat of a good surprise. Although the toilet is slightly too close to the sink, the overall size of the bathroom is slightly above average compared to other Tokyo hotels. And the bathtub is a decent size. I really appreciated that this bathroom actually has some space for your toiletries next to the sink. I just wish that they provided hand lotion. The shampoo and body wash/gel seemed pretty good.Unfortunately, 2 big problems ruined the stay for me. First, the bed was quite hard and my back was actually aching a bit when I woke up everyday. Also, there were 2 types of pillows offered, but I didn't notice much of a difference. They were both too hard and somewhat uncomfortable. The 2nd big problem was the fact that my room faced multiple train tracks, so it was super loud about every 10 minutes as the trains passed by, sometimes multiple ones simultaneously. The first time that I heard it, I actually thought that it was a monsoon storm pouring down torrential rain, which was not the case. This quickly got old and stressful. I called the front desk and complained about the noise. I asked to move to another room, but they claimed that they were all full. Perhaps this was true, but I was very dissatisfied that they could not offer another solution. If you come here, you should definitely bring earplugs, and even then, it may not be enough. At least checking out on the last day was very easy. Overall, the Tobu wasn't that bad, but given the 2 major issues, I would not come back again. If you're a light sleeper or have back problems, you should avoid this place.","March 26, 2019","16    Tobu Hotel Levant Tokyo

The breakfast buffet has a large spread with both western and Japanese food and their diner buffet isn't bad either.

855,"My family (me, my wife and 2 boys) stayed 8 nights at the hotel. Upon arrival, we were told that my 7 year old child has to pay the full price equivalent that of 1 single room for the next 8 nights even if he is sleeping with us without an extra bed - no negotiation. This was very upsetting because in Expedia, it clearly showed that the room can accommodate up to the 2 adults and 2 children. We also paid for a twin room with an additional sofa bed (total 3 beds).Fortunately we contacted Expedia through a relative in Singapore and very quickly, Expedia contacted them and we were allowed to be charged for the price of an extra bed instead. We have to accept since it is a ""more reasonable"" rate. However, our room was not changed and there were no additional bed in the room.Having started on a sour note from an overnight flight, we put that behind us and decided that it should be a great holiday.Tobu Hotel on general is situated in a very good location - one word - CONVENIENT. There were amenities, eateries, a number of supermarkets, and most importantly, connected to JR station and Tokyo subway. This helped planning travels and visiting attractions a lot easier.The Hotel is old but clean. The rooms are big for Japan standard, each bed is bigger than a twin but smaller than queen, good sized toilets with bath tubs and easy to control shower. Provided generous supplies of toiletries, towels, hangers etc. The sofa bed was initially very thin and hard, we got the housekeeping to add a layer of mattress over it and it was fine after first night. Provided a mobile device in each room for guests' navigation, though we did have our own data card. Unfortunately WIFI was not fantastic, weak or no signal when many guests are hooked on. They can't do anything about it. We had missed packing our power adapters and they were able to help us with that.Breakfast had a good spread but as all other comments you read here, served the same every other single day. On a day we could not make it for breakfast, they packed some juice and croissants for us to take on our journey.They had free Disneyland/Sea shuttle buses to take you to/fro. However, very important to reserve your seats and make sure your name is on the list. They were so strict with all these paperwork!In summary, our family enjoyed ourselves tremendously in Tokyo.

857,"Location may not be the greatest, but it's within walkable distance to the subway and JR station. We have walked about 30 minutes to the Tokyo Skytree and I thought it was a very enjoyable walk, you can to experience the Japanese lifestyle without being crowded like in Shibuya or Shijunku. From Haneda airport, there's also an airport shuttle you can take which drop you right in front of the hotel, so you don't have to hassle around the subway / JR with your luggages. Rooms are very decent in size, bigger than lots other Japanese hotel. There are 24 hours restaurants and convenient stores right across the hotel so if you are jet-lag and wake up in the middle of the night, you won't be starved. The hotel also has a shuttle to the Tokyo Disneyland. Staff are so nice and helpful, like alot of other Japanese, they may not be perfectly fluently in English but they sure did try. My mom speaks decent Japanese so we had no issues communicating with the staff and when asking for help. They surly tried to help even when they heard me speaking to my mom in English asking different questions and comments.Also, the hotel breakfast buffet is a MUST to try. It offers whole range of varieties and they even have a self-serve orange juice machine. It's about 30CAD but I found it worth every single penny.

Rooms is quit big with tea/coffee maker, 2 bottles of water wil be offered each day. Breakfast is perfect, it include western style dishes and asian corner. You can take a soft icecream if you want.","November 30, 2018","16    Tobu Hotel Levant Tokyo

862,"The hotel served us very well during our recent 8-day trip in Tokyo. We liked the fact that there was complimentary good neighbour shuttle bus service to go to Disneyland/sea theme parks from the hotel. It is recommended to book in advance though in case the bus is full. I booked it online before the trip. Very convenient! It is also a stone’s throw away from Kinshichō station which makes public transport easily accessible. We took the train on some days. Beside the train is a shopping mall which you can find almost everything you need in it like a supermarket, drug store, Uniqlo, Daiso, kids departmental store, food etc. McDonald’s and Starbucks are also available there if you crave for some non Japanese food. We also tried some eateries opposite the hotel. You can find ramen, bbq food, Japanese bentos, 7-11 etc there. Burger King and Yoshinoya are along the same street too. Spoilt for food choices. You can also book a limousine bus to/fro airports or choose to take JR line to hotel if your luggage is manageable. The hotel is also very clean. We will definitely stay at this hotel again !

863,Set up base here and travelled throughout various parts of Tokyo over 7days. Clean & good sized room that can cater to 3pax/room comfortably. 3min walk to JR/Metro Stations. Cross a road to access 7-11 & Lawson. Basic shopping needs are well catered to in the shopping malls around the area. Additional plus point.. you can take a leisure 20min stroll (with luggages!) to Oshiage Station (Sky Tower) to take the KS Narita Skyaccess to Narita Airport. Reasonable convenience given the taxi costs and complexity of navigating the rail system. Recommended !,"November 26, 2018","16    Tobu Hotel Levant Tokyo

866,"Stayed here during a week trip with 2 other friends and this hotel was everything we could have asked for. The room was spacious, and we each had a single bed larger than standard. We booked the non-skytree facing room but the view was still great, looking out over onto the rest of Tokyo. Free water bottles and the toiletries, (including toothbrushes and toothpaste!) were replaced every day, even if we left the room late and there was more than enough for the three us. The complimentary phone to use for calls and data was way over our expectations and came in extremely useful for google maps. The hotel restaurant overlooking the SkyTree was under construction and closed when we stayed but this didn't affect us and we heard no noise within the hotel, despite being in a quieter area of Tokyo but still has a lovely atmosphere and night life with lots of places to eat nearby. There's also a shopping centre and a JR station around a 3 minute walk away which was a nice surprise!Would definitely come back, this was the best hotel i've stayed in yet! And affordable!","November 10, 2018","16    Tobu Hotel Levant Tokyo

Tobu Lavant Tokyo sports sapacious family room with lovely view of the sky tree tower made it even better. Located just 5 minutes walk away from Kinshicho statione this hotel whilst being well connected to the city is protected from the hustle and bustle of Tokyo. Friendly and helpful staff make the stay here pleasurable. The breakfast on offer is very good and the hotel is ideally located for taking leisurely walks.

We were pleasantly surprised at how large the room was (2 twin beds and additional couch that turned into another twin). They still used china cups for coffee/tea. towels were supplied everyday as well as toothbrushes/toothpaste and a large abundance of shampoo/conditioner & body wash.The beds were very comfortable and we were able to adjust the heat and air conditioner to suit us at any time. I can't recall exactly how much we paid for each night of stay but knew it was reasonable and would stay there again in a heartbeat!

Whilst slightly dearer, would recommend paying for this upgrade.The hotel is in a good location to explore the city and the nearest station a five minute walk away. Rooms in the hotel are smaller than most western hotels. However, immaculately clean, comfortable and satisfactory for our needs. A good addition is the smart mobile phone for use by guests to gain access to the internet in the city and indeed phone internationally at no cost.Hotel staff are extremely helpful and very polite.

872,"We stayed here for 6 nights in a quadruple room. We had the best view of the Skytree. The room is small compared to hotels in the US but a decent size for Tokyo. Beds were super comfy. The shower was to die for. Wonderful pressure and a huge tub for Asia. The hotel shampoo, conditioner and body wash were all Shesiedo. They smelled heavenly. I really wanted to purchase them but couldn’t find them in the stores. Housekeeping was immaculate in tidying up the room and replenishing toiletries and amenities. The hotel provides free water daily and there’s an ice machine near the elevator. Everyone at the hotel were super polite and helpful.The wifi was a bit tricky but once we asked the front desk we were able to utilize it. The rooms were not completely soundproofed, we could hear our neighbors next door banging around and some stomping, running noises from the floor above. It was not too bothersome since we were out most of the day.The location is great. It is about a 20-30 min walk to Skytree or one metro station away. The metro and Jr are about a 5-10 walk away from the hotel. There are two huge supermarkets near the train station Seiyu and Japan Meat. The mall near the train station has many restaurants on the 10th floor. The restaurants close at 10:30 pm so you can have a late dinner. There are two French bakeries nearby and tons of restaurants around the station. The mall also has Uniqlo, Muji, Gu, and Daiso.The hotel has limousine bus pickup and drop off from both Narita and Haneda airports.We would definitely stay here again. We miss Tokyo already.

874,We recently stayed at Tobu as a family of 2+3. The staff we encountered were all very friendly especially the receptionist who helped me find a Dr on a Sunday after my daughter put beads in her ears and the gentleman who checked us in. The rooms were all very clean and stocked thank you housekeeping. The fact Tobu has rooms that can accommodate us in one room made things so much easier. The mobile phone available in the room to take out with you was a fantastic and such a great idea. Location wise we found really good easy to get around. There’s a playground five minutes down the road super helpful with kids. Plus there is the free bus to Disney which makes a long day easier. Our only negatives were the coffee prices in the lobby lounge was excessive and the breakfast buffet was a little repetitive after a week. I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend this hotel to family and fiends. We will stay here again when we return to Tokyo.,"September 17, 2018","16    Tobu Hotel Levant Tokyo

875,"We selected Tobu Hotel Levant Tokyo because of other great tripadvisor reviews, its location and value. Needless to say, we were not disappointed. This hotel is located 3-5 min walking distance from Kinshicho station which has both subway and JR train (Sobu line direct to Narita, without transfers for 1,350 yen) and it takes about 20 to 40 min to get to other areas of interest inside Tokyo. There is a Limousine bus direct from Narita to the hotel but it's only offered twice a day. This hotel also offers a free shuttle bus to and from Tokyo Disneyland which is great if you have little kids, specially on the way back when they are tired. You can also buy Disney tickets at the front desk and skip the 30 minute ticket line at Disneyland (keep in mind that the hotel does not sell fixed-date Disney tickets, which we did not mind, since the crowd forecast was good mid-week)Our room was spacious for Tokyo standards and contained every known gadget and necessity. The cleaners were excellent and very detailed. There was an ice machine in the hallway. The TV offered mostly Japanese TV with one channel that had occasional English news. We were also offered an android cell phone which had unlimited data and voice and was indispensable for google maps and street directions. You could also download apps from Google Play - we downloaded google translate, Tokyo subway app and TDR Alert for Tokyo Disney wait times. The phone's user interface was a bit clunky and ad-supported, but it was a great free service by the hotel. The mattresses were comfortable. There was just a bit of outside noise from the trains and some minor noise from people passing in the hallway, but no different than most places. The email communication with the hotel prior to our arrival was prompt and all of our many questions have been answered in great detail. Everyone from cleaning staff, managers, concierge and the front-desk staff were very polite, knowledgeable and always very helpful. There are 2 convenience stores (Lawson's and 7 Eleven) right across the street from the main entrance and 2 french bakeries (one in the train station and the other one next to the southern entrance) There are many restaurants on the side streets and an entire floor of family friendly restaurants on the 10th floor of the nearby Arcakit shopping center. In case it rains, you almost don't need an umbrella and can go strait from terminal 2 of the train station to the Arcakit shopping center which has hotel access on the second floor (west gate). If it doesn't rain there is a big park nearby (Kinshi park) that has a playground for kids. Across the street from the Kinshicho station (east side) there is an escalator access to the basement of the Rakutenchi building with a big supermarket that's affordable and has a pastry section and a large take-away food section with a very large inventory of prepared foods and sushi. Rakutenchi building also contains several restaurants and fast food places (including KFC and a Subway) as well as a 24/7 onsen (spa) on the 9th floor. Overall - this was a great choice and gets five stars for location, service, convenience and for solving a lot of issues tourists face in Tokyo.","September 12, 2018","16    Tobu Hotel Levant Tokyo

We were on the second floor, by request, and it was super fun! The staff was great, very helpful. But we did not love the area. A little seedy, frankly. There is a lot of shopping and sights in the Shibuya area. This hotel is close to the station - but do NOT try to lug big (or even small) luggage in this area. But there are a lot of bars surrounding. Our last night, being a Friday night, was ridiculously noisy. Realized as we were leaving for our flight to go home Saturday morning that there was a bar across the street with their windows wide open. That was the source of the noise all night - and they were still going strong. I didn't enjoy the restaurant just across the street but there was another a couple of blocks away that was wonderful and I wish I knew the name - on the receipt, it translated by Google to Chinese Ramen, I believe (it was across the street from an Outback).","May 25, 2019","17    SHIBUYA HOTEL EN

895,"This hotel was reasonably priced for the location. Includes everything you need (clean, up to date, water included). The staff are friendly and accommodating.The room is very small (which makes sense in Tokyo) and if you are travelling with friends you may find the clear bathroom uncomfortable (as mentioned in other reviews). While there are curtains it may still be a little awkward. As a couple it wasn't issue, however I did find it added a clinical feel to the room which wasn't the best.We found the mattress to be too firm for our tastes and it did give both my partner and me sore backs. If you prefer a firmer mattress this may be great.Being in Shibuya the location is great, and the part of Shibuya it is in is nice. There are loads of food options and it is just the right amount away from the crazy Shibuya crossing. On the downside it is quite a walk (just under ten mins) to the train station. There were no laundry facilities and there is no wash and fold within walking distance. There is a coin laundry nearby.I would stay here again, however would prefer something closer to a station (even if it meant being in a less popular spot i.e. outside of Shibuya).","April 29, 2019","17    SHIBUYA HOTEL EN

896,"Perfect location in Shibuya. Friendly and English speaking staff. Room was small but most places are in such an ideal location. Breakfast was included at no charge- coffee, toast, pastries etc. room was cleaned daily. Great ramen spot just across the road that is open until 4am. We really did enjoy the location! Each floor has a quirky decor. Would definitely stay again!","April 5, 2019","17    SHIBUYA HOTEL EN

897,"We stayed here for three nights and its location is brilliant. After spending only 10 days in Tokyo as a tourist, Shibuya is the part to stay in. The hotel was nice, offered a free breakfast but foremost - the staff was brilliant and very service orientated. Booked an Executive room and to my surprise it has a massage Chair.The only downside... it was difficult to find. The entrance is Cool but very anonymous. So we walked by it. GPS does not work very well due to it comes in ”shadow mode” at the narrow alleys. It is a short walking distance from the Metro station, Starbucks, Tully’s and a load of rock clubs! Highly recommend this hotel.","March 19, 2019","17    SHIBUYA HOTEL EN

898,"Well remodeled hotel near the center of Shibuya!It almost look like an old apartment complex that was converted into a boutique hotel and they did a lot to make the small space feel modern. Yes, the shower / bathroom are all windows which gives it a modern feel and makes the small space look bigger at the same time. Don't worry there are curtains if you want privacy. The whole room has everything put away to conserve space. Yes, the hallways are decorated differently on each floor.Toto bathroom was top of the line. The bathroom had some motion detection that gets the everything ready for you as soon as you walk near it. Smell? none. Poo? gone. Seat? Warm. I will buy that bathroom one day. Bed was comfortable. They are proud of it that they have paperwork talking about who made it.Finally a hotel that offers decent speed wifi. 50mbps. It's not fast, but most hotels get tourists downloading movies all day killing internet for the rest.The service was superb. Was about to buy an umbrella. Then the worker said don't buy one, and handed one to borrow for free.Location? Literally go outside and you are next to a TON of food choices and even night clubs and stores. It's a very good location if you want to be in the middle of action. The constant load of people does get tiring though.Price is great if you keep an eye out on the room rate. The price fluctuated a lot. I recommend booking a cancellable room. I was able to book for about $150/night. The price kept fluctuating between $150-250.Was able to hear a lot of noise outside. People slamming the doors or just stomping on the floor above. Not sure where it was coming from but people are quiet after 10pmish.The front door when entering was VERY heavy.Like many Japanese hotels, you need to turn in your key before leaving. This feels secure and not secure at the same time. You don't have to worry about someone stealing your keys and going to your room, but at the same time, the workers can just hand your keys to someone random.Overall, this place offers great value for a unique stay.","March 3, 2019","17    SHIBUYA HOTEL EN

There was adequete desk space for us to do some work from our laptops too!The staff was extremely helpful in booking restaurant reservations for us at places that did not speak English.

902,"We stayed here for only a night or two but it was comfortable enough. Clean and small but we only had carry ons so really didn't need much. The location is great for visiting Shibuya crossing and the area around it. When we visited, there was a little continental breakfast included. It wasn't the greatest, but good enough. The bathrooms are odd because they have glass instead of walls. I smashed my head into the door because it was clear and I'm a big moron. So. Be careful of those bathroom doors!","December 20, 2018","17    SHIBUYA HOTEL EN

There were added value that we were not aware of a simple breakfast was served in the bar which was a nice surprise, since it's so hard to find western breakfast places in Tokyo, and a free drink for guests in the bar when the DJ was playing which was also very nice. There as no wardrobe and almost no space for storing but it was worth it. Can't imagine a better location when staying in Tokyo.","December 11, 2018","17    SHIBUYA HOTEL EN

The location is incredible - only a short walk away from the amazing shopping, food, and scramble crossing in Shibuya. And less than 10 minutes walk from the JR station. The room was quiet, beds were very comfortable, and the bathroom was big in comparison to many of the other places we stayed in Japan. Staff were very attentive and lovely.

The decor was beautiful with lovely curtains that could be draped around the bed- very snuggly!The room, like most places in Japan, was incredibly clean and tidy with a fantastic shower with so many different functions to enjoy and relax to!As mentioned, there are small pastries, coffee, juice available for breakfast which is the perfect early morning snack as breakfast was a challenge for us westerners! Overall, it was the perfect relaxing rest from the busy Tokyo outside- a very quiet, peaceful space.Worth every penny and would definitely return back- across the road was a brilliant 500 yen bar too!

908,We stayed here in September for our anniversary and this was a new ce hotel. The staff were friendly and helpful. We forgot our key on the door and they were nice enough to keep it with them until we got back. The room was a good size with a good size bathroom. The only thing wrong is how close the put the toilet to the wall. But other than that the room was clean and nicely presented. It was about a five minute walk to Shibuya Crossing and close to the shops. We even got a drink voucher on check-in at their bar which plays great music.,"September 30, 2018","17    SHIBUYA HOTEL EN

Not terribly loud but you can notice it if you wake up in the middle of the night. Also, you must leave your key at the desk when you leave.Overall, I’d stay here again.

They still use keys here so you are required to drop off your key at the front desk before you leave the hotel and pick it up upon return. The front desk is open 24/7. Housekeeping did a great job of freshening the rooms daily.Rooms: Space is a premium in most buildings in the city of Tokyo. With that, expect a smaller room but designed well and clean. My studio room with one bed was tight in space but I never had any issues with it being too small. The bathroom was well stocked with essentials in case you forgot to pack something.Location: Location Location is key and Shibuya Hotel En is in a great one. It is walking distance from the Shibuya Scramble crossing and the Shibuya JR station. Most importantly, the Golden Ball Bar is literally across the way and there's all kinds of late night dining options within walking distance. The Mega don Quixote for souvenir shopping and Lawon's are nearby. Miscellaneous: In the morning, they have a free breakfast of pasties, croissants, coffee juice and tea in the bar. Each floor is decorated to a Japanese theme and are great social media moments. I paid $149 a night and would definitely do it again taking everything Shibuya Hotel En has to offer.

916,"My wife and I booked this hotel in late May. It was our first time in Japan, so we researched extensively to choose a hotel that was affordable and had a great location. Shibuya Hotel En, was the choice for us for our 4 night vacation.Only a 7 minute walk from Shibuya Station/Shibuya scramble. It was easy to navigate to the hotel with our luggage. Once we arrived, the employees were super nice and was able to communicate in English very well. The room was small, but we expected that staying in Tokyo. My wife and I managed with 2 large luggage comfortably around the room (getting dressed, showering, packing and so on). The size of the room isn’t much different than a boutique hotel in Manhattan. The bed was comfortable. The room was clean and organized. The tv was huge. And the bathroom was superb. We didn’t care so much about the glass windows that surrounded the bathroom. The toilet was super clean and high-tech. And the shower was awesome especially after a 16 hour plane ride and walking around Tokyo all days we spent there. We both felt super clean and refreshed.The location was great. It was quiet, there was a 7-11, family mart, and Lawson’s all in walking distance. Only minutes away from shopping and eating. And only a 7 minute walk to Shibuya Station, which was ideal for us because we used the train to go where we wanted to go.Overall we loved the place and we would gladly stay here again on our future trip back to awesome Tokyo!","June 6, 2018","17    SHIBUYA HOTEL EN

917,"I booked 4 nights at the Shibuya Hotel En to start a 4 week holiday in Japan. I booked on Agoda and thought $1,200 Australian dollars for 4 nights was expensive but maybe that was typical Japan. Well, it wasn't. I had a 21 day rail pass and travelled from Tokyo up to the top, Sapporo on Hokkaido, and down to the very bottom of Japan, Ibusuki on Kyushu. The Hotel En was double anywhere else and I stayed in a couple of 4 star hotels. The room was small (12 square metres), the bed had a wall on each side so I had to crawl up from the bottom which was difficult with a cup of coffee. Breakfast was bread and coffee. It was ridiculously overpriced. On my return to Tokyo I stayed in a different area called Ueno. I booked into the Mitsui Garden Hotel at 12,500 yen versus 24,000 at the Hotel En. Ueno was a much better hotel as it had a proper sized rom, there was a very big park close to the hotel with a zoo, National Art Galley and museum and right next to the subway. Hotel En was about 1 kilometre plus from the subway. We live and learn. If the management add an addendum to this criticism don't believe it. It's a rip off. ","May 17, 2018","17    SHIBUYA HOTEL EN

Corridors are themed per floor. The anime theme was kinda cool.  Choose a higher room so that it would not be too noisy at night as there is a bar at first level below the hotel room.Location is not very near the main Shibuya area so you have to walk a little. Near convenience store, family mart across and a little far away down the street is Lawsons. There are restaurants and coffee shops around the area so that is pretty cool. Staff are friendly, and we are accommodated to leave our luggage after check out since our flight is late in the afternoon. They will provide you with luggage number tag so that you can safely claim your stuff later on. So we had extra time to explore the areas around for eating and shopping a little more before heading to the airport.

923,"Shibuya station was about 10 minutes walk to the hotel. If taken the main road to the hotel, the pathway was pretty levelled. Otherwise, it will be a up and down hill walk through the small route. We had a large luggage, therefore it took us 15minutes to reach the hotel. When we reached the hotel, we were alittle taken aback as we could not find the entrance at the main road. The main entrance was at the side road with 2 large wooden door that was closed. Initially, we though the hotel was closed down as 2 other guests were as confused as us. We tried pulling open the door, we saw the reception area. I guessed it was hotel effort to make the hotel look chic. However, it may not be chic for guest to pull open a heavy door to enter themselves. After a minor scare, we were attended by a warm staff was spoke good English. We were given coupon for free drink at the bar and was informed of free breakfast. The breakfast was simple with bread, soup and coffee or juices but enough to fill you up if you don’t mind the limited food choice. Having said that, we could not complain as the breakfast was complimentary. We were also told to leave the room key at the counter which I would not done so if I was given a choice (as I forgot my room number and was more of a visual person). The room was decorated with style. However upon reaching the room, I was surprise that the toilet were transparent. As we were not used to being nude, it made accessing the space near toilet inconvenient as the sink was there with double mirror. The room were the typical size that does not allow opening of 2 large suitcase simultaneously. There was no space left to walk after opening 1 large luggage. Noted from other reviews that it defer from room to room. We booked a double room which was near the lift. However, the bed was really comfortable and of good size as compared to other Japan hotel. It comes with double pillows for each person. There were basic toiletries such as shampoo, conditioner, body scrub towel, body foam, toothbrush with toothpaste, hair dryer, towel and hangers. They replace the toiletries daily. The best part of staying in this area is that it is close to all the shopping area. Don Quijote which was opened 24hours was just few minutes away (sell food, clothes, comestic, furniture and much more with immediate tax rebate when u spend a certain amount). The was a large Uniqlo and MUji nearby too. ABC mart which sell shoes was close too. On the last day, we took the train to the airport with 2 luggages each. We bought a ticket for 550yen at JR counter for the Yamanote Line and the Keikyu Line to the airport. Just needed to flash the ticket. At the Yamanote Line, we travelled from Shibuya station to Shinagawa Station using the south entrance as there was no escalator at The Central entrance. The staff was kind enough to tell us to use the south entrance where the escalator was at Shibuya station. Upon reaching Shinagawa, we needed to exit the station to change to Keikyu Line. At the platform, the were 3 different queue. If I did not remember wrongly, the blue Color queue sticker, was to the airport. The entire journey took about 40 minutes (we travelled during non-peak.) May have difficulties getting on the train if on peak period with luggages.

924,"As newcomers in Tokyo we thought we'd be able to find the hotel easy peasy. Boy were we wrong! The hotel is a bit hidden, but once found it is easy to get back to again once you have walked around in the area a bit (it is close to the Shibuya Station which helps).First impressions were great - a friendly staff greeted us with a smile and made the check-in process fairly smooth. The rooms are extremely comfortable and well designed. If you like to sleep, you will not want to leave these beds - it is like Mr. Sandman designed them himself! The hotel was renovated not too long ago and it shows! It is definitely great value for your money. Especially if you are a gang of friends travelling. There are many bars and clubs in the area - especially one across the street called ""Oiran"". One thing I have to add is that there is no noise from those bars/clubs, at least if you are not high up in the hotel.In the morning there is a small breakfast included. It is funny that (even though they are frozen) these croissants were amazing and combined with the a nice coffee it is an excellent start on your day! I would recommend this to anyone.","January 12, 2018","17    SHIBUYA HOTEL EN

925,"The location can’t be beat! It was a little tricky to find the first time (it’s on a small side street), but the hotel is minutes away from Shibuya Station, as well as countless shops and restaurants. The free croissants, coffee and juice for breakfast are perfect and the staff is super friendly. We stayed during the weekend and were offered a couple of free drinks at the bar, as well as free candies and celebratory tea in the lobby as a New Year’s gift.The room was small, but functional. Comfy bed, mini fridge and all the amenities we needed. Note: the bathroom is enclosed by glass, but there IS a curtain you can close for some privacy.","January 10, 2018","17    SHIBUYA HOTEL EN

926,"I've stayed at the hotel with 3 others. We booked 2 rooms for a total of 5 nights. Checked in twice for our stay as we checked out for a day when we travelled to Hakone.During the first check in we noticed that one of the rooms was slightly smaller than the other. But the difference wasnt great and we understand it's normal for the size of the rooms to be a little different so it didn't bother us. However, on our second check-in we were rather puzzled when we were given significantly smaller rooms. (We had booked the same room type for all 5 nights) From a rather spacious room where we can open two big luggage and still have walking space to a room where we can only open one luggage with not much walking space. When we checked with the reception we realised that the range in room sizes for the same room type was rather big. If one is lucky they would get the bigger room which we got for our first check in. In the end we decided to pay an extra 1000yen/nights to upgrade our rooms. The amount of space we got for tt extra 1000 yen was rather significant. The room was spacious and one could open 4 big luggages and still have a lot of space. The large room was definitely worth it. But we did prefer the rooms we got for our first check-in as the sink was not in the bathroom, this reduces washing up time as one could use the bathroom while the other wash up at the sink. I had made this reservation through booking.com. Not sure if that is why there is such a significant difference in room size for the room we reserved. Perhaps it might be better to book the room through the hotel website where there more details on the different room types. Besides the odd room sizes, we enjoyed our stay at the hotel. The location was good. The rooms we stayed in were clean and tidy. Staff were also polite. The complimentary water, tea and coffee were topped up daily. Would definitely return to this hotel if I ever travel to Tokyo again.","January 6, 2018","17    SHIBUYA HOTEL EN

927,"Just walked into our room and I have to say it’s very underwhelming. The first thing to noice is the complete lack of privacy from the toilet to the shower to the bed room. The door to the toilet seems to be missing some blinds too.The room doesn’t seem very clean compared to the other hotels we have stayed in during our time in japan. You can see very visible marks on the walls, dust on top of the tv etc and lots of watermarks. The toilet paper dispenser isn’t even straight to that give you a sense of the attention to detail. The shower area also doesn’t smell cleanYou get bottles of weather in the fridge, which is pretty common for hotels in japan and the hotel itself seems to be in a fairly decent spot.You only get one key and it’s an old fashioned KEY which you need to leave behind with reception each time you leave and it seems anyone can access the lift because you don’t need a key / cars access to press a floor number.

928,"Had a great stay here from 12/25-12/27 during a layover. Check in was very easy after a long travel day (more on that later).Rooms are SMALL as expected for Tokyo but very CLEAN and modern. The bathroom was our favorite part - the toilet and bidet was super cool. Toilet cleaned itself when you open the door and after you leave, seats are heated, automatic flushing. The shower got hot very quickly, was easy to use (no fumbling around to find which direction is hot), and the pressure was great. Most importantly the bathroom was spotless. We ran into the glass door several times because it was so spotless.Bed was very comfortable - one of best we’ve stayed in. We were provided with robes & slippers. Loved the robes so much I bought them when checking out. I thought this hotel was non smoking however several times smelled cigarettes in the hallways. It didn’t bother me enough to complain but just FYI - smell was there. I was on level 4.Major tip: WALK from Shibuya Station to hotel! Literally a little over 5 min walk from Hachiko exit. We didn’t do as much research and thought Shibuya Crossing would be too daunting to walk when getting in from airport with our luggage. Ended up waiting over an hour in the taxi queue. Was a waste with the limited time we had in Tokyo. Taxis weren’t as easy to get in Tokyo as other places I’ve traveled.","December 28, 2017","17    SHIBUYA HOTEL EN

929,"I don't normally write hotel reviews because for the most part, they're all the same. But I need to take the time to call out the fantastic customer service we had from the team at Hotel En. They were incredibly helpful in setting up a couple reservations for us-even when our first choices weren't available and we ended up changing our minds. When we wanted to send our luggage ahead to our next location, but couldn't drop it at a hotel since we were staying at an Airbnb, they offered to call the pick up point and arrange the delivery there for us instead. The staff were incredibly attentive and eager to help no matter what we needed.The location was fantastic-you're less than a 10min walk to the station and right next to all the shopping/main attractions of Shibuya. But my favourite part of the location was if you walk North towards Yoyogi park, you'll enter this residential area with lots of fantastic small bars/cafes/restaurants. It's a great respite from the chaos of the rest of Shibuya.One word of warning-the room has a glass bathroom, so probably best suited for couples/solo travellers.","November 23, 2017","17    SHIBUYA HOTEL EN

930,"Shibuya-En is a relatively new hotel with modern facilities. The location is excellent - approximately 10 minutes' walk from the Shibuya station but 0 minutes to some fantastic ramen (open late) and shopping. Hotel staff are friendly and we had no trouble with communication with English.We stayed on the 5th floor which had a quaint view of the city surrounds. Our room was accessed by a short beautifully decorated corridor, and the room was a decent size with a glass-walled bathroom (curtains for privacy). The toilet was high-tech (as expected in Japan) with a clean sink and shower which had excellent water pressure. The double bed was firm but comfortable. The room came with green tea and cute decaf coffee sachets which came with their own filters - we hadn't seen that before! Pyjamas and room slippers were provided. Breakfast was offered from 7:30 to 9:30am daily - small pastries, coffee, tea and juice.The thing that really won me over was the excellent shoe horn they had by the door. But that may not be a game-changer for anyone else.","November 3, 2017","17    SHIBUYA HOTEL EN

933,The rooms were spotless and comfortable. The staff were friendly and exceptionally helpful. The hotel is a little hard to find but in a great location and I did not find it noisy (8th floor room). The only disappointment was the breakfast which was basically just french pastries. For coeliacs travelling this is an issue as there are few cafes with gluten free options - so having breakfast in the hotel is important.

936,"The thing I appreciated most about the hotel is the location in Shibuya. The staff is nice although they caused some problems with my credit card and I am still waiting for a reply from them...since the 12th of august and today it is the 28th.ROOM: it is average, not as cramped as many rooms in Tokyo that you can get for the same price. Don't expect too much room anyway, the pictures of the rooms that I see on TA are not remotely like the one I stayed in. Mine was 10-11 square meters. The bathroom has glass walls...which is a bit annoying if you are not alone (see attached pictures). They have blinders of course but the bathroom door didn't have anyThere is a safe in the room and complimentary coffee and teaEach floor as a theme, which I found nice.BREAKFAST: come on!!!! seriously they call that buffet? There were 3 types of small croissants, coffee and orange juice! Plus something that I tried only once, it was something salty with yogurt I think.

937,"This place was great! My husband and I stayed for three nights as the beginning leg of our honeymoon. We arrived to Tokyo at midday and although we could not check in until 3pm (as stated on the website so I knew this already), the staff kindly took our big bags whilst we killed some time. The location is perfect and in the heart of Shibuya. There are loads of eateries everywhere and loads of side streets to explore. Check in was a breeze and our bags had already been taken to our room. As expected, the room is not huge. It is however exceptionally clean and lovely to look at. All basic amenities and more were provided, included some very nice green tea and decaf drip coffee which serves as it's own filter. If you're a guest at the hotel, a basic but really tasty breakfast is included in the price. One thing I would say, is the bathroom is novel in that the walls are all glass. Theoretically, you could see someone on the toilet or showering. There are blinds to pull down though so it's ok. HOWEVER, the glass is very very clean. I walked into it more than once. So be warned! The only other thing is that there is no wardrobe (an overhead one only over the sink) and not a huge amount of floor space. This was fine for us as we were only using backpacks and there for three nights but may be an issue for others with large luggage. The staff are really friendly and seem to enjoy their jobs which is great to see. Finally, all floors are differently themed. I came across this accidentally when I pressed the wrong button to leave the lift. We were on level 7 which was decorated like temple gates - my personal favourite. Others were cherry blossom, anime etc. Really interesting little place! I would definitely book this again should I ever return to Tokyo. ","August 17, 2017","17    SHIBUYA HOTEL EN

940,"Intro:I’ve stayed at this hotel the last 2 trips to Tokyo, and would definitely stay here again! Getting to the hotel:It’s just a short walk from Shibuya station so it’s very easy to get here. I do however recommend taking a taxi to the airport if you have a lot of luggage as the streets of Shibuya around the crossing can be mental! If your are taking the train to the airport I highly recommend sorting out your return ticket for the Narita Express immediately or the day before your going back. The queues can be super long and please allow for plenty of time for the trip to the airport! The Location:Outstanding. You are right in the middle of exciting Tokyo and everything it has to offer. Restaurants, shopping and fashionable people! The Room:The rooms are small! But hey, that’s Tokyo! It seems to be newly renovated so it’s clean fresh and comfortable. The mattress and pillows are FAB! Good to know:Breakfast is included, but it’s only coffee/tea and croissant/pains. Customer Service:The first time I visited this hotel I was really not that happy, the secod time however I was very surprised.

942,"Hotel was a bit tricky to find at first, but once you get there and get a sense of the area, then it's actually a great find. Pros:1. The location is about 7-10 mins walk from the main Shibuya station. Head toward H&M after the Shibuya crossing. It's not too far from there on your left. Lots of restaurants, cafe and shops all around. We just love the energy in this part of Tokyo (we've been many times).2. The room size is actually decent for Japanese Standards. We've experienced some smaller compact ones, and this hotel is just fine. Rooms are modern and clean. It has all the amenities you need, toiletries, coffee and green tea and a yukata to wear. Great water pressure shower! Don't be alarmed by the room and bathroom size, this is actually pretty good! and Very clean :)3. Free pastries (croissants) + coffee in the lobby from 7:30-9:30am.4. The staff at the reception was very helpful regarding our next destination as far as logistics and really helped us out with the transportation timetable.Cons: The hotel is boutiquey-modern type.

A little tough to find at first when we got out of Shibuya station, but once you get your bearings it's a great spot. A little under a 10 minute walk to Shibuya station. Lots of restaurants within a couple minutes walk. Can be a little noisy on the weekend, but that didn't bother us.Room: Small, but that's normal for Japan, and it didn't bother us. Bed was fairly comfortable and the room had all the amenities and was always spotless. My one major complaint about the room is the weird glass cubicle for the toilet and shower. There were curtains and blinds around it, but they didn't quite close properly and you could see through the gaps in them. We made it work, but I wouldn't recommend it for anyone who doesn't know each other very well. It's a little awkward. Would probably be a great room for a solo traveller though.Staff were excellent.

944,"This hotel was better in retrospect than we felt at the time. It was our first stop in Japan, and although our room well clean, it was tiny, little room for suitcases, nowhere to sit because we used the chair to store things, and the bathroom/toilet cubicles seemed simply........odd! Turns out they are standard in Japan, shower was great water pressure, everything sparkling clean and we became used to the tiny sizes over time. The staff here are friendly, good housekeeping, our room tidied and cleaned beautifully each day. Breakfast that was included in our booking was simply 'coffee and bread' (a selection of croissants, Danish pastries and a local cake item, with juice/water and machine coffee, but in a pleasant environment. Decor is different on each floor, slightly quirky and interested. In retrospect, we would stay here again as the rates are moderate, room really clean and excellent, convenient location. There are many bars, cafes and restaurants in the surrounding streets. 'Love Hotel' Hill is adjacent and some of the bars get pretty loud during the night but that seems part of the location and atmosphere. One morning I woke up thinking that the crowd was very loud outside, to find sun coming up at 0530!!! Tokyo folk love to party, clearly, and around this hotel is a prime area! If noise bothers. you, perhaps ask for a room that doesn't face forwards to avoid the bars and late night/early morning noise. Good amenities provided and overall excellent value for money.","May 10, 2017","17    SHIBUYA HOTEL EN

953,"This a quaint, boutique-style hotel, a short walk from the famous Ginza strip and Mitsukoshi Department store. The rooms were tiny but very clean and comfortable, that is, if you don’t plan on bringing large suitcases. We upgraded to the “larger” Privilege Room with two single beds, and this was a better fit for us. The breakfast buffet was adequate, but could do with some daily changes, as they served us, the same exact fare every day. What made this hotel shine was the fantastic service of the hotel’s staff, most especially the ladies behind the front desk. They made sure we were comfortable and met our needs, even calling for certain places we had to go to, without complaint and always with a smile. One of the best hotels that I’ve been to, that made us feel welcome and at home. I would highly recommend this hotel.","June 3, 2019","18    Mercure Tokyo Ginza

It proved the perfect base to shoot off to both Shibuya and Asakusa on the metro.

957,"Wow, what a nice and fancy Hotel! We arrived after a japan cruise in that Ginza hotel. This is located in the heart of Tokio, called Ginza, where you have nice shopping street ""Ginza"" and all luxury shops literally around the corner. it is easy to get to Ginza hotel which is subway station Ginza and has got underground metro access. when we arrived at the reception desk we could feel the entire friendliness of Japan. You feel like a prince, they treat you super nicely and politely. We got an upgrade into a bigger room which has got all amenities for free. the room was very nice, modern colours and it felt like you are in your own living room. the bed had feather/goose blanket and cousins and we slept like babies. very quite room indeed. from that location you reach all attractions by metro. the train, metrosystem works perfectly well and you are cheaper and faster by metro than by taxi!Exec summary:- top service- top location- top roomsA place you must book.Best regardsPeter S.

960,We stayed here for 6 nights. Location couldn’t be better-2blocks off the main Ginza street and many restaurants/fast food places in the area. The subway is right next door and the access is also through the hotel. The front desk personnel are exceptionally helpful and personable. The only complaint I have is that the breakfast-which is not included in the room rate-is very sparse especially re fresh fruit.

961,"Here for two nights pre-cruise and this was a great location. The hotel is clean, modern and very quiet. We were on the fifth floor and had no noise pollution either from neighbours or outside.The hotel is easy to get to, surrounded by many subway stations. Our first time in japan and we took the subway, getting here easily after a short walk from the station. As others have indicated, there’s a McDonald’s in the same block and lots of stores like 7-11, Starbucks and high end retail nearby.We particularly enjoyed going into the ‘Food Stage’ level of the Matsuya department store a black away, where there was fantastic fresh food on sale and many taste tests available.We had booked a privilege room, and I am not sure if it was because of this, or is a standard feature here, bu we greatly appreciate the extra benefit of having a smart phone in our room that we could take with us on our travels and use to make free local and international calls. We were also delighted when we got an early check in — our room was ready on arrival at 11am.It is worth noting that this hotel does not do lunch, dinner or room service. This was not a problem for us as there were so many great food options nearby. We would definitively stay here again when visiting Tokyo.","April 26, 2019","18    Mercure Tokyo Ginza

962,"The hotel is very modern and centrally located in Ginza. What i like about this hotel is its location. Very short walk going to the many shops and malls in Ginza. Very accessible, basement of the hotel is the local train station. About 15min walk to the main JR Tokyo Station. Hotel has its own restaurant but a little more expensive. If you are feeling a little trifty, there's a McDonald's store and a number of convenience stores (Lawson, Family Mart, 7Eleven) just right across the corner. There are also numerous restaurants offering local fare, e.g. ramen, tonkatsu, sashimi near the vicinity of the hotel.The rooms are very clean and the staffs are very helpful. Wifi is complimentary. We utilised our membership points so we were upgraded to a grand room on the 12th floor. We booked a total of 3 rooms since we were 3 families. Other 2 rooms were only standard rooms. The Grand room was good for family of 5pax, we were 3 adults and 2 kids aged 13 and 8. Snacks and beverages on the minibar were all complimentary. Coffee maker and tea pot were also available. My only comment is about the bathroom. It was quite small and the shower/ bath tub area on the room that we stayed in has no curtain so we were careful in taking a shower to prevent water spilling on to the bathroom floor. We stayed at Rm 1216. On our last night, we transfered to a standard room. It can only accomodate 4 pax. One of our kids joined their grandparents on another room. The room has the same size of bathroom. There was a shower curtain on the bathtub area. However, one of the cabinet door was off it's hinges and had tendency to fall off. We never bothered to call guest services and just left it as it was. Overall, the hotel was nice. Only recommendation i can give is to improve on their quality control to correct minor defects.","April 25, 2019","18    Mercure Tokyo Ginza

963,"The Mercure was booked by our travel agent and was a good choice. In Ginza, a bustling area with restaurants, shopping and direct access to a metro line in the basement of the hotel, we felt part of Tokyo. There's a convenience store at the end of the street, and a McDonalds and Starbucks as well. The room we were in was on the third floor, small and perfectly formed, but a little dreary in terms of natural light because of the building opposite. It had everything we needed - except for power points near the bed and enough power points in accessible locations. We ended up charging devices in the bathroom because they were the easiest power points to get to. I appreciated having the kettle in the room so I can make tea. Check in staff are excellent - truly some of the best I have interacted with over the many years I've been staying in hotels - and they go above and beyond what is normally expected of reception staff. The bar and dining area could do with a refit and I noted that only breakfast will be served in the restaurant after 30 April. Breakfast is the standard hotel buffet fare, but it's enough and it's good. The bar area does need a little work to more it more 'cosy' and comfortable though.All in all, a good stay, no problems and very good service.","April 17, 2019","18    Mercure Tokyo Ginza

964,"Although the rooms are perfectly adequate, the location is ideal, and we are generally fans of Accor hotels, this one had such terrible service (cigarette smoke in the room; extremely food receptionist: chaos in the lobby) and was so disorganized (mistake in status so that we did not receive benefits until later after we pointed this out) that we cannot recommend. We arrived at the hotel on Friday evening and were greeted by a scene of extreme chaos at check in. When we were finally given the keys to our room, we were shocked to find that it reeked of cigarette smoke. We called reception to request a new room. To this request, we were asked, “Have you used the bed? Don’t mess up the sheets!”Perhaps so they can foist the room on the next guest without another cleaning, despite the excessive cigarette smoke? You have all been warnedRudeness aside, the hotel is chaotic. There is no priority check in, and seemingly no order in which customers are served. The hotel had also mistaken our Accor status number so that we did not receive the benefits (drinks, room upgrade) until later in the stay. Check out was not much better, with only a single receptionist working at 10:45.While we appreciated the status conferred room upgrade halfway through our stay, the room did not become available until late afternoon so that we were left without a room during the day of the upgrade. When we checked in with the receptionist at 3:30, we were told that the room had not yet been cleaned.","April 15, 2019","18    Mercure Tokyo Ginza

967,"It’s a small, modern hotel right next door to designer labels and flagship stores. There’s an underground connection leading to a couple subway stations. So, very convenient for shopping and getting around.Tokyo JR station is a bit farther – about 15-20 min by walk from Marunouchi South exit 八重洲南口. (It’s actually closer, ~10 min, via Exit 2 of Keiyu Line 京葉線but you’ll have to walk up 3 floors) – manageable as we didn’t have a lot of luggage but still less than ideal. The airport bus station at Ginza is closer (~7 min by walk), and it’s cheaper (1,000 yen versus well over 3,000 yen of Narita Express). So, we took the bus when we left for the airport.The room itself is also small but well-appointed – there’s even a smart phone available for our use in town (with free wi-fi and calls!)Overall, our stay there was satisfactory.

We ate at Kushiyaki Bistro Fukumimi one night, it was fantastic and only a few hundred meters from the hotel. The staff were very helpful in booking restaurants, suggesting places to visit and were generally polite and courteous. There is no dining facilities after breakfast, but step out of the hotel and you don’t have to go far to find somewhere to eat. There is a bar, which opens from 3pm. Special mention to the breakfast staff who were all really welcoming and friendly; we found the breakfast to have a good selection of options and which were replenished frequently (the hotel was very busy when we stayed last weekend).

969,"First of all, the location is great - it's very central and the hotel is surrounded by shops, restaurants and subway stations on various lines. The Kabukiza is within walking distance as well.The provided smartphone makes exploring a breeze - it really is becoming an essential part of any hotel's offerings. Early and late checkouts are handy and not terribly expensive (well, compared to how much you have to pay for a room that has enough space for two suitcases lol). The wifi is very fast.It would have been nice to be able to get room service or eat dinner in an on-site restaurant. This hotel does not offer either of those options. I can accept that, but they leave paperwork (the usual ""hotel information"") in the rooms that vaguely says the restaurant will remain open until May, but they don't specify that they mean May 2018!They still do breakfast but it's fairly ordinary. Go to the nearby 7/11 instead - you'll save a lot of money (and their food is surprisingly good).","April 1, 2019","18    Mercure Tokyo Ginza

970,"The best part about Mercure Ginza is its location. The hotel sits on top of the Ginza-Itchocme metro line (Just need to press B1 and you’re at the station). It is in a quiet spot that faces an office building, but just walk three minutes down the street and you are in the heart of the Ginza shopping district (Look for the LV store and turn in). And there are a 24-hour MacDonald’s and Lawson a minute away.However, be prepared that most of the rooms do not have much of a view (they face an office building so you can peek into the cubicles of office workers ) and there isn't a pool or onsen facilities. However, the hotel’s facilities are a winner. The lobby is designer chic and cozy. I stayed in a twin room that came with ample room - there was even a comfy armchair with leg rest and a fashionable overhanging lamp. The toilet’s bathtub is spacious by Tokyo’s standards and I like the overall design from the lift lobby. The bed rest also has a classy chic design, something that you don’t usually associate with budget business hotels My stay also came with breakfast that I looked forward to waking up to. Expect a mix of local and Japanese food, such as pasta, karaage, scrambled eggs and lotus root, with a wide variety of drinks.

Everything is new, shiny and clean. Common areas as reception and aisles are beautifully decorated, and very modern. Modernity does not mean poor taste or coldness. I really liked it. Rooms are impeccable, with new furniture and nice amenities. I was even given a cell-phone with 4G connectivity to use during my stay!!I want to thank all the staff for their kindness. The employees at the reception and the waiters at the bar were awesome. Breakfast is very good, I recommend paying for it. You’ll find all the western options and some local flavors as well.I stayed for 17 nights; a very long stay and was assigned room 1008. During a stay that long it would be easy to have any sort of issue, but in this case my stay has been so great!! People make a great contribution to a client experience, and in this case I have nothing to complain about.In terms of location, it is very good!! Just a couple of blocks from the Ginza Avenue, just a few blocks from the Wako building (use it as a reference) The metro line Yurakucho, at the Ginza-itchome station, in the exit 11 has a direct entrance to the Hotel, it is convenient and useful, especially in bad weather.I loved this city and I want to get back.

IE the dining area turns in to a bar at night but they do serve breakfast in the AM. the PM staff said no restaurant Bar only....There were other issues too.

Staff were nice and helpful (they even offered us a drink after the restaurant had closed, as there was no bar), but that's the best aspect. The carpark was too small for our car, so we had to park somewhere offsite (a 10-`15 min walk away), and the hotel was undergoing renovations, which was a pain. Lifts were very slow and dirty, and the rooms seemed from an age gone by, so I'm not sure what was being renovated. Certainly not my floor! The room was tiny, and was oddly laid out, but in a bad way. There were odd nooks and areas that weren't much use, and not a lot of space to put my things, and certainly barely any space to work. The window was also tiny! Furnishings were okay ,and at least the room was clean. I'm not sure I'd stay again...","November 24, 2018","18    Mercure Tokyo Ginza

Taxis easy to get on the neighbouring streets and connivence stores, fast food, coffee shops and speciality stores nearby too. Rooms were very modern but very small. Tokyo hotel rooms are obviously small as space as a premium but we had a cot in our room too which was a struggle! Bathroom was a bit dated but find. Make sure you pack light and for those of you who like to spread out- might not be for you as very tight. We were able to check in early which was fabulous.

The hotel has a convenient location to different subway lines, and a passage to the Ginza-Itchome station on the Yurakucho lines is accessible directly from the hotel basement, however you have to walk perhaps 400 meters. You can also easily reach the Higashi-Ginza station on the Hibiya line and Ginza station where you will find the Ginza, Hibiya and Marunouchi lines, by foot. The breakfast is OK, but a bit strange, like they can't decide if it should be a japanese or western style but the coffee was great.

992,My third visit to this hotel. Nearly all I wrote in my previous review still stands except the minibar is no longer stocked and the entrance area and reception have been overhauled. The major plus on this visit was the outstandingly helpful Yumi on reception who went to great lengths to ensure we found tickets for the recent Australia/New Zealand rugby match. Certainly way and beyond service and thank you again.The one disappointment was the poor directions given to get to Haneda Airport via subway. Yes it is on the Toei Asakusa (red) line from Higashi Ginza station (not Asakusa station as one member of reception insisted (I knew she was wrong because we visited the shrine and station of the same name). The two important pieces of information that were omitted were that the two Higashi Ginza platforms can only be reached above ground. We had to climb back up a long flight of stairs with our suitcases and cross the busy main road to access the correct platform. The second important piece of information is to look for the train with Haneda on the headboard as not all trains go to that airport.,"November 1, 2018","18    Mercure Tokyo Ginza

993,"Stayed here two nights after a cruise. The location is terrific, just two blocks off the main shopping street of the Ginza. They were just finishing renovations so the lobby was closed off. However, all rooms were finished and noise was not an issue at all. Check in was easy and they held our bags for us until check in time. The staff was quite friendly and helpful. The room was exactly as you would expect in Japan--small, expensive (about $300 per night) but certainly more than adequate. We choose to have our suitcases on the floor since there was really no other place for them. There is a room safe, refrigerator, TV, nice sized bath including a super duper toilet with all the Japanese gadgets. But nicest of all, the room had a free smart phone that you could take with you while you toured the city. It also offered completely free calls to various countries including the US. It was a terrific touch especially since our older version phones did not work on the Japanese cell phone frequencies. We made sure to opt for the room package that included breakfast. Breakfast is on the second floor, is buffet style, and includes both Eastern and Western style breakfast items. The coffee was quite tasty out of their large custom coffee machine. We extended our check out by two hours--one they gave us free and one we paid an extra 1000 Yen (about $10). Your bill will also show an additional 400 Yen local tax which most likely was not already figured into your room rate.In terms of airport transportation, here's the deal. To Narita, where most international flights are, would be about $250 by taxi so not a good choice. There is bus service but the stop is not within easy walking distance with luggage. So, have the hotel call a taxi for you (tell them how much luggage you have so they call the right size) and take it to the Tokyo Station Yaesu South Entrance which will cost about 1000 Yen ($10). They can't enter the bus area but can drop you off about 50 yards south. Find bus platform #7 for The Access Narita bus which runs frequently and costs a mere 1000 Yen. They will take your bags and mark which airline you're flying so they unload them at the right stop. We used this on a holiday Monday so our driving time to Narita was a fast 55 minutes. Terminal 2 is where most of the flights are and it has 2 entrance doors so ask which stop is for your airline. American Airlines, for example, uses the first stop which is door 2. Overall between the hotel and the bus, we would definitely do this again.","October 23, 2018","18    Mercure Tokyo Ginza

995,"I stayed here for my business trip from Monday to Friday. I’m a platinum member and consider that this is the by far the worst AccorHotels.1) Check In was way too long. I booked my 5 days trip on the app. The receptionist had to use my credit card three times. Firstly they charged me only for four days. Then they had to use my Visa card again as they forgot to charge me for breakfast. Then they checked and realised I booked five days. The whole process took me 40 minutes.2) forgot to give me vouchers - I went to the Resturant for my breakfast before my big meeting. I went to the Resturant and was asked to present voucher. Needless to say, they never gave me any. I had to do all that after work to get my breakfast vouchers.3) most hotel stamped the validity date of their breakfast vouchers for your entire stay. No, not this hotel. You have to check the day of your voucher. Each voucher is valid on a specific date. On my second day, I used my fifth day voucher. The second Day voucher expired on my last day!

1001,"Pros - The really nice thing about First Cabin is the rooms are very clean and nicely laid out. I upgraded to the cabin style rooms rather than the capsules. The lobby downstairs is also very nice with a fully stocked bar and snacks. The staff are very friendly and helpful and truly cater to travellers. The washrooms are also very decent and clean. This place feels very peaceful and the noise is kept to a minimum (during the day…)Cons - The beds are not very comfortable, likely some of the hardest matts I’ve ever slept on. Despite daytime noise levels the evening can be quite bothersome with an inconsiderate neighbour (which I had). The shower and vanity area is only cleaned once per day so I found supplies and clean showers a bit worse than expected in the mornings vs the evenings.Summary - First cabin is a great place to stay if you’re familiar with the capsule hotel experience. lf not, understand that you’re at the mercy of the schedule of others that are staying there. Think of it like sleeping on an airplane and have your ear plugs, eye masks and other sleep aids handy.","May 24, 2019","19    First Cabin Tsukiji

They would slam they're doors shut, they would move about loudly which is not very considerate. And especially the snoring of one neighbour, it could be heard throughout the whole floor, which was ridiculous. If you're a snorer please do not book yourself in a capsule hotel, it's mean and frankly irritating. Overall the room size in first class was great, plenty of rooms for movement, but if you're looking for something that's more quieter and serene, business class is for you and plus it's cheaper.","April 15, 2018","19    First Cabin Tsukiji

At the ground-floor lounge, there's a microwave oven and hot water. No refrigerator is available. As with most areas in Tokyo, there is no shortage of food options or convenience stores. Transport options were good, there was a direct bus to Tokyo Big Sight a short walk away. From Narita or Haneda, catch the Keisei service that uses the Toei Asakusa line. Only two coin-operated washing machines, which meant that I had to queue.

1012,"We stayed here on our last night in Japan and it is a very clean modern capsule hotel. The sleeping space was not as small as I expected, and I could still stand on my bed and not hit my head on the ceiling. There are some quirks about storing your stuff due to the limited space, but it wasn't anything that bothered me too greatly.One thing to watch out for foreigners: For the women bath area, there is only one private shower. With about 2-3 floors dedicated for women, that could mean a long wait for the private shower room. The only other option is the Japanese communal bath, which can be quite a culture shock for some since it is bathing with the other female hotel guests. I saw another guest being surprised about it and she ended up waiting for quite a while to use the private shower since she was uncomfortable about the concept.Each ""cabin"" can only be closed by a curtain, so it does not block sounds from people walking through the hallway. If you're a light sleeper, this setup will not work for you. If you do end up staying here, try to request for a space as far away from the floor entrance as possible.Overall, if you're looking for an affordable stay or just want to try out the novelty of a capsule hotel, this is a good place to go.

1015,The staff were nice and helpful and the onsen had more privacy than most in Japan apart from that I wouldn't stay here again. The washing machine was poor I had to put my clothes to dry on a one hour cycle 4 times and still weren't dry. My neighbor got in at 2am and started unpacking her suitcase. The bed felt very hard and had about 2 hours sleep. When I did complain no one understood it's fair enough there's a language barrier but no one tried to resolve my issues. Im glad I didn't pay anymore than I did. ,"April 28, 2017","19    First Cabin Tsukiji

1018,The hotel is very modern and clean. The cabin or capsule is very spacious and comfortable. The bed is just of a good standard single size comfortable enough and indeed i was able to have a good night sleep. The toilet/bathroom was provided with all the toiletries you need and very clean. Hotel location is just in front of a subway or metro station so it is really a good based to go around Tokyo.

1019,"My experience at First Cabin Tsukiji was a good one. I would not recommend it if it is your first time in Tokyo. I would instead recommend the Capsule Hotel in Shinjuku, or anywhere budget friendly in Shinjuku. Shinjuku is a better area to stay for your first Tokyo experience then the Tsukiji area. The Tsukiji area is very quiet, particularly at night, and the area does not cater well to tourists. This is a better hotel for Tokyo business travelers. Some things I liked about First Cabin Tsukiji is the bed and layout of the room. Everything you need, including space for luggage, space for charging, place to hang clothes, and of course traditional Japanese robes and slippers provided. The bathroom was clean and conveniently located near the elevator and all the rooms. It is a quiet, peaceful hotel and fit my needs as I wanted to stay near Tsukiji market for a good price. Some things I didn't like was the temperature of the rooms and halls. It was uncomfortably warm, and there was no way to adjust the temperature in the rooms. Also, the men's shower area was not particularly clean. Especially the sinks and showers. The service at the front desk was not particularly friendly. And the large bar in the front lobby was always empty, with no one behind it to serve drinks. I sat at the bar for a long time, multiple times, waiting for someone to serve drinks, but no one ever came, so I left. The location is not ideal for exploring Tokyo. The nearest subway is Tskiji station on the Tokyo Metro Hibaya line which you have to switch trains to get to many places in Tokyo. Better to walk 10 minutes to Tsukishijo station, which connects to many subway lines in Tokyo. Overall, my stay at First Cabin was fine, and suited my needs, but I wouldn't stay here again. Needs a better location and better service in my opinion. If you are a super budget traveler, and just need a cheap bed in Tokyo, First Cabin Tsukiji will work out fine for you.

1024,"Tokyo was the first stop on my trip to Japan and what better way to kick off my first visit to Japan than a stay in a capsule hotel? After reading positive reviews and factoring in price and location, I settled for the First Cabin Tsukiji for my three nights in Tokyo. I booked a ""Business Class Cabin"" at $45.53 CAD per night. My flight landed midday and with a 17:00 check-in time, I leisurely made my way to the hotel to see if an early check-in would be possible. Unfortunately, an early check-in was not possible but the receptionist offered to put my belongings aside while I explored the city for a bit.The cabin was spacious by my standards, and in comparison to the more traditional sized pods. I managed to sleep comfortably, though the sliding up and down of the neighbouring ""doors"" or blinds can be a bit noisy for the light sleepers. I was given two keys for my belongings; one for a little cupboard in the actual cabin which I was able to fit my backpack into, and one for a padlock/cord for larger items such as my luggage which is to be stored in the hallway of the sleeping quarters. Be sure to bring a lock for your bags if you are not comfortable having your belongings out in the open. Though I did have a lock for my luggage, I did feel safe as a key card is necessary to enter your respective floor.As for the bathrooms, I did not have any issues considering it was all communal. I never had to wait for a sink, toilet, or shower, nor was there ever more than one other person besides me when I had to use the facilities. There is a bar/lounge on the main floor. I am not sure if the main clientele were guest of the hotels or not, but it seemed pretty busy every night when I returned to the hotel. You did have to drop off or pick up your keys every time you left or came back, but this seems to be the norm for capsule hotels. Unlike some places I have read about, you did not have to ""check out"" or make sure you did not leave anything in your room everyday, which was a major plus for me.As mentioned above, I booked this hotel due to its location and proximity to the Tsukiji Fish Market and Tsukiji subway station. It was nice being able to wake up early and walk to the fish market, and then heading back to the hotel for a nap. I would definitely stay here again on a future visit if I were on a budget and I would recommend this hotel for first-time visitors looking for the experience of staying in a capsule. Excellent value for the price I paid and its location to the nearby fish market!","October 29, 2016","19    First Cabin Tsukiji

1025,"'Hotel' is located nerby metro station and famous fish market and kabuka theatre. Cabins (I used buissines one) are clean, you have a locer for some stuff to hide. Bed is quite comfortable. The problem is that you don't have a place for bigger luggage so you have to leave ot outside the cabin (you can attach it to the wall but it works only if you have a locked suitcase.There are 3 showers + 5 open in the barh for 3 floors of cabins. It may be hard to get there sometimes.Noises around early morning which make it hard to sleep.To summarize it is a good place to stay but only for one/two days.","October 26, 2016","19    First Cabin Tsukiji

1026,"I like the hotel with below points:1) very near to metro station (around 2 mins walk to hotel) which has lift so it is good if you have large luggage2) free wifi3) free skin care products (toner, lotion, cleaning oil, cleaning water), hair dryer in lady floor 4) have all supplies you need in cabin (i.e. TV, towels, lockers, pajamas)5) 10 mins walk to fish market information centre - it is only reason for staying in this place as you need to be there at 2am to ensure you get the ticket. (I was the last one in first visitor list which I arrived at 2:15am) 6) has lady floor which is good for safe concern.7) can leave luggage after check out or before check in8) can catch a bit sleep after fish auction before check out timeThe things I don't like as below:1) the curtain is so noisy whenever you move it for in or out - which bothers others and myself2) air circulation is not good once curtain is down3) can't sleep well as there are always sounds around (people in and out, curtain sounds, stuff movement sounds etc)4) receptionists are not helpful in information queries5) check out time is 10am which is earlier than most hotel.6) shower for lady is not in same floor as cabin area (5/F) so it is not convenient if you want to take showers.7) reception didn't wake me up on time as I requested so have to set alarm clock for ensuring you are up on time as you need.","September 18, 2016","19    First Cabin Tsukiji

1029,"First cabin tsukiji was in a great location, literally 1 minute away from tsukiji metro station, about 15-20 minutes walk from Ginza; a large shopping district, 5 minutes from the world famous tsukiji fish market, and 5-10 minute walk from a number of other metro stations that joined with other lines so you were in easy reach of Haneda airport, shinjuku, shibuya and pretty much anywhere within Tokyo.Everything about this place screams efficiency. You can't make noise are use your phones in the sleeping area so you do actually get a great nights sleep despite being in a capsule hotel. There is a key card access to get into the lift, each floor, and cabin sleeping area so you do feel like your things and yourself are incredibly safe.The bathrooms were extremely clean, and there was a shower room and public bath for stayers to use. They had everything you could possibly need including face wash, toner, moisturiser, shampoo, conditioner, body wash, hair brushes, hair dryers and straighteners! You literally don't need to bring anything. The capsule was actually incredibly spacious and I thought they were very comfortable to sleep in. The only thing I could fault was that sleeping in a capsule did get incredibly hot!

1032,"I've stayed in a First Cabin Capsule Hotel in Akihabara, and returning to Japan, I needed another place to stay in order to make it to a music festival happening in Makuhari at the time.After the stay, I can confirm that the First Cabin Capsule Hotels are among some of the best capsule hotels Japan has to offer.A quick trip to Tsukiji via the Metro Subway line, you get out of the station, go up to the street, look around, and you should see a building with the words ""FIRST CABIN"" sticking out from the front of the building, letters going top to bottom.Check in is after 5pm, and requires a room key in order to access the elevators, stairwells, and door to the sleeping pod area.The pods themselves are roomier than you think, even the smallest ones on offer.You get to your designated pod, pull up the shutter, and get acquainted with compact travelling, wishing that this kind of thing existed aboard the airplane you probably arrived in.Each pod has a TV (plug in your headphones to hear the sound), light, and lock box to store your valuables.First Cabin provide shared bathroom facilities (also, male and female floors are seperate), and also provide bathroom products like shampoo, conditioner, body wash, even shaving foam and razors.From my experience, I would recommend Tsukiji First Cabin if you have plans to spend the entire day at a music festival or even at Tokyo Disneyland, and you're looking to save the expense of a hotel by staying at Tsukiji instead of somewhere far more pricey.Great value, even better location right outside Tsukiji Metro subway station. :)","April 12, 2016","19    First Cabin Tsukiji

1034,"From the outside First Cabin Tsukiji looks like first class, but looks can be deceiving. My experience at First Cabin Tsukiji was mixed, but I left the hotel with a sour taste in my mouth.I arrived just after sunset on a Tuesday and was surprised to see just how close to Tsukiji station it is located. During check-in I was shown a booklet in English explaining certain rules, etiquette, etc. Explaining the rules is fine, however the manner in which they were ""explained"" was not particularly friendly. A Japanese lady spent about 5 minutes flipping through the booklet pointing at certain sections, all without muttering a single word, and despite my best efforts at convincing her that I'm able to speak Japanese she was either incapable of working this out or didn't care until right at the very end. Once she had clicked that verbal communication was indeed possible the process suddenly became much easier and slightly more friendly.She then disappeared and a gentleman with average English skill (for Japanese) arrived and, again despite my best effort encouraging him to speak Japanese, began to explain the checkout process in broken English. He informed me that checkout was before 11am and asked when I would like to do so. 11am sounded fine to me.Now, the rooms themselves are great in many ways - very large for a capsule, big bed, lockbox, air conditioning fan control, clean (well, the place is new, so...). The not so good points about the rooms are that they have a very uncomfortable latex bed, lockbox is only for narrow items (it's quite deep and long, but if it's wider than maybe 10cm it won't fit), air conditioning fan control only has 3 settings (very low, low, slightly less low), temperature control isn't available. I'll repeat that last one. Temperature control is NOT available. As it is winter the hotel is heated to 24~26 degrees Celsius, and once you close your curtain the main air flow stops. Couple this with the insubstantial in-room fan and latex mattress at you're in for a very sweaty, sleepless night. I asked if anything could be done and was informed that the floors are set to a temperature and that it can't be changed. Luckily I was only there for two nights, because I would have changed hotels otherwise.I didn't use the bath facilities, however I did have a look and they appeared to be your standard public bath.Finally, it was time to leave. As you might imagine, after two nights of virtually no sleep, getting up in the morning wasn't exactly the easiest thing to do. I had planned to leave by 9am, but seeing as the cleaning staff open the windows during the day to room started to cool down a bit and I was able to sleep for a short while. I jumped up at about half past 10, showered, packed my things, and was downstairs at 10:55am. I was tired, hungry, and grumpy, so hearing ""checkout is at 10am, so we're going to charge you 900 yen for one hours stay"" was not high on my wish list. You may remember from what I wrote earlier that at check-in I was informed that I could check-out before 11am. I informed the lady (probably the friendliest of them all, despite the bad news) that this is not what I was told at check in, and that I wasn't going to pay. She fetched the manager who, with probably the worst English of any of the staff save for the mute check-in girl, told me I must pay because I stayed for one more hour. After attempting to reason with him he must have given up, and in an extremely rude manner said ""OKAY no charge. You don't pay. Goodbye."", turned away and shuffled through some papers. Needless to say I was a tad bit shocked.I've rated this hotel as 2 stars (I would go 1.5, but it's not available) because of its location and the fact that it's new. If you choose to stay here I hope you have a better experience than I did.I really want to like this hotel as it offers all I need in a hotel, but given the experience I had I will not be staying again.","January 5, 2016","19    First Cabin Tsukiji

1035,"If Tokyo's all booked up for the weekend, this really is a good option. Tsukiji is centrally located, and the facilities are generally clean and well-maintained. As you probably can gather, it's a notch up from the common double-decker drunk salary man capsule hotel. You can stand up in your capsule. The ventilation and air conditioning are quite adequate. And the bed, although hard by western standards, really is a bed.However, many of the problems particular to capsule hotels still exist. Although First Cabin has many rules to cut down on the noise - such as a prohibition on cell phone conversation in the sleeping areas - you are often woken up at odd hours by your neighbors pulling up and down their canvas door, zipping and unzipping their luggage, and rustling plastic sacks. In other words, noise isolation is next to nothing. You could wear earplugs, and First Cabin does provide them gratis, but I have to wonder why they just don't use normal doors on these room/capsules. If ventilation is the issue, a swinging door with vents would at least sidestep the noise issues of the current roll-up canvas partition. I would wager that it would provide just a bit more sound isolation as well. Other cons were: the shower rooms were clustered on two floors. This coupled with a single, small elevation ensures morning elevator congestion. There should be showers on every floor.  The shower rooms are not as regularly attended to by cleaning as I think would be optimal. Given that the hotel's business model benefits from an economy of scale by only having to clean 8 showers for about 75 capsules, one would think that some of the realized savings would go back into more frequent cleaning of the shower stalls. And finally, a 5pm check in time is ridiculous. If First Cabin is to charge rates that honestly, aren't that much of a discount from a (perhaps older but still clean) business hotel, it should loosen up a bit. Hotel check in time should be 15:00. Max. Period. ","November 14, 2015","19    First Cabin Tsukiji

There are common bathroom facilities and a traditional japanese soaking pool, along with showers too. In the actual cabin, everything is designed well and conveniently laid out, including a secure storage drawer.My experience was only marred by some miscommunication during the booking. i booked online for a male room and was sent a confirmation of the booking request. However, two days before arrival, they sent me a reconfirmation saying i had booked a room for the female floor. I said that was an error and to have that fixed, but did not get a reply. Upon arrival, I was told that there were no more male rooms at the lower price level and that i'd have to upgrade to the higher price level. Took some explaining that I shouldn't have to pay more for their mistake. Upon conferring with his manager (who seemed to be brushing it off, but i could be wrong), he said he could give me a larger room for no extra charge, but the TV in it wouldn't work.I was fine with that and had a good stay. And I'd stay here again on a future trip.

I loved the location and that they were willing to help waking me up at 3:30 a.m. since I was going to the Tsukiji Market.

1043,"I called the hotel about a week before my arrival to book a room. Most of their staff could not manage phone enquiries in English but they put me through to another colleague who spoke excellent English. My reservation was made efficiently - a confirmation nbr given immediately and no credit card information needed. I took the Access Narita airport bus from Narita airport to Ginza station (1000yen). From there, I took a taxi to the hotel which costs about 900yen. Hotel check-in is strictly at 5pm so if you arrive early, just store your luggage with them and come back later. I booked the first class cabin which offered more space than the standard ones. The bathroom was spotlessly clean and the vanity area comes equipped with everything you need, including a hair straightener. Wifi is good. The area is very safe too. I got out at 3am in the morning to catch the tuna auction and the streets were perfectly safe to walk around for a solo female.","August 21, 2015","19    First Cabin Tsukiji

1047,"I stayed here with my boyfriend as we wanted to experience a capsule – be warned though, there are separate floors for males and females so we didn’t experience the capsule together. The “capsules” are more like very small rooms – there are no cubicles above or below you and you have enough space to stand up. Wifi is availiable on every floor, each capsule is equipped with a TV and the shared bathroom is very clean and all the amenities – toothbrushes, toothpaste, shampoo, conditioner, face wash, moisturizer, body wash, cotton buds, hair dryers, hair straighteners, pajamas and slippers are provided. There is also ample space outside your “capsule” to store suitcases etc and reception will also hold any luggage for you. My two gripes would be that there is only one shower available for all the female guests and that for light sleepers you may be a bit sleep deprived the next day with people continuously coming a going from there capsules. Other than that I felt relatively safe (you need an electronic key to get onto the female floors) and really enjoyed my stay!","July 15, 2015","19    First Cabin Tsukiji

1048,"This is one of the most interesting places you can sleep at while in Tokyo. There are, of course, older, more fascinating capsule hotels there, but First Cabin is newly-open and it offers top notch facilities, excellent service, comfort and everything at the best price. Be advised, however, that if you are travelling as a couple you will have to sleep in different cabins, as cabin hotels usually have separate floors for women and men :) The place is very safe and clean. Choose First Cabin Tsukiji if you wish to visit the Tsukiji fish market and especially the tuna auction (at 4 a.m.) - it's located in the close vicinity of the market and they can help with instructions on how to attend the auction and how to reach the market in 5 minutes walking.","June 30, 2015","19    First Cabin Tsukiji

There is a bar in the lobby serving small plates and flat prices for all wines. Excellent location, directly next door to Exit 2 of the Tsukiji metro station. The amenities are impressive - a 38C whirlpool spa, communal (Japanese) style washing facilities, multiple hot showers & toilets mean never having to wait. Premium Shiseido brand mens toiletries and soaps are provided to all guests, as are slippers and spawear. I could not have made a better choice in Tokyo, and I would return there without hesitation.

Beautiful hand basin area with all face clenser, cleansing oil, cotton pads and buds, slippers, you name it. Blowdryer. Check. Great shower if only one. Shampoo conditioner body soap loofah. Check. The cabins themselves are bigger than I expected. You get towel face towel pajamas (Japanese size of course) toothbrush toothpaste and a loofah. Tissues rubbish bin.

1053,"First Cabin Tsukiji resembles a capsule hotel in that the capsule room is missing a fourth wall and is replaced by a screen door for privacy, except that this place is a step classier. The provided amenities (toweIs, sleepwear, etc) and décor seemed fancier. Also, I was able to fully stand up from my bed. You can't do that at other capsule hotels!This hotel is located conveniently near the Tsukiji station on the Tokyo Metro Hibiya Line. As you might have guessed it from its name, it is in the Tsukiji district of Tokyo's Chuo Ward and within walking distance to the Tsukiji Fish Market, making this a great hotel to stay overnight if you want to catch the early morning tuna auction there. If you’re coming out of Exit 2 from the subway, note that the hotel sign ""FIRST CABIN"" sticking out of the building is reversed. Hopefully they fix this soon.The front desk was located past a restaurant/bar in the back and one had to walk with their luggage past the diners and people at the bar, which I found a bit awkward. I stayed in ""business class,"" which provided a bed that was larger and slightly more comfortable than a regular capsule hotel. There was a narrow lockable drawer on the side where one could put their valuables in and for the larger stuff there was a rack/luggage area nearby. I didn't use the in-room flat screen TV, but it was quite large and the front desk provided headphones upon request as to not bother other guests when it's on. The room was a bit on the warm side, but there was an air-conditioner/fan switch that could be turned on. It didn't drastically change the temperature, but it was better than nothing.If you want a semi-capsule hotel experience, but feel a bit claustrophobic looking at those pictures of traditional capsule rooms, then give this place a try.","April 23, 2015","19    First Cabin Tsukiji

1054,"The cabins are clean and well laid out with all of the amenities you need. We stayed for one night which was probably enough given you are sleeping in such small quarters. The staff were really helpful and the cabins are located less than 10 minutes walk for Tsukiji fish market, and just down the road from the metro. The only negative is that the cabins are REALLY warm - and the air conditioning doesn't really make a difference. Well worth staying if you need a stop-off in central Tokyo.

1065,"So first off, the capsule hotel is really a unique experience. When you first step in it looks really cool, however for myself I wish I’d have left after the first 5 minutes. The capsules seem to amplify the noise by there shape and position, also the fact that they are plastic probably doesn’t help. It honestly felt like staying in a dormitory with 100 roommates. For some reason the floor got really busy around midnight with somebody coming in or leaving every 5 minutes. I’m not sure if it’s the fact that you can hear everything so well or that I was particularly unlucky with my roommates for the night, but at 2 am I had to ask someone to turn to sound of on their phone as they were playing a game. Of course the hotel is not at fault for the behavior of its guests, but it seems to me that they attract certain behavior by allowing 24h check in and by not making the capsules noise proof. Other than the pair of pajamas you get and the capsule itself the hotel offers nothing special, the capsules are not equipped with anything special and the common space has nothing that makes you want to hang out there (which is probably why people are playing games in their pods) breakfast is at a nearby diner. All in all the experience is cool but I’ll definitely never stay at 9h again.O they also give a gift to anyone who shows them they leave a review on TripAdvisor, so expect reviews to be biased.

They also provide towels, tooth brush and soap, shampoo, and conditioner for the shower. The showers are large and private. They're clean too. The sleeping room is dark and quiet. There are no doors on the pods though - only a curtain that comes down to cover your pod door so you have privacy. I suggest bringing ear plugs because sometimes guests bring their large roll on suitcases into the sleeping quarters which can wake you up. There are lockers that you can keep your stuff in though. The pod has a light and plug to charge your phone in it. The bed is very comfortable and the blanket is warm. I think it is a cool experience to stay at a hotel like this and suggest you try it out when in Japan! The front desk staff were friendly and spoke some English.

1073,"My wife and I stayed here for one night more for the experience than for any other reason. The ""hotel"" is extremely clean and well organised and gave a good first impression. On arrival you are issued a card for access to your locker which houses a bag containing pyjamas, slippers, towel, tooth brush and tooth paste (everything you could need). The lockers are massive and easily fit 2 large backpacks with space to spare (This was one of our concerns before arriving). The common room is clean and tidy and has space for you to charge electronics or work on a laptop, it also has a nice view of Shinjuku. From the reception / common area you go down either the male or female lift to get to the segregated sleeping and washing areas. The washing areas have around (and this is a guess) 12 showers and 10 toilets with basins and mirrors down the center, and at no point were there any queues with what looked like a full house. The sleeping area is very space age and looked great in my eyes. The beds are large enough that you can easily sit up and move around and they have charging points a couple of small shelves and a pull down blind. I got a good night's sleep but was awoken early morning by someone nearby having a bad dream and making some strange noises, but other than that it was reasonably quiet to say how many people were in the room together. Overall it was a good experience and at a good price so i would recommend it to anyone who is used to sleeping in hostels / refuges / bunk rooms etc. ","May 18, 2019","20    nine hours Shinjuku-North

1075,"We stayed at 9Hrs Shinjuku for a night just to experience staying at a capsule hotel, and we were not at all disappointed.I understand that this place opened in March 2019 for the business, so quite new and fresh looking. We liked the facilities, including shower, washrooms, big locker place and sleeping pod. The kit provided by 9Hrs was adequate, and the premises clean and tidy. One issue we faced was absence of temperature control for individual pods, which bothered few of us. Location was great, near to train station and convenience stores and restaurants nearby. Staff was very helpful as well. Most helpful thing here was they allowed us to keep our bags after check-out as we were heading for sight-seen before we check-in into another hotel. One peculiar thing to remember is that you don't get access to pods from 10am to 1pm, as its closed for cleaning.Apart from few peculiarities, we enjoyed our experience very much and recommend the place for a night max for families.","April 30, 2019","20    nine hours Shinjuku-North

1077,"Everything is clinically kept in white and it feels a bit like being in a hospital, but the whole place is clean and functional. Male and female dorms are on separate floors, which you reach using different elevators. After your check-in you will first store your luggage in lockers and change into indoor clothes and slippers that you will find there. The capsules are simple but will do as a bed for a night or two. If you stay longer than one night you have to check out in the morning and remove your things from the capsule for cleaning, but you can keep the locker. 9 hours hostels are some of the cheaper accommodation options in Japan and still pretty expensive considering that you share space with around 30 other persons and despite can hear almost every single noise they make. If you have a light sleep, use earplugs!","April 12, 2019","20    nine hours Shinjuku-North

The pods were more spacious than some I've stayed in previously. Modern, spotless, good price, easy to find, 15-20 minute walk to the central Shinjuku area, big lockers for your belongings, and a nice view of the city from the lounge area. I had a very good night's sleep here. One negative point however is that we had to check out every day and leave our luggage at reception, despite being booked in for two nights.","March 26, 2019","20    nine hours Shinjuku-North

1081,"Not only is this an incredibly unique accommodation experience but a genuinely fantastic place to stay! Great location - 2 minute walk from JR station Shin Okubo and about a 10 minute walk from central Shinjuku. The area is known as Korea Town with many great restaurants and shops on your doorstep. It feels like a super authentic area, with hardly any western tourists.The hotel itself is spotless, modern and well designed. Upon check in you’re assigned a capsule number, locker, slippers, pyjamas and towel. If you’re staying multiple days you must check out each day, but don’t worry your capsule and locker stays the same throughout your stay, but you can not access them from 10am-1pm while the staff are cleaning the areas. Showers are on a different floor to your capsule, but they are spacious, clean and fully stocked with toiletries.There’s probably 50+ capsule in each dorm room so expect a bit of noise/snoring. Just remember your earplugs and sleeping mask if you’re a light sleeper.Overall a fantastic stay and I’d recommend it to everyone!","March 8, 2019","20    nine hours Shinjuku-North

The pod is comfy and well heated. The common area is quite pleasant, withoffice space, very well heated too.The whole place, pod and common areas offer good and fast wifi connection.The bathroom, locker room and pods are very clean and well maintained.I could sleep well thanks to my noise canceling headset. My first time I did not have those and did not feel as much rested. The light pollution is not as potent as the noise, but in case it is good to have a mask with you.Overall the place offers a good value option.

1087,"The main reason why I decided to stay in Nine Hours is because I wanted to experience staying in a capsule hotel. Its one of the experiences I wont pass up in Tokyo.The location of this capsule hotel is very central in Tokyo. Its one minute stop from SHinjuku station. As you exit the only exit way from the station to turn right go towards the direction of the railway bridge and on your right you will see 7 eleven. The entrance to the hotel is right after the 7-11 store.You can only use one lift going up to the 8th floor where the reception desk is located. As you enter the 8th floor, the reception desk will e right infront of you .A wall separates the reception desk and the main lobby where there is a long table, individual booths and a viewing deck of a nice view of the Shinjuku area.Once you check in they will give you a black net bag containing two towels, a black slipper, a pajama set and a toothbrush.They will also give you a card where there is a bar code you will swipe in your locker to open the locker. You have to return all that except for the slippers and toothbrush to the reception desk when you check out the next day,Everyone is expected to check out everyday before 10 am.There are no facilities for dining so you can buy food outside and eat it in the lobby. U cannot consume food inside your capsule.There is a separate floor for women (5th and 6th floor) shared showers are on the 7th floor. Each floor has toilets and wash basins.The capsules are actually quite spacious. I am 5'2 and I can sit up properly inside and my feet barely touches the privacy screen that you can put down at night.The hotel is located in Korean town and if you are adventurous enough you can actually walk to Shinjuku main station from the hotel.When I checked in on the first day the receptionist was very nice and friendly but on my second night the girl who checked me in was grumpy and showed her displeasure when I came back to tell her that my locker has another bag inside(they told me I can use the same locker on my second night).If you want to stay in an affordable place and near the tourist area, try to stay in this place. Its worth at least one night stay.","December 18, 2018","20    nine hours Shinjuku-North

1088,"The location is very convenient and easy to find. This being said, it’s north of Shinjuku and more centrally located in Korea town, which was interesting to see, though at night the area dies. Many restaurants and bars were closed by midnight, so if you’re looking to party this won’t be the spot.In terms of the hotel/capsules, this was a great experience! The facilities are clean and orderly. The staff was very friendly and able to communicate in English. The capsules were comfortable and surprisingly spacious. Lastly, and probably the best part, breakfast is included just down the street at Gusto, which is a solid Japanese diner-style spot. Overall, I definitely recommend this spot!","December 16, 2018","20    nine hours Shinjuku-North

You check out at 10:00 am every day, and You re-check in later starting from 13:00. And, between 10:00-13:00, You're allowed only to use the common room.which means: if You're a party animal or a night person, it's not recommended for you to go to this hotel.","December 13, 2018","20    nine hours Shinjuku-North

1092,"I'm currently staying at Nine Hours and wish I had booked another hostel. I have stayed at hostels around tokyo for cheaper and this is the worst hostel I have stayed at by far. The pods have uncomfortable beds and are situated in noisy rooms that echo with sound. Each pod room is cramped with dozens of beds. There are way too many people going in and out at all hours of the night. The pod doors are flimsy and let every sound in. There are also no windows or natural light in the rooms so good luck if you feel claustrophobic. To make matters worse you have to check out and check back in every day of your stay, meaning you have to pack and unpack every single day. This is such a pain and waste of time. And the ONE elevator that takes you to your room is inconvenient and takes forever. Plus the whole hostel is very poorly ventilated and they play obnoxious elevator music everywhere, making it impossible to get work done or find a peaceful place to relax. NEVER AGAIN.

1095,"I had stayed at two Nine Hours branches in the same trip to Tokyo and this was the better one. Both were clean and well-maintained to their usual standards. There were no vending machine or water fountain in the property. But since it's located in Korean town near Shin-Okubo Station it's surrounded by many shops, convenience stores, and restaurants. The property has 3 elevators and only one of them allows access from street level to the 8th floor where the reception and the lounge are. Separate elevators connect to male and female floors from the 8th floor, meaning you have to connect on the 8th floor everytime you return to your pod (room) from outside. Some consider this an inconvenience, some consider this added security. Lockers and restrooms are on the same floor as your pods. My 29"" suitcase was able to fit into the locker which was a huge plus. Towels, toothbrush, pajamas, and slippers were provided. The water pressure of the showers was extremely good. However, the showers were not on the same floor as the pods which I did find inconvenient. The pods were fitted with light switches and a power outlet. It was a little stiff and warm especially after showering. Nobody talked or played music in the sleeping area but I was woken up by other people's alarms in the morning. All in all a very nice experience and I would definitely stay again.","October 2, 2018","20    nine hours Shinjuku-North

The only thing that we disliked was the daily checkout at 10am and re-check-in after 1pm which was really inconvenient as you couldn't access your locker, the bathrooms etc or if you'd had a few drinks the night before you couldn't sleep in if needed.

Everything here was super clean and modern, when you check in they even give you a bag with towels, slippers and pajamas.

If you stay for multiple nights you do have to check out then back in each day however you can keep the locker so you don't have to worry about taking your luggage out.One recommendation would be to take ear plugs, I have stayed in plenty of hostels/share rooms before and never have I shared a room with so many inconsiderate travellers...

1108,"This place is perfect for a one or two nighter stay through Tokyo. Totally Affordable.All you amenities are there. Lockers, Toilets & Sleep Pods are located on different floors to that of your shower rooms and the check-in facilities.You are given a locker like that of a gym change room to put your baggage in.The showers are large, private and clean. You are given a towel, toothbrush and PJs and slippers. You give back the towel and PJs at the end of the visitThe beds are super comfy and a power outlet is provided in your capsule bed to keep your phone or laptop charged. This is a quiet warm room where respect is shown to other fellow sleepers.Only things that need to be considered in this establishment is that the locker key needs to be more of a hard card than a flimsy card that is not waterproof.The elevator situation takes forever to interchange between floors.I will take the opportunity to stay here again as this provided more space than a lot of Air BnBs on offer and it is situated in one of the best areas of Tokyo with everything around.Staff were super helpful and there is a common area where you can recharge and plan your day out in Tokyo.I would rate this place a Big 9 out of 10.","April 20, 2018","20    nine hours Shinjuku-North

1109,I've stayed for 3 nights at this capsule hotel. The capsule was spacious and bigger than I thought. I did not feel cramped or claustrophobic. The staff was fine some of them don't speak english but they have a translator. There's an alarm clock and a power outlet in the capsules. There's a different floor for women. The washrooms and the showers were kept clean. They provide evereything you need for your stay from pyjamas to shavers. The only hasle is that it can be annoying if you forgot something in your locker when you're in your capsule. Keep in mind that this place is only for sleeping there's limited space for anything else but there's a common place with a TV where you can have a seat or have a coffee with a smoking room. There's some convinience stores next to this hotel where you can grab a breakfast. Also be quiet in the caspules.,"June 11, 2019","21    Tokyo Ginza Bay Hotel

My daughter and I had a top & bottom capsule near the door in a room with only 1 bank of about 14 capsules facing some windows (I think they were 401 and 402). They were only about half full and fairly quiet. The bathrooms and showers are beautifully designed and new and clean. They provide pajamas, razors, washcloths, hairbrushes and toothbrushes and there is also nice shampoo, conditioner and body soap in the showers. The capsules are fairly roomy for smaller people and I did not feel claustrophobic. You can leave the screen open a bit for some air.

The experience of sleeping in a capsule is good but the bad part is that you can hear all the noise on the other capsules, in my case a guy left his alarm beeping for 15 minutes while he went to take a shower at 4 am, so if you need a quiet room to sleep this is not your place.You will be provided with a fresh set towels and pijamas everyday, also available free soap, razor blades and toothbrush.Bathrooms/showers are very nice and clean, despite there was quite few people during my stay I never had issues to find one available.Lockers are quite small, bigger bags have to be placed in communal shelfs which make the process of dressing a little bit of a hassle, considering there's only one bench to sit.","May 9, 2018","21    Tokyo Ginza Bay Hotel

The lounge area is spacious and a good spot to hang out instead of being confined to your bed. A couple of small cons - I think I was pretty lucky to have a capsule toward the back of the sleeping area, away from the door. I’m not sure if I’d have had as much of a restful experience if I was closer. Also the cleaning times from 10am to 4pm seems a little excessive. I understand the need for a quick turnaround and appreciate the shove to not lounge in bed all morning, but having all of the shower area off-limits from 10am for most of the day seems a little overkill, maybe a staggered cleaning system would be better so some showers can be used while others are cleaned. Other than that rates are very reasonable, facilities are great (and clean), and the location is amazing for Ginza, Tsukiji and general access to metro links for the rest of Tokyo.

1137,"We were told that a capsule hotel is a must do in Japan and I am glad we chose Ginza Bay Hotel. We didn't want to go too cheap, but nothing too expensive either. This one worked out to be about $50AUD/night.The whole place has a very peaceful atmosphere, and it felt a bit like we were having a bit of a pamper night, with a little bag provided with pyjamas, hairbrush, toothbrush and paste and towels. We didn't even really need to unpack anything out of our suitcases except clothes to change in to the next day! The showers were lovely and warm, with soap, shampoo and conditioner provided. There was a little room with great lighting for applying make-up etc, and hair dryers and straighteners provided. It was a little busy at around 8.30/9am when the other quests are also getting ready for the day.The staff at the front desk were great, and we were able to leave our big suitcases there before check in and after check out which allowed us to explore the city. They can also happily recommend some great places to eat.The hotel is close to the Ginza strip with all the major fashion outlets. It is also an easy walk to the fish markets and Shibashi station. You will not be able to sleep with your husband/wife/girlfriend/boyfriend, as males and females are separated on different floors. But there is a common area where both males and females can hang out. This is one of the cleanest hotels I have stayed in. The only downside is if you are sleeping next to someone who is not very considerate and is noisy opening and closing their capsule doors, and a bit rough getting in and out of them.

1143,"Honestly, I was quite skeptical about staying in a capsule hotel. I had fairly low expectations, but I figured I would try it anyways for the sake of new experiences.However, upon arrival at Tokyo Ginza Bay Hotel, I found myself pleasantly surprised. My stay was absolutely fabulous. The hotel is modern and clean. The capsule experience was fun (as were the many included amenities - which were not provided at any other hostel in Japan). All around, a great capsule experience - I wish I stayed here for more than one night. I think if you are going to try staying in a capsule (or, if you are going to stay in a Tokyo hostel), this is definitely the place to do it.","September 29, 2016","21    Tokyo Ginza Bay Hotel

Ginza is the best place to stay in Tokyo.The place is super clean, everything is in order and even though it is a capsule hotel it is very private and quiet. I highly recommend this place, however i must say that there are 2 things that i wasnt very comfortable with.1. The lights in the room cant be turned off, the capsule has a shed that is translucent. So you will have light during your whole sleep.....if you cant stand this, better choose something else maybe.2. It is hot in the capsules. The only thing available is a fan that i wouldn't call a fan, because i never felt any air. I had to sleep with the shed open - which gave me even more light.LIGHT + NO AIRif you dont like this, dont stay here. ","June 7, 2016","21    Tokyo Ginza Bay Hotel

1146,"I went to all of the BH capsule locations in Tokyo. The Nihombashi location is by far the BEST. The layout is great, with big full-height lockers which are located right next to the sleeping area, laundry machines, showers, and toilets... all TOGETHER. Other locations have half-height lockers and the various facilities are on different floors (sometimes even the toilets and showers are not located together). The beds here are comfortable too. It's a great place to stay, I believe I paid ¥2900 per night.Now for ALL of the locations I can say: They are professionally run and very clean. Most of the people using them seemed to be young Japanese (or other Asian) businessmen and a few tourists. I highly recommend staying here if all you need is a nice place to sleep. They have everything you'd expect at an upper mid-tier hotel: hair dryers in the bathrooms, towels, washcloth, shampoo, conditioner, body soap, etc. All locations seem to have laundry as well, though it is more convenient at some locations compared to others.","April 30, 2016","21    Tokyo Ginza Bay Hotel

1148,"Hello Recently paid a visit to Ginza Bay Hotel in Tokyo. Since it was newly built in July 2015, a few months after, the Hotel is to be found very clean and veryattentive to needs. Also female floor vs. male floor is provided for safe stay. The lockers are a bit small, and had to keep luggage at desk, but besides getting stuffs and packing, it is pretty convenient. Also the better part is its only 2 blocks away from main Ginza area, which is great. Lots of ramun places in the area. And the best part is its connected to one train ride to shimbashi station from Narita Airport. So no transfer has left it a safe ride there and not bad of a ride payment of 1330 yen to the airport. The only thing was to check in after 3pm, yet they will keep bags until your check in so you can walk around the area before check in. The capsule was nice, cuz all i needed was sleep after walking the streets of Tokyo. The only thing was the foreign owner...he was attentive, but a bit creepy in ways too. Very strict, but guess thats what keeps place in shape. Also outside they have a foot bath, that gets drained each night, and refilled in every morning after 10am..which is warm water to wash your feet. Finally i have stayed in many hotels in Tokoy for the past 5 yrs or so, but bc it was newly built recently, it was the cleanest stay i have had vs. all business hotels. I definitely will stay here again when given chance.","December 17, 2015","21    Tokyo Ginza Bay Hotel

1149,"A place for one or two nights. If you want to try an unusual accommodation, this is the place.Rather unfamiliar way to spent a night for people from outside Japan. The philosophy behind a capsule hotel is the japanese way of dealing with things pragmatically : Work, eat, sleep, go back to work...The whole procedure in this capsule hotel is planned to details : Check in after 5pm on 3rd floor and get your capsule card. Take off your shoes and stow in a little locker, get houseshoes. Go on to changing area with bigger lockers. Use locker assigned to your capsule, e.g. capsule 200, locker 200. Inside you find a bag with towels, pyjamas (fits all sizes). Close locker with your own code. Go to your floor. Mens floor 2f without TV, floor 3f with TV, Dont go for floor 3f with TV, unless you speak Japanese because all TV channells are Japanese only. 4f reserved for female only (dont try, otherwise some bodyparts will be cut off (joke)). Try to sleep. Not recommended place if you are a light sleeper. Can become noisy all night, because guests come in, go out all night. Dont get a capsule near to bathroom, shower, toilet etc. Some people dont care, are loud and uses area all night thru. One more important subject : If you are suffering from long jetlag (8-9 hours), you will have a hard time in the capsule, counting minutes and trying to fall a sleep. Check out latest at 10am. Hotel/capsule can not beentered between 10am-5pm. Staying several nights means check in, check out the other day and check in again and so on..All in all a good bargain and good location.","December 4, 2015","21    Tokyo Ginza Bay Hotel

1150,"I stayed four nights here on the ladies' floor, spread out over the beginning and end of my trip. My first two nights were in a capsule that was very far from the door of the room, but my last two nights were in two different capsules that were much closer to the room door. This can have a huge impact on the noise that you hear, as people come in and out of capsules until 2 am and start getting up around 6 am. If you are a light sleeper, ask for a capsule that is further from the door of each capsule room. The capsules themselves are extremely clean and relatively spacious. There are shoe lockers, lockers for you to store you belongings in and limited room to put a larger suitcase in (but you can put it at the front desk if the luggage locker is full). The showers, bathrooms, and powder rooms are bright and clean. I saw a staff member come by every few hours to clean the facilities in the evenings. It can be a bit of a pain to have to check out and check in every day, but basically don't bother unpacking much as they provide you pyjamas and toiletries. It is close to tsukiji, so if you want to catch the tuna auction before it moves, this is a great place to stay and roll out of bed at 2:00 am to guarantee a space at the auction. There is a little restaurant downstairs which is good in a pinch, although there are much better options if you walk around the neighbourhood.","November 2, 2015","21    Tokyo Ginza Bay Hotel

1151,"Stayed for 1 night while in Tokyo, expecting to walk over to Tsujiki fish market in time for the tuna auction. Who'd expected it fills up well before 3am??Still this is a great place to stay. New and modern capsule hotel with amazing facilities. Lockers for your items, individual shower cubicles, coin operated laundry, drinks vending machines, alarm in the capsule, and comfortable capsules. The hotel is within walking distance of Ginza and Higashi-ginza metro stations. The capsule was spacious for me (1.7m at 60kg), and the lower bunk is probably more accessible. Only con, unless you understand Japanese, there probably isn't a need to shell out extra for the TV. Light sleepers would probably want to pick up a pair of ear buds from the counter upon check in ;) Do note that if you stay more than one night, you would have to check out by 10am, then check in again after 5pm, as with most capsule hotels.

It's located close to train stations and there's a really cool market a 2 minute walk away that really thrives on the weekends. The whole environment of the area just feels so unique.The beds and pillows are comfy enough, the bathroom and showers are clean. Unlike other capsules I stayed in, your locker is located in your bed and your luggage gets locked up at the foot of your bed. Which I liked alot, other places have them in a separate room which is just inconvenient. One thing that really sets Enaka apart from other capsules is that you don't have to check out if you're a staying multiple days. Other hotels make you leave at 10am and you can't come back for several hours. Which creates a shower rush in the morning and lots of noise. At Enaka you're free to come and go as you like. The common room is also really awesome. Its a great spot to meet people and hang out at.

1173,"As i planned my trip to be a budget one, ENAKA Hostel was right up the alley. Its relatively cheap and ideal for solo travellers. I stayed for 2 nights and arrived at about past 9PM.The host at the front was prompt yet polite with the rules and whatnot, which is great. Her english is great as well, with barely a hint of an accent so thats an added bonus to non-japanese speaking travellers. You can find the hostel easily; its the 3rd 'hall' when you walk through from the Kaminarimon on the left.The security is also something I like. They have a key for everything and the doors to the female floor requires a special pass. The toilets and bathroom were clean and almost soundproof. The guests were respectable although the smell of alcohol was prominent from some of the women.The wifi signal is strong as well even from the 4th floor. Furthermore, they have a common room where you can chill with other guests and plan your trip for the next day. I am currently sleeping in my capsule and hope this positive review remains as it is until I check out","January 19, 2017","22    Samurai Hostel Asakusa

1175,"I stayed 5 nights in this hostel, staff speak very little english.Not advisable if you need advise from the staff.The bed is spacious with lockers is a plus here.There is no locker for luggage, only a lock to tie on the handle of your luggage which dont think it works at all. People still able to access your luggage easily. Not much space for packing, poor layout except for the bed.There is a rule not to use bathroom after 1am but I don't think it helps or even relevant. There is a wet and dry shower, no shelving to put your clothings. This is design flaws, only the last 2 days basket pop up in the dry area. So either managment made some improvements or other guest had took it for their own use.Clean hostel, but not sufficient bathrooms. I need to Q for 2 days.Only 2 bathrooms for 20+ beds.Toilet always has a foul smell due to non ventilation of the premises.Other room mates just throw their things on the floor, everyday I need to skip over it. The management or cleaner seems dont care about it at all.Their green tea latte is pretty good, from their dispenser on ground floor.Washer cum dryer 500yen.Location: There are a few eateries open till late night/ 24hrs.Many good food in the vincinity, 24hr Don Quijote just 5mins away.Good with metro (ginza line) but not convenient to airport with luggageAlthough it is direct line to Narita airport, the entrance of the asakusa line does not have any elevator at all. 6-7 long flights of stairs is crazy with luggage! They do have another entrance to the staton which is much further away.Overall, Clean hostel except the toilet foul smell.Ok location but hate the stairs to station (airport).But for the price, i will consider twice.","December 14, 2016","22    Samurai Hostel Asakusa

1178,"I stayed at Enaka in May this year when it was still quite a new place. It was such a lovely hostel I wanted to move in. The staff couldn't have been friendlier, the WIFI couldn't have been faster, the rooms couldn't have been cleaner. What can I say? This was such a lovely place to hang out, I just didn't want to even go out and explore (although I did...). The pod capsule beds were unique and fun, each with its own small locker, shelf, a reading lamp, wall outlet and privacy curtain. What more could one want? The toilet room was separate from the shower room and both were plenty spacious with enough toilets and showers for the guests of that room.Each room used key card access, and there was only an elevator to get up to the top floors. The common room downstairs was centered around a large table, with plenty of outlets so people could plug in and be connected to rest of the world. This hostel has a no shoe policy. Please leave them at the door, on the provided rack.The kitchen wasn't very spacious (it is located right next to the large common room table) but enough if you just want to keep food in the fridge or boil some water. There are vending machines for both snacks as well as coffees located on the ground floor in the common space.The location is perfect and right in the heart of the Asakusa area of Tokyo. Supermarkets, the metro lines and some places of interest are only a few minutes walking away.Enjoy your stay -- I certainly did!","October 13, 2016","22    Samurai Hostel Asakusa

1180,"The facilities are all great including coin laundry and bathrooms with everything you could need and more. The staff were all super friendly. Everything was so clean despite it essentially being a hostel. They do free drinks at tea time and free breakfast pastries in the AM which are great added extras. I stayed in the art floor and my pod was super cute and comfortable. And of course the location is great, a 5 minute walk to the train station and all the sights of Shibuya. I feel almost unfair not giving it 4/5 but here is why: 1. It was summer and 32 degrees and the floors have no light and little ventilation. My little pod got INSANELY even with the ‘fan’ which felt more like someone blowing near you. 2. I travelled with a big backpack which needs unpacked an repacked every 2 days and it was very difficult to do this as the floors are all dark and there is no space to spread your stuff 3. Unfortunately for me, a guy on my floor got up at 3am and spewed right in front of my pod, which I had to endure for the rest of the night including leaping over it to get up in the morning. This is of course not the hotels fault and I guess just happens in hostels but I can’t help but feeling the heat on the floor couldn’t have helped the poor guy. It’s basically an upscale hostel and if you’re looking for budget with comfort, good location and a friendly place to meet people then definitely stay here!

Everything was really clean and the staff is super friendly. The common area is cozy and has a nice view. Everyday they have happy hour where you can tap your own beer. As the ‘door’ to your pod is a sheet it is definitely not noise proof, but the floors are carpeted and there is a fan, so I really didn’t hear anyone.

1185,"Positive’s--Super cool concept overall! -The proximity to Shibuya Crossing is great - only three short blocks away -Bathrooms (common use) were always available and very clean. The toilets were electronically controlled and have self-rising lids and seats which were also heated-Showers (common use) were always available and very clean and well stocked with liquid soap and shampoo. Water pressure was very good and hot water plentiful. The showers also feature a small private dressing room which adjoins the shower-Beds and sheets were very comfortable-Fast WiFi -Blackout curtains shielded the actual capsule/sleeping area 24/7-Very spacious common area which also had comfortable chairs and sofas-Friendly staff-I love that each capsule had individual names and have some Tokyo relevanceNegatives--Breakfast was a major disappointment! It’s advertised as ‘breakfast to go”, whatever that means. The reality is that it’s just coffee/tea (which is available 24/7 anyway) and a variety of six sweetbreads. There are no eggs, sausages, juices, fruits, yogurts, butter/jellies, or the like. Major disappointment!-There is no temperature control in your capsule (was a little warm). Your individual capsule has a fan, however-When you recline the bed to the bed position (as oppose to the sofa position), the mattress tends to slide down on the garage door that lowers and gives you privacy. When you try and raise that garage door from within the capsule in the morning, it’s quite difficult because the mattress has slid down and hampers the garage door from easily rising -The clothes dryer took over an hour to dry my clothes, and they still weren’t that dry at that point. Was tired of putting in coins-Very minimal signage from the street - nothing other than “The Millennials” Not a Positive or Negative---You watch a few minute video upon check-in on how everything works -Earlier reviews mention there were noise issues. I was on a mixed (sex) floor and there were no noise issues at all-Mostly younger Westerners stay here-They are very strict on the 10a check-out time - they wanted to charge 1,000 yen ($9 USD) for staying a little extra time","May 9, 2019","23    The Millennials Shibuya

It’s a really short walk to Shibuya Crossing so there are thousands of shops and restaurants nearby as well as the metro station for getting around Tokyo. The rooms are as they look online, the size of a double bed, which are electric so fold up so you can sit up in your ‘room’. The communal spaces are really clean and modern and the whole place feels very new. The free beer between 17:30 and 18:30 is a really nice touch and the breakfast is very welcome too. I’d happily stay again when visiting Tokyo even though you don’t get too much space to yourself, the location easily makes up for it. I even got the Shinkansen to Gala-Yuzawa for a days snowboarding which was awesome.

I was surprised by how quiet it was when I got there, everyone was really mindful. My partner and I had neighbouring pods. I was expecting there to be more floor space and thought the bed would go back more for it to be fully seated - but in fact you only get about a metre.We did have one slight issue where our suitcase was slightly too big to fit underneath the bed, however we managed to get round this by having it fully open. We were only ok with this as I was sleeping on top of the bed and it was just for the one night. Our only other option was to fully lock the suitcase and have it in the corner of the room, or take it down to reception for them to look after which would have been really annoying if we were staying there any longer.Breakfast was ok - some bread/pastries and weak coffee. It is annoying there's only one lift to serve the whole building, I understand that it's beyond the hostel's control but it does mean you can be left waiting for the lift for quite a while if it's going in the wrong direction!On the whole - The hostel and facilities were spotless, and the bed was comfortable.","March 28, 2019","23    The Millennials Shibuya

I saw so many people struggling to work out how to raise those screens, whether from inside or outside the pod. Definitely an issue. I found I was cold in the middle of the night and the shower area was cold too. Probably great in the summer. One night I had a projector pod. Definitely gimmicky. Didn’t work very well.

Their staff is also nice and tries to help with everything. You can borrow anything you need if you are same lazy and forgetful as I am: chargers, electrical adapters, umbrellas, etc. Big plus is also the fact you can make a coffee, tea or hot chocolate free of charge whenever you want to. And as I was travelling because of work I found that very convenient. They use iPods instead of cards or keys, so you can use it for the entrance, for setting up your air-con, light, etc. Location is absolutely perfect, only 3 mins walk from ""the famous"" Shibuya crossing. The only downside was that I arrived in the early morning, so I had to wait for other 8 hours to check-in. The check-in time could be a bit earlier, not from 3pm. All in all I would stay here definitely again.","December 2, 2018","23    The Millennials Shibuya

1205,"Staff:The staff was amazing. They allowed us to store bags both before and after our check-in/check-out. They were extremely friendly and spoke excellent English!Common Facilities: The hotel is extremely modern and clean. There's a common space with free hot drinks and fast WiFi. The toilet lids and seats raise with a button (!)My Accommodations:I stayed in an art capsule on the 5th floor where the walls are adorned with a unique painting. The pod was comfortable and clean. I slept well, but I'm also a heavy sleeper.Considerations:In order to fully enjoy your stay, you'll need to be aware of some realities of the capsule hotel design.1. There is no ability to lock your belongings in the pod beyond a small lock box.2. The only barrier between your pod and the outer walkway is a drop-down screen which does not lock.3. When reclined, your bed will fill up the entire pod space.If you're sensitive to noise, bring ear plugs!My luggage was too thick to fit in the pull-out space under but I could still tuck it under the bed at the front. Just lower the bed slowly to confirm you aren't damaging anything.","November 24, 2018","23    The Millennials Shibuya

But all of that was an exaggeration to me! The iphone is tiny it didn't bother me to hold it and you can leave it at reception if you wanted to, too. The room has an option that you can turn on fan, the night was nice and cool. And the breakfast fun were delicious! Man people be picky.

1212,"I stayed at the Millennials Shibuya for 5 nights, and had a great stay. This is completely different to other capsule hotels - the bed is somewhere between a single and double, and very comfortable. You are given an iphone to control the lighting and air conditioning in your pod, and to control the angle of your bed (it can fold up to be couch-style or laid flat to sleep). I stayed in a pod with a built in projector, which allowed me to chromecast shows onto the screen at the end of my bed. There is a shelf above the bed, USB and power points on the wall, and a pull out drawer under the bed for your luggage.The bathrooms are shared, but are extremely modern and clean. Toiletries were provided, and showers were nicer than any shared bathroom I've experienced before. You're provided with a towel at the beginning of your stay but can grab a new one each day as required.I didn't take advantage of the free breakfast or happy hour beer, but there is a shared kitchen and plenty of seating downstairs for anyone who wants to use it.The best thing about The Millennials is its location - it's incredible! Only a 5-7 minute walk down to Shibuya Crossing and Shibuya Station. There are hundreds of places to eat in the surrounding area, and lots of great shopping. Shibuya Center-gai is just around the corner.This isn't somewhere where everyone hangs out on the room and chats like they might do in a dorm, but it's a really modern, well set up place, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for reasonably priced accommodation in a fantastic location.","October 12, 2018","23    The Millennials Shibuya

1218,"[Positive aspects] Bed is good for better sleep and adequate in space. Lounge is OK since they have tasteful furniture and essential kitchen equipments such as refrigerator, kettle, microwave oven, knives etc. Very close to the central area of Shibuya but also safe and quiet.[Negative aspects] What was the most disappointing thing to me is the price setting. I had to convince myself why I had to pay 8k yen for the last day of my stay for about a week for a tiny personal space without TV. For free breakfast, it means simply bread and coffee/tea but you have to wash and dry your dish and get it back to the shelf. Plus, free beer is available only between 1730 to 1830, too narrow slot. Shower booths are not close to restrooms like they have their doors each separately, which I felt totally inconvenient. Only one elevator is available, so you have to wait for 3 or 5 min at average. To the way to this place from Shibuya sta., you have to climb steep slopes in any way. [Total] All in all, it’s not exceptional enough to pay 8k (for an ordinary weekday, not Friday or weekend) even with some comfortable experience at lounge or bed. I can think of many more points I didn’t like than I wrote here. It’s better to consider if you really think this location is the best for your schedule and if you can compromise with the presented price for your schedule.","September 11, 2018","23    The Millennials Shibuya

1219,"It's my first time to stay at a capsule hotel, and I'm absolutely loving it! I originally booked for 2 nights as a quick stopover hotel in Shibuya/Tokyo before venturing to other parts of the country -- but liked it so much that I extended for 2 more nights, and I'm now booking another 3 nights in Kyoto. The box/bedroom is technically not capsule-shaped, but has the same concept and is actually roomier. There’s a pull down drape for privacy when sleeping, a top shelf for your stuff, a safe, and a pull-out storage space for your luggage. The room comes with an iPod which serves as your digital key and controls the lights, A/C, and converts the bed from a sofa to a lie-down bed. Such a comfy bed too! For us digital nomads, there’s a big coworking area in the lobby and on another open floor, plus a well-equipped kitchen for guest use. They offer complimentary sweet breads for breakfast and free beers on tap during daily happy hour (5:30p-6:30p)I highly recommend it for *solo* travelers visiting Tokyo for 1-3 days -- and just need a cozy, clean, and safe place to sleep. (I‘m staying in the women-only floor.) The shared baths are sparkling clean. My only constructive feedback is stronger wifi (but don’t we always want this!), and to host and facilitate more community events where guests can socialize with each other. I do understand most folks only stay 1 night, and it’s a very transient group.It's an incredible deal in the hot Shibuya district, especially if you book in advance.

And the most amazing part is how the bed functions. It could be a seat and a bed. And, it is really soft. They also offer free iPhone for you to adjust the bed and light easily.Restroom and shower room are super clean and well organized. The big shower room designed for customers to change clothes comfortably. And the restroom has an automatic open lid toilet which amazed me so much.The lounge area and meeting room area are super stylish. It made me feel like I was in a modern trendy Scandinavian hotel.The two things I hope the hotel could improve is the door has no lock and the elevator speed. They use a very thick curtain to cover the room. But I was worried if someone opened my room by accident, there will be nothing to protect myself. Regarding the slow elevator, I truly think the hotel should improve it as soon as possible because there was another customer complained about it too.","August 31, 2018","23    The Millennials Shibuya

1234,"It’s my favourite hostel in Tokyo. i would definitely recommend it and would likely stay again here. LOCATION: Easily accessible from the airport - you can reach it with just 2 trains from Narita. The hostel is just a short walk from Nishairai Station. There is a big supermarket & department Store (AEON) in front of the hostel. There are plenty to of local restaurants and fast food options (McDonads, KFC, Mo’s Burger). There is a family mart & Don Quijote just a short walk from it for your 24 hr needs. It’s easy to take the train to explore Tokyo. Note though that the station closest to it is not part of the JR Pass or Metro day passes. You can use your IC (SUICA) card for it. There is a mall nearby (about a 10 min walk) with a lot of stores including GU, MUJI, Uniqlo, and ABC Mart. ROOMS: if you’re a big group - I would suggest getting the room for 8 with the ensuite bathroom. The dorm rooms are good too. There is enough space in the bed with a small ledge on the side, reading light and outlets. There are lockers inside the rooms big enough for a large backpack. This is helpful so you can unpack some of your stuff so you won’t need to keep opening your bags. BREAKFAST : they serve good simple breakfast - bread, eggs & sausage mostly. You have the option of milk, orange juice or coffee. They also serve unlimited soup. :) STAFF: They have really friendly and helpful staff. It’s one of the friendliest hostel I’ve stayed at. A lot of the staff speak English well so you won’t have any problems. I liked how many activities they had in the week. They usually offer tours or activities during the day and have fun events at night you can join in to interact with the other guests.

1238,"Emblem Hostel was our family's first stay at a hostel and we had a great experience with Emblem. It was very close to the train station, so even though it's a bit far from ""town,"" getting out and doing things in Tokyo was a breeze. The cafe served great food at very reasonable prices -- the burgers at dinner are some of the best burgers we've ever had! It may seem like a little thing, but we learned later at our Kyoto hostel how much we loved it and that was having a vending machine in the hostel lounge. With our time being all out of whack, having that vending machine in the hostel with great coffee options at 3-4AM really made a difference! Staff were all super friendly and helpful and all that we dealt with spoke very good English. We had a ""private"" room that was essentially two sets of bunk beds, although they were more like a capsule hotel. Nice curtains to give you privacy and darkness. Shared bathrooms, but separate for women and men (again, not something we had in Kyoto). Aeon grocery right across the street was also super convenient! Had many meals from there, as well that made this area even more affordable.","May 7, 2019","24    Emblem Hostel Nishiarai

1248,"I’ve had the pleasure of staying at Emblem hostel and I can say with full confindence it it’s the best housing I’ve stayed at in japan - and I have stay in many hostels all over the country of Japan. The location is excellent, the nice quite area of Nishiarai outside of the busy city center - perfect for travelers who prefer to lodge away from the crowded streets of Tokyo. The facilities are top notch - lounge, cafe, bar, laundry and even gym passes. The hostel also sells food, the chicken nuggets and burgers are really good. The staff are incredible. All of the reception staff have traveled to different countries, some have even studied abroad, so they have an excellent understanding of foreign cultures and how many of the guests think and can communicate effectively. Also, they’re are sometimes foreign staff from various countries working in the hostel as well. Ive seen staff from Denmark, Korea, New Zealand, France and Singapore. This hostel is basically an international culture hub. I’ve meet people from all over the world and a good portion of them have come to this hostel multiple times. The hostel doesn’t feel like a hostel - it feels like a community. I recommended my friends to go stay at Emblem and every single one of them have enjoyed it as much as I have. In summary, If you come to Tokyo. Go to Emblem.","February 4, 2019","24    Emblem Hostel Nishiarai

1252,"To my regret, I was at the end of my travels in Japan and was exhausted and this one night stop was to get organised for my next destination. This place has lots to offer in terms of their cafe, food, bar, social meetings and the actual accommodation was excellent. I think it brought together the best of hotels and hostels together in one package. Getting there was easy by train. The check in/out process was easy, fast and painless. The staff were very friendly and spoke very good English. Beds were very comfortable, not too hard not to soft. Ablutions were very clean and of a high quality. The only problems I had were what you may encounter at any hostel but my night was particularly bad with some very rude people talking loudly about 3 am and alarm clocks not being turned off. Perhaps some rules can be made clearer to all guests about Hostel by staff as part of the check in process. However, overall this place is excellent and typical of Japanese attention to detail, cleanliness and high respect of their guests. I will most certainly have an extended stay here next time if I return to Tokyo. ","December 31, 2018","24    Emblem Hostel Nishiarai

1257,"So this has been my first experience in a hostel: at the beginning, I was skeptical and did not expect much, having chosen the lowest-price accomodation available in Tokyo. Me and one of my friends just needed one bed for the last night in Japan the day before the flight from Narita Airport, so we found and booked here two randoms beds.The position is not the best, but allows you to easily catch a train from Nishiarai Station (if I well remember) which is just 200 meters away. If you consider buying the daily Tokyo underground pass, you'll have to pay a fee of 170yen for the first ride in order to get into the pass included station. Speaking about location, the hostel is close to the best supplied supermarket I've found in Japan, with tons of take-away delicacy and an internal bakery.The hostel itself is super clean, with cosy rooms, handy washrooms and cushy common places. The capsule where we spent the night were not claustrophobic, there was enough space for a big guy like my friend. They will provide you a key for your private cabinet (backpack sized, not for a suitcase) and one to access the room. The washrooms have a lot of space, which allows you to easily bring your clean clothes with you avoiding to run through the hallway wearing the bathrobe.The check-in was fast and easy, having reserved via booking.com we just needed to provide our passports, pay and we were ready to get some rest. One appreciable thing: all the different guys and girls we met at the reception were extraordinarily kind, we really appreciated it.Definitively I'll check beds availability here next time I'll go to Tokyo, probably for more than one night!","December 2, 2018","24    Emblem Hostel Nishiarai

Staff provides daily activities and events that are fun and educate you about Japanese culture. They provide bike rentals as well so you could bike around the hostel area which is so worth it. About a 30min metro ride to Ueno station with Tokyo metro line, can get you to Shibuya in 50min.

They hold events almost every other day to get you involved in the culture or explore Tokyo and local Nishiarai. They also have created a perfect atmosphere to meet other travelers and locals. Every day I explored/partied with a group and we all became great friends at the end of the day. Their location in Tokyo is perfect. The train station, supermarket, several local restaurants, and even a gym are all next to, or right across the street from the hostel, which is super convienent. They are a little far from downtown Tokyo, but the train station has an express train that goes straight to Shibuya so you don’t have to worry about transferring at all. I miss the staff so much.

No kettle in the room but this wasn't a problem as there is a great kitchen/ sitting area on the second floor where you can chat whilst preparing food from the very cheap Aeon supermarket across the road. Great laundry on that floor as well.Great bar and restaurant - not much for us awkward vegans though. I am sure a vegan version of a burger or burrito would be a great addition to the menu.Had a great time being dressed as a Geisha - many thanks to the very lovely Suzuki Sensei for that.

All their amenities are great, the cheap laundry was very helpful. The space itself is spacious and bright, something that I felt was a competitive advantage over the other hostels I was considering. Their dining space doubles as a cafe where locals frequent, and they also involve locals in their social events which is great for cultural immersion. The beds were comfortable and clean, I didn't wake up with half my body frozen which is the usual expectation of a hostel. This was definitely at a hostel price with a hotel vibe. They also let us leave our bags there while we went out into the city since we had a late flight which made everything much more convenient.

1273,"Everything I do is quite impulsive, and so was booking this hostel. When I saw the location, Nishiarai, I was sort of afraid I would be to far away from everything. But the local-tourist culture the hostel offers turned out to be so much fun, that this area worked offered way more than the average Tokyo place. A fantastic Korean lady gave all of us an authentic local tour, a real eye-opener! Also the live music created a super chill vibe! Most of all, I should really thank Ryoko! I fired question after question and she ended up helping me plan my entire trip in Hokkaido. Thanks guys, keep on rolling!","August 19, 2018","24    Emblem Hostel Nishiarai

It is on the outskirts of Tokyo but once you get the hang of the train lines it's super convenient that it's right next to the station!!! The staff was amazing!! So friendly!!!! Suupperrr chill but also really professional. They have everything sorted with a hug map on the wall that tells you everything locally and have no problem telling you what to do around Tokyo!

Convenience stores and mall/s in every direction plus food places, whatever budget you have you won’t go hungry here.Super fast internet, super friendly staff too. They gave me a discount for extending my stay. With the option of having free breakfast, bike rental, or gym time.It may be a bit far from Tokyo proper, but with the train station less than a minute’s walk away the distance is not an inconvenience at all.Even the other guests are friendly, from every corner of the globe.

1282,We stayed in Emblem hostel for 6 nights. Staff was absolutely fantastic. Our room was nice and clean but It had an emergency light impossible to turn off even at night which was very annoying. Hostel was clean but It could Have been better. Paper towels by the sink would do wonders. Otherwise there were hair and lots of water all the time. Also the smell was not nice Especially in corridors. It felt like No one has opened a window in weeks. As the breakfast was rather poor we decided to do grocery shopping in the store next door and Have It in the Kitchen/common room. It lacks few basic items like toaster Or table So having breakfast was uncomfortable. There is only one fridge and There are loads of people staying in Emblem hostel. Our stay was rather pleasant but with such good reviews i expected more. Right before our stay in Tokio we Stayed at hostel in Kyoto which was absolutely fantastic and I cant compare Emblem hostel to the one in Kyoto. Many people complain about the location. You know What You get. It is Good value for money. 40-60min from Shibuya Or Shinjuku but very close to subway station which is a great asset.,"June 14, 2018","24    Emblem Hostel Nishiarai

Everybody is extremely friendly and helpful, gym is just next door which is convenient and even the distance to the main points isn’t an issue as the metro station is 1min walking and the connections are super efficient. The only thing this hostel needs to improve is definitely the variety in the cafeteria. The burgers are super delicious but definitely they must have more variety with different stuff and also they don’t serve anything between 9:30-11:30 (including coffee). In a hostel people wake up a bit later (not on time to make the 9:30 journey) so it would be good to have a coffee anytime. Anyway there is a supermarket nearby.

1288,"This hotel is walkable from Shinjuku station despite how large the station is and its numerous exits.The room was based in the south tower and was spacious with a decent size bathroom which included a shower/bath and the wizz-bang Japanese toilet. Outside the bathroom was a small wash basin and wardrobe which contained the room safe.The bed was large for a double and very comfortable. The room also included a couch and work desk.My room overlooked the Tokyo metropolitan building which is across the street.Location wise, Shinjuku station is a 10 minute walk away and Omoide Yokocho, Kabukicho, and Shinjuku Golden-Gai are close by as well. Restaurant wise, I only ate breakfast at Jurin Restaurant which was predominantly western buffet style restaurant with some Japanese and Asian options. The food was outstanding with a wide variety of hot and cold dishes, pastries, salads and cold cuts of meat. It was surreal one morning when a minor earthquake hit Tokyo (the floating floors dimmed the impact of it). The Main Bar was the only place I experienced a drink at the hotel and the bar staff were exceptional.Location wise, there is plenty of dining options at the hotel or in the local area, plus the joys of Shinjuku are all in a walkable distance (10-20 minutes) depending upon where you want to go to.","July 13, 2019","25    Keio Plaza Hotel Tokyo

1292,"Stayed at Keio Palza Tokyo in June and we enjoyed every moment in this wonderful hotel. The location of Keio hotel is just near to Shinjuku Station. I landed in the evening in Tokyo Narita Airport and took a very simple and easy train Narita Express from Narita airport to Shinjuku Station. In Shinjuku take the west exit and follow the Gouverment Building sign. The easiest way to find Keio Hotel is to look for pillar with “D” letter. When you find D60 in the left is Keio Plaza Hotel.The check in was completely Japanese (very gracious and very fast) and I was pleasantly surprised at the size of the room as I had heard all rooms in Tokyo were very small.The staff are friendly and helpful in every way. The room was bright, well decorated and had some fantastic details, not only the usual toiletries with a large assortment of toiletries (hotel supply an elastic hair band HOW COOL IS THAT) but shoe shining cloths, power adaptors, supply of mineral water every day and a wonderful Japanese toilet with heated seat. I would love one of those at home! Beds and pillows were very comfortable.Very rich breakfast in 2 different styles Japanese and Western style. I tried every day some Japanese cuisines and it is very good. Udon and soup of day are two best thing I have at breakfast. Also the algae are something unusual to eat.One of the amenities in the room is the free use of a smart phone with internet. Phone is located in the room on the desk. There is free Internet on it and Google Map was very helpful in big city of Tokyo. Phone will ask for a departure date and later tell you that it will erase all personal data after date you check out. Everything was in English. Free use of a smart phone is definitely a plus.I would like to thank to all of the staff from Keio for making as an enjoyable stay, and a special thanks to Ayaka Hagi and Shingo Kobori for helping me.Keio Plaza Hotel makes a great landing pad for our first Tokyo visit. I would definitely stay again when I return. Hope to see you soon.美しくありがとう","July 6, 2019","25    Keio Plaza Hotel Tokyo

1293,"We booked a triple room on an Amex platinum discount, having 1 free night for every 3 nights booked. Upon arrival, we were given non-renovated rooms in the old South Tower. Room was old, small, dusty (I couldn't stop sneezing everytime I'm in the room, which was quite abit given I try to sleep 8 hours a night) and dingy. Nothing at all like what I saw on websites and most photos posted by other travellers who got the renovated rooms. Perhaps these are non-promo full price paying guests. Toiletries were also not the Loccitane ones as advertised in many photos. When I enquired, I wasn't given a satisfactory response. The bell girl who was helping me with the enquiries was however pleasant and tried her best to help.Check in time was not at all flexible with many guests waiting in the lobby for 3pm. I was carrying a newborn who was fussy after a 8 hour flight and it was not at all fun standing in a lobby with a screaming baby.At check out, I asked an old gentleman (who looked like the manager of the bell counter) for help with the vending machine to buy bus tickets. He looked at me and ignored me, walking off mumbling... I was shocked. Also, I had to do some repacking and weighing of my luggage (carried away shopping) and was very happy to hassle with the carrying of luggage in and out of behind the counter (with a newborn strapped to me). However when a male white guy came, the old gentleman bell boy manager of some sort very quickly carried the weighing scale out for him unprompted! Goodness... I then sat and observed his behavior to other guests and noted similar trends. Unkind to anything other than white males...Not a hotel id recommend at all.

The wheel of my suitcase was damaged, I asked some help from Information Counter, the western guy just showed me somewhere on a map with a building‘s name but without specify the shop’s name, do you expect your client to carry a big suitcase hanging around the city to find an uncertain place for fixing the suitcase. You need to log in the hotel WiFi every time when you return to hotel!

The hotel was spotless throughout and all staff were extremely smart and so polite and helpful.

Like all other hotels that we stayed in, there were no little milks for Western tea-crema was available but how vile is that? However I did get used to drinking roasted tea as it came-still trying to like green tea!!Breakfast:- There was an extensive choice of either Japanese or Western food, and you could eat in any of 3 restaurants (2 western/Japanese and 1 Japanese). My only complaint which seemed to apply to every hotel that we stayed in on the tour was that the western hot choices (sausage and bacon) were luke warm and we English do like our food hot!!! The hotel has its own bakery and so not surprisingly pastries and bed were extremely good.We thought the location was great-only a short distance from the train station and from restaurants and shops in the City-also very safe to walk about.There were some lovely shops within the hotel and a very handy supermarket on ground level which stops open long hours-perfect for getting food if you've had a long day and need something to munch on or to get a drink.All in all, a really pleasant experience and I would recommend this hotel without hesitation.I cant say if this is a mid range or luxury hotel as the costs were paid for by the tour company.","June 5, 2019","25    Keio Plaza Hotel Tokyo

1307,We stayed for just a couple of nightsand I think it is overly priced. The bathroom fixture has an old design and some black spots are seen in some of its corners. We took a triple sharing room and need to rearrange the furniture to have better mobility around the room and because it was blocking the way to the door. We stayed at this hotel for several times but we were never greeted ‘welcome back.’ Though the staff is very helpful and the location is near Shinjuku station.,"May 31, 2019","25    Keio Plaza Hotel Tokyo

1308,"Let me qualify my review. First, this is the second time I stay at this hotel, 11 years apart. Second, I reserved a Premier Grand room. Shinjuku is the place to stay in Tokyo as it is the center of all activities: subway, restaurants, shops, entertainment, etc. The rooms are big considering it is Tokyo and they are amazing in terms of the use of space. Make sure to open all the drawers in the room as they contain pyjamas, robes, amenities, iron, safe, slippers, etc. The toilet (closet) door as I would call it opens automatically and the toilet/bidet gets ready for use which is great but somehow annoying to anyone else sleeping in the room. The service is impeccable from the time you arrive till you leave. The breakfast at the Club Level is superb and the service very attentive. As for the restaurants, we did not use them as I remember a Kobe beef dinner 11 years before that cost me 250$ per person: still the same price today. You can step just out of the hotel to a horde of restaurants at very reasonable prices.A piece of advice: become a club member (free) """"""""before"""""""""" you reserve. The savings are great.","May 29, 2019","25    Keio Plaza Hotel Tokyo

1309,A previous visit to Tokyo involved staying in two hotels with microscopic bedrooms so it was pleasing to appreciate a decent sized room.Our room (1210) on floor twelve was clean and comfortable with bright colours and a reasonable size bathroom.It is a massive hotel complex so do not expect great personal service but it is only a short walk from the impressive Shinjuku station and there are a myriad of eateries in the vicinity.Breakfast is a very good choice of both Western and Japanese options but it can get very busy so worth arriving early for. We also had a late evening snack in the all day dining restaurant which was also very good.We would certainly stay here again if in this part of Tokyo.,"May 28, 2019","25    Keio Plaza Hotel Tokyo

1310,"We stayed at Keio Plaza Shinjuku in 2015 and 2017 and were quite happy with it. This year (May 2019) we booked the same 33 square meter room in the North tower.Gone were the L'Occitane products. The great mattresses had been replaced with inferior, thin, too-soft mattresses. What used to be the wonderfully fluffy, absorbent towels were now coarse, older towels. The room cleaning this time was also not up to an acceptable standard.This hotel has a great location, with Tochomae Station our ""jumping off point"" for the Tokyo subway system. However, we cannot see ourselves at Keio again for our next holiday in Tokyo. We are at a loss why the huge downturn in quality! The price was the same as prior years, averaging just slightly more than ¥30,000 per night (over our 7 night stay).VERY DISAPPOINTING!","May 26, 2019","25    Keio Plaza Hotel Tokyo

1311,"There are a lot of hotels in Shinjuku. Some people would like to stay closer to JR station, some people would like to stay closer to Kabukicho. My personal choice is making balance between good location and spacious room. So I try Keio Plaza Hote this time. I have to walk about 8-10mins from JR station to the hotel. You can choose to take airport limousine directly to hotel from Haneda or Narita Airport. I booked a larger newly refurbished room as size is 35sqm (it’s quite spacious room in most Tokyo hotels). The room is located at 29/F but the view is not that good as there are quite a lot high rise buildings around (you can see the room view picture I uploaded). The lobby is large and grand but not a modern stylish type. The check in process is smooth. The reception man provided basic smile and information that I needed to know eg the breakfast restaurants, Wi-Fi, checkout time etc. Once entered to the room, the decoration is the same as shown on trip advisor. It’s clean and tidy as most of Tokyo hotels. The room provided bottled water and instant green tea and coffee packs. There is a multi charger for use. The bathroom is good and quite spacious so that you can take a good bath then enjoy self made onsen to relieve your tired body after shopping or walking for a whole day. The toilettes are from L'OCCITANE. The brand is good with refreshing lemon smell but it will not give you bubbly feel after apply on the body (I personally do not prefer this type of shower gel). There is a tiny cube of bath salt provided for bath. Bed and pillow are ok to me and I don’t have any compliant about it. After sleep, the most important is breakfast. My wife is very picky about the hotel’s breakfast. There are 3 restaurants you can choose. One is American style, one is Japanese style and the last one is mixed buffet style. Surely, we choose the western-Japanese buffet breakfast. You may need to queue outside the restaurants for a short while as it’s quite busy. The variety of food is ok, there are 2-3 cold cuts, 2-3 simple cheese, 6-8 types of danish or bread, Japanese rice, udon, miso soap, Japanese fish, omelet, fruits, salad. It’s ok but not surprising. The quality of food is up to standard, not bad but not the best. I need a cup of good coffee but the coffee provide is too acidic and I like coffee which is strong and nutty. May be most of the coffee in Japan is relatively weak and easy. There is swimming pool and gym room in the hotel. But I am busy in shopping and sightseeing, so I really don’t have time to try the gym room for 3 nights stay. Tokyo is big! Shinjuku is the main place to go shopping and eating. If you don’t like shopping, you can choose to stay in other places. I do recommend Keio plaza hotel Shinjuku but please book a larger newly refurbished room.

Breakfasts in a choice of one of four restaurants is outstanding. A well managed but not overly long queue signals weekends.

There are trash cans in the lobby, which make us very difficult to throw any trash sometimes that are laying around the sofa from previous guests.Our first stay was in the South tower for three nights, and I highly prefer the triple room here. It is much spacious and has an extra sink in the powder room. Our second stay here was in the Annex tower, which is an older room, smaller, and not as fresh smell . Actually, it is a twin room, but they added an extra bed. (You see the difference?)What I love about this hotel:1. They provide an extension outlet for charging.2.

I should stay away from this hotel.First of all, the staff is not professional. My family (2 adults and 2 kids) got into the lobby with 4 big pieces of luggage. Interestingly, the staff was just standing there and did nothing. Regarding the service at the check-in counter, what I could feel is that this hotel should NOT be rated 4/5 stars. Cold and work without enthusiasm. All the staff should be trained again. Upon seeing our rooms, I was definitely sure that the hotel should NOT be rated 4/5 stars. The room was dusty and the bathroom was ancient. Buffet breakfast was another disaster. I saw a waiter yelling at another Italian guest and poor and limited variety of food. Eventually, we went to Starbucks in the next day morning. Location is the only selling point for this hotel.

Loved the decor and gowns. My only quibble (and it is with most hotels in Japan) is the terrible waste associated with the bathroom amenities. I was hoping that a modern boutique hotel would also incorporate less wasteful products, such as I see now in many other similar chic hotels. Maybe a thought for the future? Lead the way Wired Hotel, as you do so well in many other areas and perhaps give us some options to ditch those little wasteful bottles! I still have a 5 star rating as I realise that it is also up to us, as travellers, to be involved in making a difference, not just the hotel owners. Oh and what a shame that Trip Advisor asks us to rate a hotel according to whether plastic water bottles are offered in our rooms!But a fabulous stay in every other way and Asakusa is a perfect area to have as a base with so many eating options nearby and the lovely temple and gardens.","June 10, 2019","26    Wired Hotel Asakusa

The location is excellent, within a short walk of the famous Senso-ji temple, which itself is surrounded by dozens of interesting restaurants. On the negative side, we found the leather sling chairs in the room horribly uncomfortable and almost impossible to sit in. This furniture choice looked like an example of putting style above function. The Japanese breakfast served in the hotel’s small restaurant was excellent, but the high cost of a second cup of coffee was a bummer.

1336,"The Hotel was perfectly fine, in a nice area with a nice vibe and very comfortable beds. In saying that, I wouldn’t stay here again. For over $400 aud/ night for the suite room, average isn’t going to cut it. The service we experienced from check in to check out was abrupt and disinterested. Our room wasn’t ready until 4:30pm with no offer to hold bags, or apology for the delay. A 5 minute shower was enough for the drains to flood over soaking the entire bathroom floor and the walls were incredibly thin. It was easy to hear word for word what our neighbour was saying, and you can hear the elevator all night long. After staying in other hotels in Japan, including others in Tokyo, I know there is better quality available for less.","January 3, 2019","26    Wired Hotel Asakusa

The entire experience exceeded all expectations.I can't speak enough of the staff and how friendly and helpful they were. Always happy to discuss fun places to go to, local shopping, and establishments to check out.Our room was 801, standard compact, and my wife and I couldn't have asked for more for the price. Very clean and minimalistic in design and decor and we loved it!The hotel location is literally perfect. Less than 2 km from the sky tree, Ueno Park, and less than 1 km from Senso-ji Temple. And if you're feeling lazy the hotel is situated within the Hisago-dori shopping street as well as the ROX shopping complex 100 meters away. Plus all the small side streets with shops surrounding the area. Oh, and did I mention the small amusement park just down the street (east of the hotel)?Food-wise, the on-site restaurant was great. Plenty of local and ""Western"" food to select from. The staff/chef was very friendly and would take a minute to chat or explain something. The parfaits were amazing, definitely try those if you have a chance!Cannot recommend WIRED Hotel Asakusa enough.

1343,"We stayed two nights here thinking we would explore the north area of Tokyo as we had spent two nights at the start of our trip in Ginza. On balance there is not a lot to see in this area and it can be done in a day. Staying in Ginza or Shibuya is better for getting around as it can take a long time to get from A to B in Tokyo. That said it is close to Senso Ji so you can get there early. The hotel itself is quite young and trendy. We took a double room, so not a typical shared hostel style room. It was a good size and had a terrace but I think overpriced for the area as we paid £165 per night. New and clean though with lots of light. Can’t comment on the shared rooms though. The breakfast is small and simple nothing great. Service one morning was very slow. The staff were quite computer says no in their attitude and not very amenable sometimes, just a reflection of the level of service. After waiting for 40 mins for breakfast, only one egg arrived when I asked for two and they insisted on charging 150 yen extra.... not really good customer service.

The toiletries provided were of a high standard and the showers were nice and hot with great water pressure. Hair dryers and Toto toilets were a bonus (nice warm seat and toilet and bidet combined).

1346,"Stayed here over Christmas 2017. Had an amazing stay. Been to Tokyo twice before and had not stayed in the Asakusa region so gave it a go. Great area that is, yes, somewhat touristy but a good convenient area for getting around. The hotel is fab! We booked a large private room with an AMAZING comfy bed (awkwardly gross slight brag here) I've had the gift of staying at some borderline stupid posh hotels like the Park Hyatt Tokyo and the Shangri-La in London but oh my, the bed at Wired hotel was the best heavenly cloud bed I have ever had he pleasure of sleeping in! We had a balcony over looking the sky tree and the little theme park next door. It was pure Xmas bliss, I will forever remember drinking Sake and taking in the lovely view on Christmas Night! They even left us a little Xmas gifts at our door!The little tombola game at check in was adorable and I was very happy and not at all jealous for the lady before me when won a whole bottle of Sake. This place has a great chilled atmosphere and unique quality that many hotels lack. My only very, very, small grievances is that the room we stayed in (cat statue in the corner, arty words painted on the wall) the bath\shower was awkward as it had no shower curtain so water spewed errrywhere and was hard to get in and out of. Also that the hotel freebies (no tea , coffee etc.) were lacking for what I have previously experienced in Japan. I love me some free earbuds and shower caps! Saying that though, there is a 7 Eleven like, 1 minute away (+_+). Can't wait to stay again!","April 29, 2018","26    Wired Hotel Asakusa

1348,"I was in Tokyo on business for a little less than a week and brought my husband along with me to do some sight seeing while there. While I could have stayed in a more ""central"" location, we were so happy in the end that we chose Asakusa and Wired Hotel. The neighborhood itself is lovely and fairly quiet once you get out of the bustling Sensoji area, which is a very short walk from Wired. The hotel is clean, modern, and impeccably curated - if you've ever stayed in an ACE hotel in the states, its a similar vibe. The concierge was kind and welcoming. We stayed in one of the private rooms and it was very spacious and comfortable. They had great french press coffee in the morning.

1349,"I stayed at The Wired from Feb 27 - March 2, 2018. The hotel truly started my first solo trip on a positive note. FYI, The Wired is an all budget accommodation hotel meaning they have dormitory/hostel style bunk beds to private rooms to penthouses. I chose The Wired off of because of affordability and aesthetic. I really enjoy staying in these warm modern aesthetics hotels (turns out Wired used the same PR/branding as the Ace Hotel.) Before I get to the details, WHAT I LOVED MOST about The Wired Hotel was the young & friendly staff. They all spoke english or were learning. They were all very friendly especially Tomoyo and Kana. I met them one my first day as I was enjoying a drink after checking-in. They gave me great local recommendation. They really made my stay superb; I can't thank them enough!Ok, details! The first night, I stayed in the dormitory style room. Spacious/large closet space. USB hookup next to bed to charge your phone. Bathroom & showers were very clean.The next 2 nights, I stayed in a mini compact room. Again very clean, good for one person, it would be tight for two but its still doable. Location: I didn't find much to do in Asakusa except for Sensoji Temple and theres a Don Quijote (great place for souvenirs) down the street. 10-15 minute way to the subway depending on which line you are taking. Although, I found myself spending more time on the other side of town in Roppongi & Shibuya. I enjoyed being in a quiet area like Asakusa away from all the noise. There was still lots of things happening around the hotel too!It's all about preference but I really liked the comfortable & affordable stay I had at The Wired.","March 16, 2018","26    Wired Hotel Asakusa

We had a small balcony and a lot of light coming in through big windows. The only little complain would be shower which did not have any curtain/glass so it did get wet...Second stay was in their standard room which was to my big surprise very nice sised room, again comfortable bed. The bathroom was not as luxury as in premium room but it did have shower curtain and did a perfect job for such short stay.We felt welcome by the hotel staff which spoke good English, we enjoyed discovering Asakusa neighborhood using their map with some special places to see like shops, cafes, restaurants. As well, we thought room price/quality was very good as Tokyo hotels can be expensive....If you use Haneda airport then it is easy to reach hotel using direct train link.Definately will return to this place for our future trips to NYC","December 12, 2017","26    Wired Hotel Asakusa

This even edged out a 4 star hotel in Ginza, which says a lot.The Wired Hotel is located in Asakusa, right on the steps of a covered shopping strip lined with restaurants and restaurants. It is also a short walk away from the Senjo-Ji shrine, a popular tourist attraction as well as one of the busiest restaurant districts of the area. Accessible by underground on two lines and a mere 10 min walk from either, it is a good option for convenience. The multi-lingual reception staff were friendly and helpful. The lobby was open-concept with the illusion of partitions by way of draped linens. The hotel bar/lounge/restaurant was chic in an understated manner, and hosted late afternoon drinks for guests. Each floor is equipped with a large open-concept kitchen and lounge. The shared washrooms were pristine, as were the rooms. The rooms were quiet and each bunk had heavy drapes to maintain privacy and kept the noise level to a minimum. Each bunk had a more than adequate locker space, and key access for a lock-box was located within the bunks. Temperature controlled rooms made the extreme humidity of September more bearable, and the linens were crisp, the duvet cozy and a fluffy towel was supplied. The wifi was strong and there was never a connection issue.Each floor had room options for mixed, men-only, women-only rooms, all with security key access to each. Washrooms were very clean, counters ample and hairdryers accessible. All in all, if I was not on a tight tour schedule, I would have stayed longer than the 2 days booked.

It really made the end of each day special. The bed is exceptionally comfortable and the quilt is like a comforting cloud. We know that we couldn’t have made a better choice for what we like.

The staff is very international and you get the sense they are just as excited about Tokyo as any first time visitor is - a breath of fresh air. Asakusa is a great place with just the right mix of locals and tourist infrastructure. It’s also worth noting that if you should take advantage of the busses nearby, which get you some very close by neighborhoods of Tokyo in 10-15 minutes rather than always taking the subway. I couldn’t disagree more about previous comments about the hotel map- we definitely loved some of the suggestions we hit from it and found it had some useful info about places we wouldn’t have known about otherwise, we just popped the things we were interested in to our Google Maps list for ease. The lobby restaurant is a great meeting place with a mix of locals and guests with an OUTSTANDING selection of sake and a nearly daily changing of food specials.

1363,"This was my favorite of the five (all nice) hotels I've stayed at in Tokyo. It is brand new (opened on April 1, 2017) so we were a little nervous beforehand as there were no online reviews at the time we booked. The staff are young and super friendly and fun. We stayed in a room with a balcony which had a really nice modern design and was very large by Tokyo standards (they have a range of accommodation, from hostel style shared rooms to high end hotel rooms). The location is excellent, right in the heart of Asakusa and only a couple of minutes from Sensoji temple. There are lots of great places to eat in the neighborhood. We did an excellent one hour tour of the neighborhood with one of the staff, Autumn, which was really interesting and gave us lots of ideas for non-touristy things to do. They have a good restaurant with lots of interesting Japanese food choices. Overall the hotel struck a nice balance between having strong Japanese elements but also being very accessible and welcoming to overseas visitors.

1365,"My dad and I stayed there for 5 days and it was honestly the perfect place. It’s about 5 to 10 min walk to two train station, 5 min walk to a street with a lot of restaurants. Groceries and soft drinks machine are all around the hotel. The staff is amazing very friendly and helpful. The room are spacious and clean, I especially book it for the Japanese style well you are definitely in a Japanese house ! It’s like a family place there’s a fridge a microwave a distributor of soft drinks 24h at your disposition. I thought there was no breakfast but there is with unlimited coffee and tasty toasts. I already miss that place and the peoples over there. If you are looking for a Japanese ambiance where to stay and somewhere quiet but with facilities that’s the right hotel to book ! By the way you can have massages also in your room the hotel has an amazing masseur.","August 27, 2018","27    Family Inn Saiko

1366,"I have just returned from a great five night stay at Family Inn Saiko. This was my first time staying in a more traditional style Japanese hotel and it was incredible. Firstly the staff were so welcoming and hospitable. They assisted with general directions and tips for Tokyo, and also arranged our transport back to Narita Airport. Our room was a standard twin; the size was plenty for two people. The bathroom was roomy and the shower pressure was really strong. The tatami floor and futon bedding was really comfortable, I found it much the same as sleeping on a firmer, western-style mattress. There was also enough room to comfortably fit two large suitcases. The room felt really cozy and like being at home. It was also spotless- the cleanliness of the inn was impeccable. The location was also great. I loved being in a residential area as it made the vacation more authentic. It was also peaceful to come back to quietness after long days of site seeing and crowded places. It was still easy to get to all the sites, and didn’t take long either. There are two stations that are accessible from the hotel; we mainly used Shiinamachi station which took about a ten minute walk. The walk was easy to navigate and the road was flat and quiet. On the way to the station there is a 7/11, some Japanese restaurants and a MOS burger. Overall we had a fantastic stay and would definitely come back again! ","May 23, 2019","27    Family Inn Saiko

1367,"We just returned from Tokyo and were very pleased to have chosen Family Inn. I particularly liked the residential area which was so peaceful after a day out in the frenetic madness of downtown Tokyo. I enjoyed walking home through peaceful streets marvelling at how clean and safe it was. There are small places to eat nearby, but few with English menus. However, one of our best experiences in Japan was when we ate at a local place run by a Grandma/Grandpa team; the chef and waitress looked to be in their 80s (yes - really!) it was so friendly, hysterically funny as we all tried to communicate, the other diners pitching in to help us order (we just pointed to other people’s food) and the food was not only delicious but super cheap.The owners at Family Inn are so helpful, speaking good English and very friendly too. The rooms were comfortable and tea, coffee and toast is available for breakfast.The only reason I didn’t give it 5 stars is that I didn’t realise there was no blind or curtain so I had to buy an eye mask after waking up at 4.45am. Come prepared. I would definitely recommend.","May 10, 2019","27    Family Inn Saiko

1368,"I stayed at Family Inn Saiko with my two sons in early April for 3 nights. My eldest son did the booking, so I wasn't aware of the location until we got there. The Family Inn was about 1km away from the train station and tucked inside the suburban streets. It's a fair bit of walk especially after a day of activities. So keep that in mind when you make the booking. A 7-11 convenience store was located near the station.Staffs were very friendly and checked in was quick and easy. We stayed in a family room with three futons on the floor. Room was considered a bit small and not much walking space once the futons were out. Walking on each other futon was unavoidable. There was just enough space for two medium luggage. The bathroom has a shower cubicle and toilet with heated seat. The amenities were adequate. The are was quiet which was great. Internet was fine.They have a fridge in the kitchen next to the front desk which you could store food there. Instant cup noodles and snacks were available for purchase. Overall, we were happy with the stay except for the distance to the station.","May 9, 2019","27    Family Inn Saiko

1369,"A charming small inn, but I wouldn’t choose it if I wanted to stay in the thick of things and have limited time with me. It is a 13 minutes’ walk away from the nearest station and except for the futons and the tatami mat, did not feel much like a ryokan, which I had mistakenly assumed it to be. The hosts are warm though and the hotel cozy. Breakfast is basic: tea/coffee and toast with butter/jam. The windows have no curtains and the sunlight trickles in early. The residential area in which it is located provides a slice of real Tokyo. I didn’t use the Onsen but understand that’s quite the draw.","April 22, 2019","27    Family Inn Saiko

1370,"Stayed here as a family with elderly parents. While the hotel may not offer full services like major hotels it was very cozy and the staff were very accommodating. The inn is in a local neighborhood, 10-15 minutes walk to the nearest train station. We used the Kannamachi metro most of the time as it was on the Tokyo subway route which accommodated our unlimited metro pass. The walk was quite nice, allowing the opportunity to experience the local lifestyles though the narrow winding roads can get a bit confusing at night when it's not as easily visible. We got slightly lost coming back to the hotel on the first night but got assistance from very friendly locals who led us back to the inn. I really enjoyed the private hot bath located on the 4th floor as an added bonus service the inn offers. The room was spotlessly clean and clean towels along with the 'yukuta' Japanese robe is included for free use. There is toast, water, coffee, and tea offered for a quick breakfast in the shared dining area. If you are looking for a more fulfilling meal, there are several convenience stores nearby to stock up in the inn's shared refrigerator. Overall if you are looking to experience local lifestyle, with some peace and serenity away from the city center in a friendly neighborhood at a reasonable price, Family Inn Saiko is the ideal choice.","April 9, 2019","27    Family Inn Saiko

1371,"We stayed for 5 nights at Family Inn Saiko and really loved it. Our welcome was a cheerful and warm one, we were given the tour of the Inn on arrival and were lucky that we were able to check in a little earlier than expected. All the lovely touches around the Inn make you feel that the family are keen to share their knowledge and their culture - love the Owl theme! Our room was clean, comfortable and quiet and it was so easy to get into central Tokyo within minutes from the Shinnamashi station. It was far better to stay in such a lovely suburb neighbourhood and observe the day to day of the community than be too central and there are some good eating spots in the neighbourhood.We were sad to leave and we must say a big thank you to Yuki who saved us from missing the airport limousine bus pick up when we couldn't get a taxi (on a Friday evening)and very kindly gave us a lift to the Metropolitan Hotel pick up point.

1375,"I went on a round trip to Japan and stayed at quite a few accommodations around Japan, but Family Inn Saiko was by far the best one. As soon as you arrive there you receive a very warm welcome by the incredibly courteous, attentive and helpful staff who also speaks English very well. If you read the other reviews about this Inn you'll notice that almost everyone emphasizes their generous hospitality and I have to say that they absolutely deserve this high praise as everyone at Family Inn Saiko does their utmost to provide their guests a wonderful stay in Tokyo. The Inn is located in a quiet neighborhood next to Ikebukuro and it takes a 10 minutes’ walk to get to the nearby located metro station. Of course this means it takes a little extra time to get to the center of Tokyo, but on the other hand this inn is very affordable and you can enjoy spending the night at a rather quiet and lovely place compared to the bustling city center. The inn offers you everything you need for your stay, I found it especially convenient that there is a washing machine (and drying racks) which you can use for free, as well as the detergent. The room was very clean and tidy, the futon bed surprisingly comfortable and in the morning you could enjoy a simple but tasty breakfast (toast and marmalade) for free.To put it short: I absolutely recommend this place if you are planning to visit Tokyo. They even gave me a beautiful parting gift! :) Next time I visit Tokyo I'll certainly stay at Family Inn Saiko again!","September 27, 2018","27    Family Inn Saiko

The people who run the Inn couldn't have been more helpful with advice and information when we were planning our trips out each day. They were friendly and accessible for the whole of our our stay.There is a small area to have breakfast (coffee, toast and jam) and it's great to meet and socialise with the other guests. There is also facility for storing food and microwave if you need it as well as laundry facilities which is is very useful.I'd recommend this place for location, the comfort it offers and value, as well as its proximity to Ikebukero.

The rooms were traditional (as much as I can guess) Japanese, futons on the tatami mats. we had private bathroom and shower, but they also offered on the top floor a traditional Japanese ryokan bath which you could make an appointment for and you had it all to yourself (no charge). Washing machine was available with soap included and they had a frig which we were welcome to use near the front desk.

1380,"Alright, I made an account just to write this review (as well as a few others from this trip). My wife and I just had our honeymoon in Tokyo for the past two weeks. We weren't originally planning to stay here. We had plans to travel to Osaka, but cancelled them because of the earthquake and chose to stay in Tokyo instead. We had checked out of our hotel in Shinjuku and had to find a new place. As luck would have it, the first place we found was Family Inn Saiko. It had great reviews, so we decided to stay.I have to say that this is a much different experience from a traditional hotel. If you are booking here expecting to stay at a place the Park Hyatt, you will probably be surprised. The rooms are clean, Japanese-style rooms and you sleep on a futon. While your room has a toilet and shower, there is also a Japanese-style bath on the top floor that can be reserved on a per-room basis (I recommend trying it). All of the inn staff are family or friends of family. They are all very nice and welcoming people, and we greatly enjoyed our time here and interacting with them. They were very welcoming and accommodating even on the short notice with which we booked (less than 24 hours in advance). The inn itself is located in a nice, quiet neighborhood about 25 minute walking time from Ikebukuro (or 10 minutes from two nearby train lines, the Fukatoshin subway line and the Seibu-Ikebukuro line. Note that your JR rail pass won't work on either line as they are not owned by JR, but it's also totally reasonable to walk to Ikebukuro and catch the Yamanote line (or another JR line) there. Walking through the neighborhood and exploring the various tiny shops and restaurants was probably one of our favorite moments of the trip. We really felt like we got to experience everyday life in Japan as opposed to being caught in the tourist bubble. I will say that it helps to know a small bit of Japanese when interacting with the locals, but I imagine with the inn in the neighborhood, most people around here are at least used to the occasional tourist popping by. Finally, just another note about the inn staff. The Saiko family is wonderful and really made us feel like we were guests in their home rather than guests at an inn. We have already decided that whenever we come to Tokyo, this is the place we will stay. The value, location, and experience can't be topped. The Saiko family is what makes this place truly special, and I encourage you to stay here and give it a try.","June 26, 2018","27    Family Inn Saiko

1381,"Our small family stayed three nights at the end of May. The inn was easy to find if you followed the directions in the video on the inn's website. We had an enjoyable walk from the train station to the inn. There is actually very little traffic on the small streets, most residents were either walking or biking. The facilities are nice, and the basic breakfast of toast with jams, and coffee or tea was good. They have a collection of small gifts for purchase which was fun, as well as foods suitable for eating in your room if you desire (ramen noodles and the like). But the real reason to stay are the people. Uki and Hiroshi are very friendly, and to say they are helpful is a huge understatement. I lost my wallet on our first day in Tokyo, a city of almost 40 million! I had heard wallets can be returned in Tokyo, so I wasn't in a big hurry to call in my lost credit cards. We went to the local koban (police station) and filled out a report with the help of a couple of friendly officers. The next day we came back from our sightseeing and Uki had called around to the subway stations (of which there are a lot) and found my wallet! Everything was accounted for, even the cash. I can't say enough good things about the folks at Family Inn Saiko, other than they helped make our trip to Japan an incredible experience.","June 26, 2018","27    Family Inn Saiko

1382,"We felt like locals lodging in this quaint family-run inn for 4 nights! Being on a Budget, we walked every day from the train stations (to and from Shiinamachi with luggage, and to and from Kanamecho for the rest) - it was arduous for our two elementary school aged kids, especially when it was drizzly and windy on some occasions, but I guess it taught them to persevere through minor hardships! For adults, the walk is doable and it is really a very pleasant upper-middle class neighbourhood to stroll through.The hospitality is unbeatable, as many have attested to. They have helpful maps to popular destinations (e.g. Tsukiji market) and whoever is manning the front desk always goes the extra mile to help you with any queries. We had a really charming experience being decked out in real kimonos by the Grandma of the family who owns the inn. It was complimentary, and in many ways, a priceless experience and we got to take lovely photos which will make for great memories of our time in Japan.The rooms are small and cosy but has everything that you would need. The rooms do not have blackout curtains and the sun rises around 5am, so do bring eye-shades if the morning light would affect your sleep. Tea and toast provided complimentarily in the mornings are simple but a warm touch that would give you the needed boost to start your day / trek to the train station or first itinerary stop.It is great value for the price and we warmly recommend it.","June 16, 2018","27    Family Inn Saiko

I chose this place because of the reviews and I'm so glad I did. Do not be fooled by the 10-12 min walk from Shiinamachi or Kanamecho station. It really is quiet easy if you follow the directions. The Family Inn is quite charming. My friend and I slept in traditional Japanese styled beds which were very comfortable especially during the summer. During our stay the host gave us recommendations, advice and tips on how to get to around. The kitchen and laundry were great as we needed to wash some of our clothes. Big bonus for us! We felt really welcomed and one of the hosts we bumped into at Shiinamachi station even helped us around and recommended a great place to get some Kit Kats as a souvenir.

1389,"Family of three taking a 5-night trip to Japan. We stayed with the Family Inn Saiko on our first two nights in Tokyo. Not taking a 5-rating lightly, the unbeatable staff made it well deserved. Booking and web site were full of great information, especially for a first-time visitor to Japan. Location was quaint and although a bit of a walk to the nearest two stations (both not JR), a taxi was only 1000 yen tops from the IKEBUKURO station. The facilities themselves are very simple but clean and comfortable. What makes the Family Inn shine are the staff. Extremely warm greeting by english-speaking staff, they understand that many wary travelers are visiting for the first time and suffering not only from exhaustion but a healthy dose of culture shock. Check-in and explanation of the facilities were prompt and clear. When requesting a place for a ""quick bite to eat"", we were not only given a terrific recommendation but he actually walked us to the little restaurant. A quaint little spot named Kamameshi Ran, we had an terrific meal in an intimate setting with full translation provided by our host before he returned to the hotel. It put us at ease in a daunting cultural shift and will be one of our most lasting memories of the visit to Japan. For the next two days, all our questions were expertly answered, and many great recommendations provided. Breakfast is a very simple toast with tea and coffee but a great start to the day.

1393,We had a wonderful six-nights stay. This was our first trip to Tokyo and Family Inn Saiko was a very good choice for us. The staff and owner were friendly and were always ready to make sightseeing suggestions. We were able to relax and had a good night sleep after our busy day of sight seeing. The Inn is about 10 minutes walk from the nearest train station so it was fun to walk through the neighborhood to get to the train station.

The area is calm and in walking distance to most places. If you like walking a bit instead of the trains. Otherwise the nearest train station - Kanamecho (F8/Y8) is 1 km. from here and is run by Tokyo Metrostation. Only 1.5 km to Ikebukuro Station from Kanamecho Station.

1397,"This hotel is in a quiet suburban neighborhood. I requires a 10-15 minute walk to get to one of two nearby metro/subway stations (Kamacheo or Shiinamachi). Both stations are one stop away from Ikebukuro Station which is a major metro/subway/JR station with multiple connecting lines and a large shopping center and district. Shiinamachi Station is nearby a number of local restaurants, shops and grocery stores. The train to/from Narita will get you to Ikebukuro Station either directly or with one train change. Ikebukuro's JR Station also connects directly to most other local/regional destinations. If you take the train to Ikebukuro and have a lot of luggage, take a taxi (about $9) from the taxi rank on the west side of the station. The hotel web site provides all the information you need including a local map and instructions on how to get to the hotel via taxi or train+walking. The hotel includes 13 rooms on two stories (there is an elevator). All rooms have tatami mats rather than beds (and if you find the mats to be hard to sleep on, consult with the staff). You do not wear shoes in the room. There are no chairs in the room -- more reason to get out and about; however there are a couple of tables with benches in the breakfast area. The bathroom is large with a fully outfitted toilet/bidet with heated seat. The shower is also large with great water pressure and lots of hot water.The breakfast is simple, but gets the job done. There is a toaster, thick fresh white bread with jams and peanut butter, tea, coffee and hot water. There is a refrigerator just off the main lobby where you can store whatever you want (for example, we bought fruit plates from the local supermarket to supplement breakfast and kept them in the fridge). The staff is really friendly and helpful (regarding the hotel itself and travel suggestions). We were especially lucky to have the owner, Masa, as our staff person. This was because we stayed over the New Year's period when most locals are on holidays (note that the Imperial Palace and many museums are closed from Dec. 29/30 to Jan. 3/4), including the front desk and cleaning staff at Family Inn Saiko. On New Year's Day, Masa's mother and wife prepared a traditional Japanese breakfast plus gave each of us a couple of small gifts. We really enjoyed this personal, local, cultural experience.","January 8, 2018","27    Family Inn Saiko

1398,"I stayed at Family Inn Saiko for 3 days in December and was extremely happy with my choice. The Inn is located in a quiet neighbourhood in Toshima with reasonable access to Seibu lines and Tokyo Metro. The room was very clean and was moderately sized for Tokyo. However, it must be emphasized that the quick and courteous service and fantastic value for money are the most attractive factors. Furthermore, it was easy to chat with Mr. Masa and the other staff members in English. They are more than capable of giving you an idea of what is around the neighbourhood and providing you with suggestions on what to do.All in all, I would definitely recommend Family Inn Saiko to anyone looking to travel to Tokyo.

1400,"A great time... again! Just like the previous times I visited Tokyo I did choose Family Inn Saiko again this November. And just like the times before it is still my first choice. Very friendly staff who always gives you an advice. Be it todays weather forecast, train connections to your daily destinations around Tokyo or even a reservation in a non English speaking Japanese restaurant. The team is really helpful. I also like the ""just the right size"" rooms which are clean and very quiet. Some guest mentioned the location to be an issue. Yes, it is something to be considered. It is not a place where you step out the door and be in Shibuya nightlife... But if you want to calm down and relax during the night after spending the day in buzzing Tokyo this place should be in your consideration. You can´t beat getting of the train in the evening, have a nice dinner in one of the areal restaurants and slowly take a short walk ""home"" to Family Inn Saiko.","November 29, 2017","27    Family Inn Saiko

The room was a good size (small by Western standards but not dissimilar to other rooms I stayed in in Japan), well laid out, and very clean! The staff were all very welcoming, spoke good English, and were very helpful. While it is not located centrally transport in to central Tokyo is very straight forward and doesn't take long.

1402,"This October, my brothers and I stayed in a triple at the Family Inn Saiko, and it was a fun and memorable experience! We were interested to try a Japanese-style hotel, but were traveling on a bit of a budget. Our stay at this hotel turned out to be the perfect fit - it was very affordable, and we really enjoyed the unique amenities of the hotel. The futons were very comfortable on the tatami floor, and the yukata were a lot of fun to try on. The hotel was also nicely located, about 10-15 minutes' walk from the nearest subway station. The neighboorhood always felt safe to us, even at night. The owner also spoke good English and seemed very personable - he always seemed interested in our travel plans and willing to give us pointers and suggestions. It was nice to know that there was someone we could ask cultural questions if something ever came up.A couple other points: + The hotel helped make our trip from the airport really convenient and simple. On their website, they provide a set of dual-language taxi instructions (part of the PDF travel kit) to get from the west entrance of Ikebukuro Station to the hotel. We were simply able to hail a cab in the taxi lane outside, and show the driver the sheet of instructions. The hotel even reimbursed us for the fare, which was very nice.+ We had planned a day trip to Kyoto, where we checked out Tuesday morning and checked back in Wednesday night. We were allowed to leave most of our luggage at the hotel while we were away, which made our trip much easier to manage.","November 20, 2017","27    Family Inn Saiko

1403,"This quaint inn located in the neighborhood between Kanamechō and Shiinamachi was our most hospitable and unique accommodation yet. Navigating to the inn by foot brings you into a suburb of Tokyo complete with post office, a school, and other shops for a more culturally immersive experience. The inn provides tatami style complete with yukata included in the room. The facilities were clean and organized, bathrooms were spacious, and we very much appreciated the inclusion of laundry with drying racks to take into your room. Lastly, the staff were so helpful and knowledgeble in both navigating us through Tokyo's complex train lines to attractions, but also helped book the means to make it to our airport when it was time to leave. Family Inn Saiko and their staff truly deserve the high praise for the hard work they put into providing the utmost in Japanese hospitality for their guests.

The location is also 10-15 min walk from two train stations so we found it convenient to travel around the city. I love that the hotel is outside of the main tourist area so we got to see places where the locals go.

1407,"With this being my first big trip to a foreign country, I did a a good amount of research in comparing places to stay while in Japan. And like many other individuals, I also found the price, area, and extremely positive reviews attractive. I was not disappointed.I spent 13 nights at the Family Inn Saiko, and it was an excellent experience, and a great addition to my immersion, so to speak, into the Japanese culture. The hotel staff were very nice, friendly, and helpful, and really made it feel like I was at home during my stay. If I had any questions about the area, a particular destination I had planned, or just general questions, they were always happy to assist and clarify.The tatami mats and futons my be a negative aspect for some travelers, but I personally found it quite enjoyable and comfortable, and was able to get plenty of rest during my trip.Access to other parts of Tokyo, and Japan as a whole, is a quick 10-15 walk away: Kanamecho for the Subway, and Shiinamachi for the train (depending on your preference and/or destination). If you want to be close to some of the major areas in and around Tokyo, but not necessarily smack in the middle of a heavily populated area, this is definitely a place to consider.The breakfast is self service and consists of: Toast, jelly (various), peanut butter, tea, and coffee.Summary: It's a great place to stay, the price is extremely fair, it is close to the action but not right in the middle of it, and if you have any questions never be afraid to ask one of the hotel staff. If you're looking for a ""standard"" hotel, keep in mind that the sleeping arrangements may be a little different that what you expect.","October 16, 2017","27    Family Inn Saiko

1412,"Really good ryokan experience here. We stayed in 4 different hotels in our 2 week trip. 2 western style and 2 ryokan. Really liked this one. It's small and in a residential area which gave it a really authentic Japanese vibe. You'll hardly see any other tourists when walking the clean safe streets here - a real plus point! We asked for an extra futon each which was done without fuss and made sleeping really comfortable. 10-15 min walk to 2 local subway stations which will take you anywhere in the city. The owner and his staff are really helpful, friendly and speak good English, although a few words of Japanese really raise an extra smile! They really want to help out with your plans for the day and to make helpful suggestions. Really can't do enough for you and make you feel really at home. On balance, probably the best value for money out of all 4 hotels we stayed with in. Not luxurious, but clean, comfortable and friendly. Everything you really need is here. Big thumbs up.

No problem getting around on the the extensive metro network.Supermarkets, laundrettes, eateries near-by.Would definitely recommend if you want to experience something more than a generic western-style hotel.Breakfast however very underwhelming - white toast and instant coffee.

The rooms were compact but comfortable, four nights in and I could easily do a dozen more. The Metro stations are a quick walk and we'd do them a couple of times a day (recommend CityMapper app) and we went all over - parks, museums, nightlife- it was amazing! We had yakatori right down the road, Japan was playing soccer on TV- what fun (they won!)!! Nothing like seeing folks who were there and waving days later. DON'T miss the tub upstairs (so relaxing!) and the Kimono experience was amazing!!!! We'd return here in a moment- thank you so very much for the wonderful experience!!!!","March 29, 2017","27    Family Inn Saiko

The hospitality and generosity shown by the staff here made me feel more like a visiting family member than a guest. Information was clearly available on using the amenities, such serving yourself unlimited tea or coffee, and booking the private use of the bath upstairs (must do!).A basic breakfast is provided, which is quite adequate. A fridge and microwave is provided in the communal kitchen for other meals if you want. The walk to the accommodation from the station takes about 10-15 mins, but is so interesting with shops and the neighbourhood that it took me always a little longer. Transport to other places is very easy as it is only 1 station to Ikebukuro, a major hub.As a solo female traveller, I felt very safe.

1443,"Just returned from a 2 week family vacation to Japan(1st timers) & spent our 1st 5 nights there. Wanted to experience a traditional Ryokan before moving on to a 5 star type of accommodation. Have to admit it was as good if not better than the more "" glitzy"" hotels we stayed at. Reasons?1). After spending all day in the crowds of Tokyo it was a nice change of pace to walk through the streets of Shiinamachi & experience the quietness of the local neighborhood.2). The Inn is very clean. Rooms are quaint but we were not expecting the roominess of the Hotel Chinzanso where we stayed our last 3 nights and paid 3x's more. 3). The staff there is 2nd to none. Masa-San walked us to a local massage parlor to introduce us to the staff & set- up our appointments. Since we don't speak Japanese it proved to be most helpful. He also introduced us to the local Yakatori BBQ chicken vendor which we frequented quite often to get to know him personally.4). It's a 10 min walk to 2 local train stations that will connect you to the Ikebukuro train station that will get you to anywhere else in Tokyo.5). The area has many good restaurants without the waiting we experienced in the more popular parts of Tokyo.6). We rented a mobile wi-fi router for $5(U.S.)/day for navigational purposes from them & it was valuable.7). Every morning either Hiroshi-San or Masa-San would provide train times & directions to areas we wanted to visit that day & they had all the information there. It was a great time to enjoy they're free breakfast( although only toast, jam, peanut butter, tea & coffee it was sufficient for our needs).8). The hot bath upstairs on the 4th floor was free of charge and could be reserved for private use. The Onsen experience at the end of the day is heavenly.9). The would place the flags of the country where the guests are from staying that day & provided a great conversational piece during breakfast.10). They have a kitchen area where we used utensils when we brought back food to eat there. We filled up our water bottles with their water filtration device. Also used their microwave to nuke our food if it was cold.11). They have a washing machine with detergent to use free of charge but no dryer. If needed there's a laundromat about a 1 minute walk if a dryer was needed.12). They introduced us to a tour guide, Kumi Numata of Yorisow Tours who arranged tours of different parts of Tokyo for us. She was wonderful. Since it was our 1st time to Japan and we don't speak the language we were intimidated to learn the culture & history on our own. I highly recommend her.All in all I don't have any negative thing about this place & would definitely stay here again.","December 31, 2016","27    Family Inn Saiko

1444,"We loved staying in a quieter neighborhood in Tokyo, especially once we figured out that we could take the Seibu line train to a neighborhood stop rather than walk the 30 minutes from the Ikebukuro subway station. The neighborhood had many good restaurants, shops and a great bakery, and gave a less touristy view of Tokyo; few shopkeepers spoke English.

Knowing very little about the layout (and nothing about the feel) of Tokyo prior to arriving, I was initially a little concerned about the location, i.e., whether it would be too far out of the centre of town and/or difficult to find. It turns out that the location is excellent for a couple of reasons: (1) the Shiinamachi area has its own charm and provides a unique experience of Tokyo, something you won't find in the more touristed areas of Tokyo, and (2) it's only one stop from Ikebukuro station, which easily connects you to the rest of Tokyo (and is on the JR Yamanote line). The location map provided by the Inn is detailed and helpful.As for everything else, absolutely wonderful: friendly and helpful staff, an onsite bath, and a clean, comfortable, quiet room. The vibe of the Inn is of a home away from home.So whether you've stayed in Tokyo before, or are new to it like I was, I would highly recommend making your experience a unique and enjoyable one by staying at the Family Inn Saiko.","November 12, 2016","27    Family Inn Saiko

That is saying something... Now this hostel has great potential but it's managed in an absolutely awful way. Dorms are massive and there's no policy about being quiet i.e. I got absolutely no sleep. The pillow was super hard, the beds are made of super thin plywood so there is zero sound-proofing. People come and go without any respect whatsoever. There's a no eat/drinks rule but noone seemed to really care - people were eating, drinking etc. There's a tiny communal kitchen which for the size of the hostel is a joke. Bathrooms are in reasonable condition but they aren't cleaned much so when I went to shower there was hair everywhere, water splattered everywhere, bins looked as if they hadn't been emptied in days - It was nasty. People were even clipping their nails on the dorm floor.... . To top this off, when I checked out within less than 12 hours of check-in noone seemed to care.

1463,"I chose Bunka Hostel because of the suggestion by Booking.com, and it was a good suggestion indeed!Bunka Hostel is strategically located near Tsukuba Express, Ginza Line, and Asakusa Line. From Narita airport, one can take the train directly to Asakusa, and take a long walk, passing by Kaminarimon Gate and shopping streets.Bunka Hostel is also near Don Quijote where you can buy stuff. A cheap bento shop is also near Don Quijote, which is recommended by one of the staff.Asakusa area has lots of places to eat and shop.I'm satisfied with the hostel staff; just the choice of words was a problem. The one who did my payment said ""I don't care"" instead of ""It's up to you [whether you pay in cash or card]"" or a better phrase. Take note that not all staff are good in directions, so it's better to ask Google Maps beforehand. Overall, the staff are fun to interact with, especially the one at the night shift to early morning.I even requested the staff to make a reservation for a café in Ōme, a city located at the far end of Tokyo prefecture, and it went out well.The bunk beds are ok; you can have them replaced if you want to. Bathrooms are great, especially the high tech bidet which is famous in many parts of Japan. Shower is great; you can even have a very hot shower, especially that I visited last autumn (November 2017).I will stay at Bunka Hostel if ever I want to visit Tokyo again!","March 5, 2018","28    Bunka Hostel Tokyo

1464,"Pros:- proximity from the subway station- proximity to the main sites in Asakusa - on a street with many restaurants - clean- new - privacy curtain for each bunk bed capsuleCons:- no public space to relax in. The dorms have only beds and no space. The common area on the 7th floor is a small table that seats 8. For a hostel with so many beds this is very small. No atmosphere. - almost non-existent kitchen. The said common area has a fridge, a microwave, a kettle and some utensils and plates. No stoves for cooking. - the rails of the ladder going up to the top bunk is a steel and circular - uncomfortable to step on- the room is noisy (shared amongst 30+ people)- bad ventilation (cannot open window), and stuffy - the cubicle (bed) is very bare- unfinished plywood nailed together. Feels very sterile.I think as a place to only sleep for a night it does the job, but as there is no space to relax in (except in your own bed capsule) or cook (unless you order a drink or food at the cafe on the first floor), I would prefer staying elsewhere next time.","December 29, 2017","28    Bunka Hostel Tokyo

1465,"Bunka hostel is a super cool hostel right in the heart of Asakusa. The thing that I loved about this place was the size of the dorm 'capsule' beds. Basically you get a little private room thats dark and quiet, which is essential if you're jet lagged. It's definitely an upgrade from your standard hostel dorm room. The bathrooms were super clean and there were even washer/dryers there. The food downstairs is not the best, but breakfast is cheap and there's tons of other food around within walking distance. I'd definitely stay here again.","October 30, 2017","28    Bunka Hostel Tokyo

If you are craving with fast food, there is McDonald right across the hostel. The staffs were nice. I love how they designed the hostel. I stayed in female dormitory, which was located on one floor. There are many bunk beds designed nicely in one floor, each has privacy curtain, plugs and light. The bathrooms are still in the same floor separated by different doors, with the shower rooms and toilets. There is a common room where you can enjoy reading and eating your own food.

1469,"Almost perfect. I stayed for one night only and mostly my experience is 100% positive. It's a new hostel, in a one of the strategist hostel location i've ever stayed before. Distance to station is only a 5 minutes, across the hostel, there's mcdonald and 24 hours cheap place to eat. 24 hours reception (gosh, i hope most hostel copy Bunka hostel's, it's very helpful if i arrived in tokyo late night ) and the reception staffs are amazing, they speak english very well, and really helpful to many of my questions.Staffs are friendly, sometimes they started a conversation, so it does'nt feel very formal and boring. Rooms Room is clean and nice, bed is comfortable and big enough, i loved the configuration of the bed, so when i climbed to my upper bed, i shouldn't see bottom bed because it's not like usual capsule configuration. 1. Good configuration2. Bed is nice and comfortable3. size of the capsule is big enough4. toilets and shower rooms are clean.5. laundry facilities is great and convinient cons: 1. I wish there're more bigger locker where i can store my bag (my daypack bag can't even fit into the locker) not to mention my small baggage. So i need to take out my laptop and other valuable to be stored. So a disappointment with the size of the locker.2. Since the locker can't fit daypack, so baggage was out of question. The corridor of the capsule was filled with baggage and suitcase, some even in scattered condition, making it kinda messy. Other facilites such as common room in 7th floor, kinda small and packed with people when i went there, so mostly i sticked around in the first floor to enjoy watching people passing by the street. Bar and restaurant was a great experience, it has a nice interior design ( one of the reason i stayed here, because i'm an architect, i stayed here to feel the ambience and the interior) The restaurant has different type of schedule, there're lunch time and dinner time, so better to read carefully before entering. The prices in the restaurant, i should say, it's higher than usual restaurant you'd encounter even in touristic area. but it's okay for me after i've tried the food, the price came with great quality. The food was awesome, i mean, well, good food surely come with price. But don't worry, some ocassion, there're some event or some promotion, when i stayed there, there're happy hour deals, so beers got discounted from 600 yen to 400 yen only from 5pm to 8pm. The beer is great, ice coffee also great to fill the time in the restaurant. The curry karage was one of the dishes i've tasted, pricey, but surely delicious, recommended. top notch by the chef. Staffs is amazing, the dedication to open reception 24 hours is a big plus of Bunka hostel. unfortunately, when i came, there're no schedules tour event or near event created by bunka hostel, so my experience in the hostel was purely only the room experience, staffs and the restaurant","September 5, 2017","28    Bunka Hostel Tokyo

Even though the dorms are huge, it's quite enough to sleep and you have a fair bit of privacy with the curtains, which is nice. The beds are comfy and quite big. The restaurant downstairs serves good coffee. Bathrooms are modern and spacious as well, it would only be nice if the showers would be cleaned more frequently - however it was still clean most of the times, but after ""shower-rushhour"" you could tell that a lot of people were sharing the showers.

Everyone had a small locker for valuables, and there was enough room to keep larger cases to the side of the beds (not locked away though). Wifi never cut out, and staff were all really nice.Only thing that might be a problem for some is that it isn't a very sociable hostel - there isn't a lounge as such (only a small kitchen upstairs), and the eating area downstairs is a bar/restaurant in the evening so you can't really just hang out there.","April 1, 2017","28    Bunka Hostel Tokyo

The bed environment is not so bad, but the hair around the water is considerably scattered, the shower room is dirty and it is not sanitary.The most shocking thing is that the food that I had in the refrigerator in the free space on the 7th floor was all morning morning. I put a room number and name on my stuff as a rule and pasted it, but it disappeared.Although it is sharing, I have stayed at several hostels so far, but this has never happened yet.Clearly, food and drinks are never cheap.

Just some minor negatives point: 1. there was no USB plus on the pods. Foods for thoughts for a future improvement. 2. there was only one shower in my floor. It was not a big deal, but if everyone is leaving at the same time could boring waiting to have shower. Apart from that, perfect stay. Definitely recommend!

1497,"As you've probably seen on the Internet, this place has excellent reviews. And I can definitely recommend it if you're looking for a hostel with top notch quality for not that much money.The hostel is Asakusa, which is a nice area on its own. It's close to the famous Senso-Ji temple which you can't miss if you hop out the metro. Asakusa is a bit further out from places like Shinjuku, Shibuya or Harajuku (30min metro). In my opinion it doesn't really matter because public transport within Tokyo is excellent. The hostel itself has friendly staff. The lounge / bar area is nice to hang around in the evenings and they even provide a cheap western breakfast in the mornings. I had a mixed dormitory. There are about 24 bunks on each dormitory, which is quite a lot. You have your own private space which is nice. You have a locker and a free towel each day provided. The bathrooms are brand new and clean. I picked this place for two nights. I stayed my first nights in the western part of the city in Shinjuku and the other nights here. I liked the difference and was able to split up different activities this way.This place is an easy pick if you're looking to save some yen during your stay in Japan. As you've noticed hotels aren't cheap. I really liked the place, but keep in mind that you don't have that much privacy. With 24 people on one room you might be awakened early or in the middle of the night. Once more, excellent place and great staff. Would recommend. (Tip: go to restaurant Gin-Shachi close by, great place and food where you sit near the grill)","October 22, 2016","28    Bunka Hostel Tokyo

The staff was kind, the rooms and bathrooms were spotless and the location was very convenient and a quick walk to two main train stations including the Asakusa station (did I mention it's also super close to the sensoji temple as well? - about a 6 min walk). I also enjoyed shopping nearby in the Asakusa shopping areas - I found a great store with vintage kimonos that were absolutely beautiful, floor length and gorgeous for $10 each!

1500,"Located in the Asakusa Area, its' just a couple of blocks from the Sensoji Temple & Nakamise Market. The hotel is located near a lot of restaurants and stores. There is a 24 hr Don Quixote just 2-3 blocks from the hotel. The hotel had nice and clean rooms. They had clean beds and a good size locker. Sheets and towels were changed daily if you wanted. They have a keycard to ensure only assigned guests are able to enter your room. They have good size washers and dryers. We were able to book an entire room on one of the floors because of how big our group was. Staff were very accommodating and friendly. I like how open and inviting their lobby and restaurant was. Their kitchen area on the top floor was small though compared to other hostels i've stayed at. It had a microwave, refrigerator, sink, and minimal equipment. You'll have to label your drinks and food when leaving stuff in the refrigerator. One of my favourite parts of the hostel is their balcony where you can see the Tokyo Skytree.","September 18, 2016","28    Bunka Hostel Tokyo

I never had to wait for a shower, their were 3 on my floor. Super cool design and the wifi always worked really well. There is an onsen within 1 minute walk that is open till late, it allows tattoos and is super cheap. Ask staff for directions. I also recommend eating at gyoza hall and the Japanese beef restaurant with the colourful cows outside, both within a 1 minute walk from the hostel.

1504,"Bunka Hostel is almost more of a capsule hotel than a hostel. Each floor has a large dorm room (one floor is female-only) with a number of upper and lower bunks - each of which is mostly enclosed in plywood (except for the area where you climb in which has a curtain - which gives a greater deal of privacy than standard hostels. The mattresses and pillows are new and comfortable, and each bunk includes individual lights and power outlets. The ladders going up to the top bunks are not the most comfortable for walking on barefoot, with tubular metal rungs. Also, there seem to be round holes (for ventilation?) between the top and bottom bunks, which takes a little away from the privacy as light and noise from one bunk to the other passes through.There is locker space in the dorm, though lockers are on the small side (I struggled to fit my medium sized daypack inside), so they are more just for you valuables and most people keep their suitcases next to their bunks. There are 3 showers and 5+ toilets on each floor, along with a row of sinks. Everything is kept incredibly clean and the bathrooms include hairdryers and soap/shampoo in the showers so you don't have to bring your own.The staff are friendly and helpful, there's a small bar/restaurant on the main floor. Wifi was fast and reliable throughout the building, and you need a key card to access the elevator and dorms, so it's quite secure.Bunka's location is great - right in the heart of Asakusa. There are tons of restaurants nearby (the specialty of Asakusa is tempura - enjoy!), and it's near a number of tourist sights in Ueno. It's a 5 minute walk from Asakusa station (which has direct access to and from Narita and Haneda), and about a 10 - 15 minute walk from Ueno station (which is on the circular JR line that stops at all the major sightseeing areas of Tokyo).","July 25, 2016","28    Bunka Hostel Tokyo

My 11 and 14 year old boys were excited about the accommodations and the box type bed. The mattress, blankets, pillows and towels were like Marriott hotel clean and crisp. The room was spacious enough for 4 of us and there even was a huge couch on side. We had a nice view of the Skytree tower. The common dining area was excellent to microwave and refrigerate food items. There is no TV which was fine because you are in Tokyo to visit places.

Breakfast is a mixed buffet with a range of country styles. Staff are very helpful. McDonalds and KFC are outside. It is close to the very nice Gyoen Park (flower gardens) as well as a short stroll to the high rise (Observatory Metropolitan Government building 1)where you can go to the 45th floor and view the city skyline for free. Better than paying at Skytree! Also hundreds of very good reasonably priced cafes and restaurants nearby - both above and below ground, serving very fresh high quality seafood and beef and noodle menus for all the workers before they take their long train ride home from nearby Shinjuku Station. This train station has 3 million people using it each day! Easy to use and an ideal way to see Tokyo. Coffee is good at Cafes across the lane, but all allow smoking (ugh!).

1516,"We stayed here towards the end of the cherry blossom season and got a twin room at SGD$313/ per night inclusive of all taxes. The location is off the main road which made it quiet in the evening but also close enough to transport (bus and train terminals). This made travelling easy. Getting food was also easy as there are a few convenience stores less than 5 minutes walk from the hotel, fast food chains, late night restaurants and food bars across the street (head towards the back lanes of Wendy’s)Room had a good layout that maximised space for the beds, and managing a shower and tub in the bathroom. It was on the pricey end for hotels but we enjoyed our stay and will return here again. I also had a few queries that I communicated with the hotel email, and they replied very quickly. Thank you!Just a note to those taking Narita Express to check the schedule on the last train, as I missed it and took the Skyliner instead to the hotel (change trains at Nippori) however this was pretty manageable with one luggage.

1517,"Three of us (two adults and a teen) stayed at JR Blossom Shinjuku for 3 nights during April of this year, right in the middle of peak Hanami. We shared a deluxe twin, with an extra bed, which was a corner room. The hotel itself is easy to find, a short walk across the street from the Southwest entrance to Shinjuku station. Check in was easy (we reserved through Agoda-sorry Tripadvisor) and they had fulfilled our request for a high room (14th floor). It's got a clean ambiance, not fancy but comfortable and warm. The room itself was cosy, with the W.C. located away from the beds and bathroom. Amenities included robes, slippers and toiletries. No room service, but with literally dozens of food options just outside, why would you bother with room service?In April, the weather was mild, so we didn't have to mess with the HVAC system much, but it did the job in keeping our room comfortable. The beds were standard twins with hard pillows, but everything was actually remarkably comfortable and we all slept well each night after a day of hard touristing...We had no problems with noice, odd smells or anything untoward, really.We had breakfast at the Hotel Restaurant-- a good buffet with a mix of Japanese and Western food, as well as omelettes made to order. While some what pricey, like most hotel buffets, it was an easy and very comfortable way to start the day. Overall, would recommend the hotel for its location, comfort and relative cost. We think it's a good choice for the budget conscious family or business traveler who doesn't need to be overly catered to, but wants something comfortable and welcoming to return to at the end of a long Tokyo day.Thank you so much.

1524,"On the first night, I slept with the left side of my face on the pillow and in the morning when I woke up my left cheek and ear felt extremely itchy and there are red rashes all over my face, with the right side of my face being completely fine. This has never occurred on me and my face was never in such a condition. Unfortunately, the rashes did not die down during my stay in Tokyo or after I went back to Hong Kong. So I visited a dermatologist on the 25th, and my dermatologist diagnosed that my face was having a serious inflammation, and the rashes occurred due to physical contact which was caused from poor hygiene, very likely by an uncleaned pillow and chemical contact. I was prescripted with steroid in order to cure the condition on my face. There was also a lot of grey dust inside the toilet, by the side of the toilet seat and very strangely, I also saw used toothpicks at my room door on the first day upon my arrival. All the above incidents make me question if they actually clean the rooms PROPERLY or if the hotel is just making the rooms look as if they are cleaned? Everyone knows that hotel rooms cannot be that 'cleaned' however what happened was not an acceptable standard at all. What was more disappointing is that I have sent an e-mail to the hotel but there wasn't a single apology from the hotel and the reply was also rude from their general manager. They simply refer to my allergy to 'detergents at cleaning, materials in pillows, and cover materials' When I was diagnosed with a dermatologist who has seen my face in person. The hotel did not apologise nor did they suggest what changes they will try to make in the future, they just simply refer this to my 'personal problem'.I would not recommend this hotel to anyone since there are so many other choices in the same area. The level of hygiene and cleanliness is not acceptable and the reply I received shows an extremely poor attitude from the hotel. 第一天晚上，我的左臉睡在枕頭上，早上醒來的時候，我的左臉頰和耳朵都感覺非常癢，臉上全是紅色的皮疹，臉的右就完全沒問題。這從未發生在我身上，我的臉從未出現過這種情況。不幸的是，在我在東京逗留期間或者在我回到香港之後，皮疹並沒有消失。所以我第二天去看了一位皮膚科醫生，我的皮膚科醫生診斷出我的臉上有嚴重的發炎，皮疹是由於臉上皮膚與不幹淨，衛生不佳的物品接觸造成的，很可能是由於未清潔的枕頭和化學接觸引起的。為了治愈我臉上的狀況，我開了類固醇處方。我抵達的第一天也發現了廁所有非常非常多的灰塵，由其在馬桶的側面。非常離奇地在我的房門口使用過牙籤。所有上述事件讓我有疑問，他們是否真正地打掃幹淨房間，或者酒店是否只是讓房間看起來像是在清潔？每個人都知道酒店房間不能真的100%“清潔”，但發生的事情根本不可接受。更令人失望的是，我發了一封電子郵件到酒店，但酒店沒有任何道歉，他們的經理的態度也是非常不禮貌的。當我被皮膚科醫生診斷出，他們只是說我是對“清潔用洗滌劑，枕頭材料和封面材料”的過敏，。酒店沒有道歉，他們也沒有建議他們將來會做出哪些改變，他們只是簡單地將這個改為我的“個人問題”。我不會向任何人推薦這家酒店，因為在同一地區有很多其他選擇。衛生和清潔程度是不可接受的，酒店的態度也是極差。","January 30, 2019","29    JR Kyushu Hotel Blossom Shinjuku

The first night we check in and realize one of our luggage was missing. The staff was very helpful in helping us to contact the courier service and arrange luggage delivery on the second night. But ehe Chinese staff at the receptionist isn’t that friendly and helpful on the second night. The staff just inform us the luggage is not there and pass us the courier service slip despite knowing that it’ll be more convenient for them to help us contact the courier service since we might have some language barrier in communication. After we requested for her help, she called awhile and told us didn’t get through. End up we have to call the courier service and locate our luggage ourselves.

They provide bottled water, a robe and slippers, the room has a bar fridge and a large TV although English channels are limited.The breakfast buffet is small but has Western and Asian options and the staff are happy and very helpful.Location wise it is nice and close to Shinjuku station - about a 5- 10 minute walk, slightly uphill on the way to the station.

There was one night that the reception called my room at around 10:30pm telling me that my son were too loud and the room on the lower floor is complaining. My son was just talking normally, not shouting, but still, I asked him to lower his voice. 10 mins later, a staff knock on my door even when I had the ""Do Not Disturb"" sign out, telling me to quiet down again. About 30 mins later, when my son was already asleep. reception called again and woke us up, telling me that lower floor is still complaining and requested me to change room on the next day. It took me over an hour to put my son back to sleep, then I went down to the reception at 1am to understand 1) why I would need to change room when we were never loud, 2) why the staff knock on the door when we had the do not disturb sign, 3) we were already sleeping and they still called near mid-night.

You don’t have to get into the bath to have a shower like most hotels but is instead next to the bath and the water drains through the drain on the tiled floor. Stayed in twin bedroom which suited us. The room is quite small compared to western hotels but apparently is normal for Japan. Has basic hotel necessities with big flat screen tv, kettle, glasses and mugs, hair dryer, shampoo etc. has an AC with heating and cooling functions but is in Japanese. Very close to Shinjuku station and the hub of Shinjuku - only about a 8-10min walk. There are restaurants as well as fast food outlets at the entrance including a McDonald’s and other food outlets only a few minutes walk away. There’s a food mart near the entrance too. Huge shopping malls with the moderate to higher end retail such as Lumine are at the crossing near the hotel.The workers there speak some English - enough to deal with basic necessities.

Later that evening while I was out I received an email from hotelquickly to say I cannot stay there as jr blossom will not take there payment. When I went back to the hotel I was told that hotelquickly will not do a direct deposit into there account and had not responded there emails. so in the last 3 days It was hard to contact hotelquickly as they would not answer there phone and a recording kept saying that they were unavailable. So it took 26 phone calls and 19 emails before this was sorted out. In the end I had to repay for the booking then get a refund from hotlequickly. This had ruined my last 3 days in Tokyo. It was unproffessional from both Jr blossom and hotelsquickly. Jr blossom should have taken responsibilty for this as they are the ones who chose to advertise there hotel with Hotelsquickly, and hotels quickly should make it easier to contact them and should learn to reply to emails quickly. poor Proffessionalism on both sides.

1541,"I originally wrote a scathing review of this hotel but had removed it and rewrote it as things had actually gotten so bad as our stay progressed that the hotel had eventually done something about it. We stayed at Jr hotel blossom Shinjuku for 2 nights in October 2018 having previously enjoyed our last long stay in 2016. The hotel's website doesn't quite work so we booked a double room (same room type we stayed before) through a large online travel agent. As it was the end of a long trip and before a long haul flight, we knew that the double room is spacious enough for packing and relaxing. The hotel is also a short walk away from the South East exit at Shinjuku station, making it really accessible to and from the Narita Express. This made us willing to pay the pricey ~USD$250/night stay.When we attempted to check-in, the clerk at reception actually did not honour our booking, and was quick to blame the OTA for the mess up. They had actually downgraded us to a semi-double room. The clerk was unhelpful in that respect, despite being shown the confirmation we received of the room type, not offering us any options but simply stating we needed to contact the OTA ourselves to sort this out. We did, and after spending over an hour going back and forth, the OTA said that they had spoken to the hotel who continued to refuse to honour the reservation, and as a solution they said the hotel said we could upgrade to a double room by paying the difference; the OTA will then reimburse us. Lo and behold, when I returned to speak to the clerk, it was only then that she told me that they had no double rooms available, perhaps I might want to upgrade to a much pricier twin room? As I couldn't reach the OTA again to verify without spending another hour or so tearing my hair out, and as we were travelling as a couple so paying so much extra for a twin room is not really appropriate, we begrudgingly settled for the semi-double. The clerks all knew that we weren't happy but we're unwilling to help.Meanwhile, we spotted a mouse in the lobby and reported to the staff who managed to chase it down and capture it...The semi-double, compared to the double room, was much smaller. The bed was pushed against the wall, and there isn't enough room to open 2 luggages. The bathroom was thankfully a decent size. The room was filthy though, the surfaces were sticky and there was a thick layer of dust in the corners and on surfaces like the outside of the fridge. There were also mould/mildew marks on the walls in the room and in the bathroom. When we returned to the room late at night, we were horrified to see a cockroach scurry across the desk and onto the curtain. We were lucky that we were quick enough to kill it. This unsettled us a lot and we called the front desk to ask for a room change immediately, only to be told that it will not be possible as they are now... Fully booked. Hmm? Given the exchange we had earlier in the day it seemed more like they just didn't want to give us a better room, as a good hotelier might have done that from the start instead of downgrading us. As a compromise we requested that they provided us with some form of insecticide. The staff that came up with the spray was probably the first helpful and sincere person we encountered here, and he helpfully sprayed all the surfaces down inside as well as outside of the room. We also had him take away the body of the dead cockroach as we didn't want it in the room with us. Perhaps the dead body was what gave them to push, and we received a call shortly after informing us that they could change the room... But the next day around midday so we had to check out of this disgusting room the next day.As you can imagine, we were not able to rest well that night. We had to repack everything and also wondered whether there were more cockroaches hiding inside our baggages. Given the behaviour of the hotel so far we were also uncertain about whether the next room is going to be any better and to be honest we considered going elsewhere. Since it was past midnight now and we were exhausted we decided to just stick it out.When we returned at the end of the 2nd day to check into our new room, the staff checking in then apologised profusely but only for the cockroach, not the room type mix-up. They had also helped moved our baggage to the new room which was nice.We were very pleasantly surprised to find that they had checked us into a twin room with a view towards Shinjuku station/government tower, given that our experience with their hospitality had been so bad the day before. This was a nice touch, unfortunately since we were checking out very early the next morning, so we only used this room for about 7 hours or so. What really baffled us was how this room was many, many folds cleaner than the previous room. While there were still mark on the wall and in the bathroom, the marks were more consistent with age and wear and tear, rather than from the lack of care. It was perhaps what we would have expected the double room we booked to be. It suggests to us that the hotel does provide a different level of service in accordance to the room types, so if you're thinking of taking the cheapest room it might not be worth it at all. Sadly for us we had the cockroach to thank for our better second night... Not the fact that we had actually paid for a standard double.When we checked out the clerk was nice and offered to help us post our pocket WiFi back without prompting. So many things went wrong from the start and it was only at the very end that the hotel made some attempt to help us. Unfortunately the attempts were far too late to change our overall negative impression of the place, and while we recognise that some effort was made, we still feel that we cannot recommend this place not are we likely to return. The service we received was completely inconsistent. To be fair to the hotel we had also provided this feedback directly, so perhaps they might improve their cleanliness and service level for the future. This was certainly not the 4 star hotel we were expecting.TLDR: at the time of our stay there was a hygiene and cleanliness issue at the hotel, with some level of mice and cockroaches infestation. Cheaper rooms were not cleaned properly. Beware of booking via OTAs as the hotel might not honour the bookings and actually will downgrade customers than upgrade. The hotel's booking website might not work - it never showed us any advanced availability. The service we received varied a lot - we had interacted with staff a lot during our short 2 night stay but only a handful towards the end didn't make us feel unwanted.","October 24, 2018","29    JR Kyushu Hotel Blossom Shinjuku

We took the NEX train from Narita airport, which was simple and easy to use. I went for the Deluxe room (corner room, with a little sitting area, mini walk-in closet, and toilet down the hall away from the beds). We were on the 13th floor with a great view of Shinjuku.I never heard any other guests while in the room, so it's very quiet. I also got the breakfast package since I didn't want to bother hunting around for breakfast in the morning (it is very busy around this hotel), it was a tad expensive (what isn't in Japan, LOL). However, I thought the Japanese breakfast and the service was outstanding. The washer/dryer on every 3rd or 4th floor was handy (the washer includes detergent when you run a cycle, so you don't need to buy any). One thing that is amazing is that you get an Android web-enabled phone (you can't call with it, but can access all Android apps, like Google Maps), this was awesome to have during our day outings, I was able to access Google Maps, TripAdvisor, Yelp all without using my own roaming plan.

There is a family mart close by as well.Front desk service was friendly and helpful.We did not ask them for much however.We stayed in a standard double room. The room was bigger then some of the other hotels in Tokyo, but like all hotels in Tokyo they are still small.Room was very clean, had everything we needed.Given the ease of access to transport, the size and price of the room I would stay here again.There is nothing unique/special about it, but when your out all day and most of the night enjoying Tokyo its all you need really.Clean, convenient and good value.","August 26, 2018","29    JR Kyushu Hotel Blossom Shinjuku

1550,"this hotel is conveniently located with easy assess to the metro, shopping and eating all within walking distance. The best way to get to this hotel from the narita airport is by bus which stop at the sunroute plaza hotel which is just right at the back of this hotel. This is a bit closer than stopping at the central bus station. The room is bigger than regular hotel rooms around here and we still got a small table and seats by the window. Everything is good and staff are friendly. There is also free bottled water from Kyushu. ","August 23, 2018","29    JR Kyushu Hotel Blossom Shinjuku

1551,"My daughter and I stayed here for three nights in July. We stayed at Keio Plaza before, but I’d definitely come back to JR Kyushu in a heartbeat. It’s literally 3 minuets away from the express bus station and 5 minuets away from JR Station! There are ton of restaurants, dept. stores, shops, and convenience stores around. We booked a twin room which is roomier than I expected. Clean and efficient. The only complaint is that there was an occasionally musty smell in the shower room. It puzzled me because the bath/shower room was spotless. ","August 16, 2018","29    JR Kyushu Hotel Blossom Shinjuku

1552,"I have stayed here twice now. Once in March 2017 and once in July 2018. Shinjuku station is literally 5 minutes away by foot (main entrance) and less than that to some of the many other entrances and exits (you'll find you will head to the main entrance as it's quite a complex station for tourists. From Shinjuku station you can pretty get anywhere you want with ease.I travelled with my son and booked a twin room which is adequate although not too much in the way of hanging space for clothes. However in July it was shorts and T shirts and when I visit again in 2020 I'll pack less clothes.I arranged for my main luggage to be sent from Osaka to this hotel whilst we travelled around rural Japan, and on arrival at the Blossom the cases were already in our room (very cheap and easy to organise)Unless you are looking to wine and dine at your chosen hotel in Tokyo, I can't see what more one could want.The rooms are clean, air con is good, staff are professional and pleasant. I wouldn't stay anywhere else because this hotel caters for all of my needs.It's not 5 star, nor is it 5 star prices, and twice now when staying at this hotel it's been typically out of the room by 10.30am and return by midnight. That's Tokyo for me.I've spent 35 days in Japan over the last 2 years and JR Kyushu Hotel Blossom Shinjuku is perfect for me. I prefer Harajuku as an area, but I wouldn't want to be based there. I booked direct with the hotel as that is always my preference.Using the adage 'if it ain't broken don't fix it', I can not see myself choosing elsewhere next time I visit which hopefully will be for the summer Olympics.","August 4, 2018","29    JR Kyushu Hotel Blossom Shinjuku

1553,"Overall - really enjoyed my stay in the hotel. 1) Rooms - small (but within expectation), very clean with the bathroom amenities replenished daily. Bathroom has a full bath tub and not those half or 3/4 bath tub some hotels have to save space. Only issue I had was that we had 2 24inch luggage and we struggled to find space to open both flat.2) Location - absolute winner. Hotel is literally a stone’s throw away from Shinjuku and a Lawson (useful for any last minute drink or coffee purchases late in the evening). I would estimate a walk to the subway (Oedo and Shinjuku line) to be about 3 mins, JR Shinjuku Station to be about 5 mins and another subway (Marounichi) to be about 8 mins. It is also easy to get from Haneda airport to this hotel as the airport limousine stops at Sunroute which is only 1 street away. Suggest if this option is not available since there are limited timings on when the bus stops at Sunroute, you can also consider dropping off at the bus terminal and making your way here. 3) Service - allowed for an early checkin at 1pm and also helped to make reservations at other dining options. It was a pleasure dealing with the front desk.Would stay again and would recommend others to try if they are looking for a reasonably priced hotel in the Shinjuku area. :)","July 24, 2018","29    JR Kyushu Hotel Blossom Shinjuku

1554,We stayed three nights at JR Kyushu Hotel Blossom Shinjuku this time and still great! We booked it via the official site and selected a double bedroom. It's slightly smaller than a twin room however still have plenty of room to move round. Love that a bath is available instead of a walk-in shower. Bed is comfortable. Friends are friendly and with a smile. Not to mention the location is excellent.

1558,We spent 3 nights at this stylish downtown hotel. The rooms were small which was to be expected due to it’s location and we were unable to get a double due to the popularity of this hotel.The rooms were comfortable and had everything you could reasonably expect in them including a very powerful shower and the wonderful toilets with a heated seats and various other interesting gadgets.The staff were efficient and polite the whole place was immaculately clean. The best bit without doubt was the location a short 5 minute walk to Shinjuku station and great restaurants and bars within easy walking distance.The hotel is great if you want a comfortable place to stay in the epicentre of Tokyo. Probably not the place to stay if you want more of a resort experience as the facilities aren’t there if that is what you are seeking. Plenty of cheap breakfast options nearby.

1572,"Stayed at this hostel for 4 nights in total.Very nice and hip little reception (ambiance wise), lobby and bar area. However, the lobby/ reception area has a very strong stench and smells like the toilet and so does the lift, especially the lift since it is such a small and enclosed space. The stench is unbearable. It was very stuffy and warm at the lobby area as well. Combine the stench and warm area, we did not want to hang round the area for any longer than we should, it is a shame because we did not get much chance to interact with other guests staying at the hostel. Room was decently cleaned for the most part, however given we can only check in at 4pm, you would think and expect a more thorough clean of the rooms. It was very dusty at some parts of the room and this was a little disappointing. Furthermore, we realised whenever it came to a certain time in the morning, the air-conditioning in the room will not work any more and will just be blowing out room temperature air which made the room a little too stuffy and warm. The cold air will only come back rather late at night.Toilet was clean and like most of the toilets in Japan, they have the bidet which was awesome.Shower room was only average, we have been to other hostels which had more occupants and had managed to maintain a much cleaner shower room. Amenities provided in the shower was quite standard like other hostels, you have your shampoo, conditioner and body wash. Then came the ultimatum, when we were asking for information at the reception one night, one of the staff member was clearly intoxicated and could not hold an otherwise simple and easy conversation. All the reception staff members spoke a decent level of English.Overall ok experience, will think twice about coming back to stay at this hostel.","November 7, 2018","30    WISE OWL HOSTELS SHIBUYA

That was to be expected though, and it was actually kind of cozy :) The only downside was that the room was not very soundproof and loud guests were coming in at around 1-2am, so this may not be the best option for those who go to sleep a bit earlier.The toilets and showers were kept very clean.","May 16, 2018","30    WISE OWL HOSTELS SHIBUYA

But if that's not an important detail for you, the rooms, showers and kitchen area are definitely satisfactory. In fact the beds are quite comfortable! My only complaint would be, well atleast in my room there was no way to control the heat or air, but it was very hot so we slept with the window open, but there is a smoking pavilion of sorts behind the hotel, where apparently people like to gather at in the middle of the night and it can get very, very noisy, so bring earplugs! ;-) ","April 30, 2018","30    WISE OWL HOSTELS SHIBUYA

Down side is you have to manage your personal items pretty much in any area available in hallway, under the bed, etc. if you're traveling with load of items it might be a bit tough. Also if you're staying for longer dates, it might get a bit tiring. Bed is enough to sleep on but could be bit stiff. It's about 20min walk to hear to Shibuya, or take a bus for 10min.

1599,"The reviews on here really don't highlight just how small the rooms are - my boyfriend and I booked a twin room, and as it's a hostel in Tokyo we were expecting small, but this was a whole other level. We ended up with a bunk bed with no space on either side, with a very small area to put our belongings, and not enough floor space for the both of us to stand up at the same time. Also there is no curfew here, the walls are paper thin, and the floor and ceiling were concrete so noise carried, so both nights we were woken at 12.30-1am by guests coming in speaking very loudly and letting doors slam shut behind them (we ended up having to buy ear plugs to sleep through). The bathrooms were clean and showers decent size. I would also advise that although we didn't mind as we travelled as a couple, there is a very small eating area and no common area, so it would be difficult to socialise if travelling solo. Overall the hostel is fine if staying 1 or 2 nights but wouldn't want to stay any longer.","January 15, 2018","30    WISE OWL HOSTELS SHIBUYA

1602,"My friend and I were in Tokyo for a week and needed a place that was clean, affordable and in a good location for exploring and Wise Owl Shibuya gave us just that. The location is ideal. It's on the edge of Shibuya, which allows a short walk to all the restaurants, shopping, etc. you could want while being just far enough away to avoid the noise and crowds. It's also a moderate walk or short bus ride to the Shibuya Train Station. It was a great base camp for exploring Tokyo and making some day trips.Tokyo is the safest major city on the planet, but I'll say it anyway, this location was in a very safe location. We walked in all directions at all hours and never found an unsafe area. The rooms have electronic locks and the whole area seemed fine for any age or gender.We chose the small private room for our accommodations. It suited our needs as a place to sleep on a decent bed. If you choose this option, just be aware that small means small. There was just enough room for the bunk bed, a tiny sink and that's basically it. There's almost not enough room for two people to stand. We had to store our luggage at the opposite end of the bed under the window, which requires unpacking/packing on your actual bed. That might be a problem for some, but for us, we spent almost every waking hour in the city, so tight quarters weren't an issue. We didn't travel all the way to Japan just to stay in our hostel. There are small, lockable cabinets on each bed as well as a couple of outlets.Everything was very clean, from the rooms to the bathrooms to the showers. Sheets were fine on the beds. Toilets and showers were clean. We never ran into any long lines trying to use the facilities at any point in the day. A towel was provided and they have shampoo/conditioner/body wash in the showers, though I suggest bringing your own wash cloth. There's a small restaurant on the main floor. I never used it but my friend ordered a few things throughout the trip. We walked across the street to Lawson for a quick breakfast every morning and ate elsewhere for lunch and dinner.The staff is all very friendly and helpful. They spoke english and were able to answer all of our questions.I would highly recommend this hostel for anyone looking for a nice, affordable place to get some sleep while spending most of the day out in Tokyo.","January 1, 2018","30    WISE OWL HOSTELS SHIBUYA

For a hostel, I was amazed at the friendliness, presentation, cleanliness and location of the hostel.It was a stormy night when I arrived, and I was soaked through to the skin. The girl at front desk gave me a towel straight away before she took my booking details.The hostel was well equipped. Cooking kitchen on each floor, a good amount of showers and toilets (I never had to wait), They had hairdryers and those self-heating toilets too.The decor is very modern and cool. The sleeping dorms are cosy and small- and each cubicle has it's own lock box for your belongings.The kitchen downstairs offered good food and beer too, but I wouldn't eat here every night, as I found it a little pricey- however, the kitchen staff were very friendly and appreciative of my comments on their rice pork bowl!The hostel did a lot of events and made notices for upcoming attractions and festivals going on in the area- which was a really cool way to integrate solo travelers. You were never short of options on things to do, and the staff were also very cool and welcoming - they even announce they are going for beer/food and offer spaces for people to come along!What i really loved about WOS was, after I checked out, I filled in a feedback card and chatted to the staff about Ireland (my country). One of the staff were going there soon for a visit. I was short on time and had to run for my bus.I was walking for about 2 minutes and I looked around to one of the female staff running after me - i thought i left something behind - but now, she ran after me to give me a discount card for the hostel, should I book again. Simply because I filled in a feedback card. This simple gesture stuck with me and really summed up how great my stay was at WOS. I will certainly be back.

The rooms go from private to dormitory style, plus separate male/female floor is available. All amenities are modern. One of my favorite part is their restaurant: Mother Farmer's Table.

The location is good with shops all around, including a department store. The hotel provides a free smart phone which was very handy for directions. They called a taxi for me to take me to Tokyo station (where I was to catch the Shinkansen to Kyoto) whilst I relaxed in the lobby until it arrived, and carrying my luggage for me when it did which was good service.","May 21, 2018","31    Solaria nishitetsu hotel Ginza

1627,"I was pleased with this boutique hotel in terms of location in central Ginza, easy walk to the fish market. It was quite pleasure to be able to walk out of the hotel in be so centrally located-in the midst of busy Ginza, yet the street on the hotel was on was quiet and low key. The rooms were compact more so than the pictures, Suitcases had to be stacked to walk around and it was tight with two people. The bathroom was clean, well proportioned and I loved having a separate shower/bath area.The service- the front desk staff always was respectful and tried hard to help, however at times they were unable to help us with what we needed- One example, a friend got sick while there and the front desk staff could not locate an English speaking doctor in the area, or anywhere in Tokyo, or followed up to see if we were ok- I would expect a hotel of that size to at least have a few names to refer to. We unfortunately had to leave early because of this illness and didn't get any credit on multiple nights. I have been in situations where I've had to leave early and have had more understanding on the part of the hotel staff.","May 19, 2018","31    Solaria nishitetsu hotel Ginza

1629,"Room is pretty tiny and it didn't help that they have a couch squeezed into the tiny space. Photos of room look better online than in reality. The facade of the hotel looks really stylish but the room was a pretty far cry. The bathtub uses a dated shower curtain instead of those modern glass doors in contemporary hotels. On the positive side they do provide the necessary bathroom amenities.No english channels on TV except BBC. They do provide a mobile phone/tablet that you can bring out which allows free internet access and calls to a handful of countries. They provide only 2 bottles of water a day. I tried to ask for an extra bottle of water and was flat out rejected. The only thing I love about the hotel is the location and proximity to Ginza station. Overall, it is a pretty fuss free hotel that is relatively clean. I noticed many Japanese guests.

1630,"The Solaria hotel is a nice, modern 13 floor hotel in an ideal location in Ginza. The rooms are small but very efficient and tastefully furnished. The separate shower and soaking tub provide a great way to unwind after a hard day of sightseeing and shopping. The hotel is just a couple minute walk from the Higashi-Ginza subway station and a five minute walk from the Mitsukoshi department store. The famous tsukiji fish market is just a ten minute walk from the hotel. There are lots of restaurants in the area, but be sure to go early since all the good ones get crowded real fast. The hotel’s breakfast buffet is odd. Only salad, juice and coffee are on the buffet line. You only have a choice of three different breakfast menus and you can’t get more unless you want more salad, coffee or juice. Weird.

The bathroom is worn and the bidet is not heated. The window panes are not sound proof and you hear rowdy noises from bar patrons at night, a doorbell noise from a security motion detector, and street noises like ambulances. It isn't located on the main road but somehow it's very noisy. Our room was on the 7th floor. I usually stayed at the hotel in front of it, Tokyu Stay Ginza, which is quite good. This hotel looks nice from the outside but the rooms badly need some updating. The pictures from Expedia and Travelocity makes the room look new and modern, but it's not.

I rate them a full 5 stars!There was however one (small) downside - there is a restaurant but no bar in the hotel. So waiting for family members and having a pre-dinner drink was not so easy ;).

My husband and I were extremely happy with the location of the hotel which allowed us to walk to and from the subway for our Haneda airport flights, and to walk to the train station for the trip to Osaka, although the train station might be outside what some would consider an acceptable walking distance. We found nearby restaurants, coffee, and convenience stores all within a few blocks of the hotel on safe, well lit streets. The room for both stays was small (what room in Japan is not?), functional and very clean. The rooms had extra towels and toiletries, a room safe, new slippers and pajamas on the bed for guest use, hair dryer, etc. We did not want for anything. Wifi access was good, and we did not watch TV. The staff was very friendly. The restaurant was lovely, but somewhat expensive. We only ate there once.

I forgot I stayed here before so I was a bit bummed when i walked over ( 20 min walk from Tokyo station) and entered cause I remembered it as a decent place but for some reason not my favorite. They must have renovated or I chose a better room because it was great. just great! The room had a double bed and while the view was in the back and windows were tinted the bathroom was huge with full tub and window to room. Great internet and clean and really A good place if you get the larger rooms. I'm not sure if I stayed in a different size room ( I don't think so ) Or if the room is larger cause it is in the back with no real view ( unless you crack the window) but it was great. The location is great. An easy walk to Tsukiji , Ginza, Shimbashi, Closed Ginza street on weekends. Just great. I do wish the window was not blurred out and that is my only complaint, but i was near the fire escape so there was a reason etc. You can't go wrong with 1 person or a couple here.

Perfectly convenient location for anyone with kids or on a shopping trip. However, A male staff was especially impolite upon our departure to the airport this morning. After checking out, we booked a vehicle and were waiting at the hotel's entrance. He came out to ask for a room key card and demanded for us to pay for breakfast. Breakfast has been paid for, and his colleague has acknowledged that. We would have expected a ""Thank You, see u again."" , rather than such a demanding attitude.

My only minor complaint is that the very polite, well-intentioned front desk staff was always a chore to deal with for two reasons: 1) their English skills were VERY limited, and I say this not as some ""dumb American"" expecting everyone else to speak English -- I have studied and speak three foreign languages fluently myself, but not Japanese -- but as someone expecting that any hotel in the cosmopolitan, business-central Ginza District would be aware that a vast majority of guests from around the world might ONLY have English as a common communication means between each other...and 2) they were unaware of and ill-equipped to answer what I saw as some of the most common, basic tourist questions (i.e. how subway fares are purchased, where to catch a hop-on-hop-off tour bus, where the closest conveyor belt sushi restaurant is, how to get to a major performing arts center, or how to buy tickets for the Tokyo Sky Tree attraction). Almost every question I posed was greeted first by a blank stare and then 10-15 minutes of 2-3 desk staff people scurrying around doing research on the Internet and printing out useless pages of information. At one point, they even suggested I ask my questions to the neighborhood 7-Eleven!?

1657,"Superb location in Ginza,which just one block behind Matsuya. For stations, easily reached from Ginza and Higashi Ginza. Small building but once you entered, well designed lobby, two smoothly working elevators, and the rooms are spacious compared to the other same level hotels in Ginza, especially the bathroom! Breakfast also was good with choice of Japanese and western. However, for staying more than 3 days, maybe you will have the 4th breakfast outside the hotel. Overall great hotel and will stay again here for sure!","December 30, 2016","31    Solaria nishitetsu hotel Ginza

1658,"Have stayed in Ginza three times and this is the best value budget/mid range (for Ginza!) hotel I have stayed in. Bigger than average rooms, fantastic location for Ginza station (exit A13) and Higashi Ginza Station (exit A2) and close to everything you need. Great restaurants a short walk away. and Tsukiji market just a 10 min walk down the road.Excellent reception staff.","December 22, 2016","31    Solaria nishitetsu hotel Ginza

1659,"The room is spacious when you compare with other hotels in Japan. And, it's location is perfect as it's only few minutes to nearby metro stations. As this trip is mainly for shopping & eating, I have lots of choices at nearby department stores & restaurants.Moreover, it's only 10-15 minutes walking distance to Tsukiji Market. Staff at front desk can speak English well that communication is not a problem at all.I will definitely recommend this hotel to my friends & will stay again next time in Tokyo.","December 18, 2016","31    Solaria nishitetsu hotel Ginza

1660,Quiet location within Ginza close to all the shopping and excellent restaurants. The room is comfortable and well appointed though typically small. Has free wifi TV and the usual mod cons. The hotel has excellent English speaking service. Checkout is 11 AM and when we arrived they allowed us to check in at 1PM though usually its 3 PM,"November 14, 2016","31    Solaria nishitetsu hotel Ginza

1661,"Hotel location is very convenient and located in the pricey side of the city. 3 mins walk to Mitsukoshi Nihonbashi department store where the food court down on level B1 was fantastic and not to be missed. The room is clean but small which I guess is very typical in Tokyo. One thing that bothered me a little is the toilet in the bathroom, the flush is not very powerful due to the effort of water conservation but it can cause problems because we ended up having to flush multiple times. The front desk staffs speak adequate English, we didn't have any issue with communicating.","November 10, 2016","31    Solaria nishitetsu hotel Ginza

1662,"I've been to Tokyo a couple of times now, and I've come to conclusion that my favorite place to stay is at Solaria Hotel Ginza. Not only is it in the middle of Ginza, but it is affordable, highly maintained, and also walking distance to the Tokyo Metro. ","November 5, 2016","31    Solaria nishitetsu hotel Ginza

1663,"Stayed for three nights. Excellent comfortable beds and good pillows. Great bathtub that came with various bath salts and stuff. Clean and well maintained. Front staff with limited English but trying their best.Room Japanese size smallish but OK (if a bit tight) with two giant suitcases and two people in twin room. Silent hotel and silent ac/heating.So so breakfast with somewhat limited selection (eg one black tea and one green and 650 Yen for a cappuccino) However the croissants require special mentioning as they were really really good.Many free umbrellas for borrow in the reception. When travelling to the airport (both) the closest metro is only 30 m from the hotel entrance just outside the Family Mart which is extremely convenient.The ice cream/cake parlour ""Celi"" on the corner opposite is worth a visit.Would stay again.","November 1, 2016","31    Solaria nishitetsu hotel Ginza

1664,"I needed to stay in Ginza due to work but I also wanted to be on a budget and I found Solaria for about $150/night. In Japan, there is a particular ""businessman's hotel"" which is sort of standardized. I guess you can consider it sort of like a hilton type model, as many of them are chains, however, Japanese standards are not like other standards, and these hotels are quite amazing and good and many of them are very well designed. They feel more like boutique hotels rather than a chain, especially the lobby and lounge areas. The only issue to watch out for is size of the rooms, but fortunately, Solaria was a totally normal sized room with a little sofa and desk area. Since I am only 5 feet tall, proportions don't matter as much to me, but I found this hotel quite adequate. both nights I had a bath in the very deep tubs and I found the hotel room bright and quiet. This hotel comes with the standard amenities of a business hotel (meaning, everything!!!) bath salts, toothbrushes, shampoos, and a million other amenities you probably didn't realize you needed in the bathroom. I did not eat the breakfast, but instead walked straight to tsujiki which is only about 10 minutes away for 830 am sushi and walked the markets. The hotel location is actually quite quite fabulous. very close to ginza train stations which there are several options, and about 900 yen taxi ride to Tokyo station. It's just removed from all the hustle and bustle of ginza, yet still extremely convenient. Mitsukoshi department store is right next door where you can go to the food halls in the basement(everyone needs to experience a department store food hall once in japan) and have some amazing local snacks and my fave stationary store K.itoya is close. There is a starbucks on every corner but there are also many better cafe's open (just not all of them open at 7 which is what I needed).","October 30, 2016","31    Solaria nishitetsu hotel Ginza

1665,This hotel is well located and easy to access from most areas. Only one restrarunt but plenty around. Room clean and service staff great and helpful. There were a little thrown when two women wanted to sleep in a double bed. It is also disappointing that if you arrive before 3 and your room is ready they expect a fee.Otherwise I would recommend it,"October 22, 2016","31    Solaria nishitetsu hotel Ginza

1666,"Visited Tokyo in June. Very near the train station but other reviewers are correct - if you have luggage, use the exit with the elevator which is across the street from the hotel. You will have to roll all your luggage to cross the street then walk a little to get to the street of the hotel; it was really manageable. And coming from Haneda, the train stops in Ginza, no transfers. The fare was ¥610.Reserved 3 rooms for our family w/ bfast for 2 per room. Upon check in, without any prodding, the staff offered that the 2 kids with us would get free bfast. At bfast the next day, they didn't honor that, as in they acted like we were lying so since we didn't want to argue anymore we just signed for the kids. It took the front desk a day to tell us that they couldn't do anything as the owner of the Cafe is different from the owner of the hotel and they have their own rules. Huh??? Different policy for the Hotel Cafe??? So go figure haha. Anyway, the simple bfast was okay and filling even if it was the same the whole 6 days we were there - the breads were really good specially the mini chocolate Danish. Apart from the breakfast ""misunderstanding"", our stay at the hotel was good. The rooms were clean and we really liked the bathroom - others reviewers were right, the bathroom took up maybe 1/3 of the room so it was really comfortable. Rooms and bathrooms were very clean. The washroom at the lobby was even nicer than the one in the room - it was fully automatic in the same way as toilets in Japan but as you open the door, the toilet seat goes up. In the guest area downstairs there are also 2 computers with printer for the guests, as well as brochures and other tour pamphlets in English. You can also borrow umbrellas from the front desk.Behind the hotel is a shop which sells Yoga gear (I can't remember the name) and their bags are really nice. There was a Family Mart around the corner and a big drugstore that closes late and some vendo machines scattered around the hotel. You won't get hungry in that area, there are so many restaurants surrounding the hotel, like at least 2 per street (there's Japanese, Italian, Ramen, steak etc). There's a McDonald's 2 blocks away below Mercure Hotel, a Starbucks a few minutes from Solaria, a Lawson plus the Ramen restaurant right in front of the hotel. There are also 3 department stores in Ginza, we ate twice at Mitsukoshi, both at Japanese restaurants and both were really good. You can walk to all the shops in Ginza, everything is there. Aside from all the luxury brands and chain brands, there's a big music store - Yamaha near Zara and H&M. I think it has 12 floors and it had everything, guitars, straps, all sizes of amplifiers, music books. We only reached until the 3rd floor and we were there for more than 2 hours already. There's a money changer in Ginza at a building called Ginza Core, I think it's World Currency on the 5th floor of that bldg. Also, in case you need extra luggage and don't want to spend on expensive ones, they sell hard case luggage on the ground floor for only ¥5400, 3 sizes and different colors for the same price. Still on the ground floor, there's a store - Zoff - that's sells eyeglasses and sunglasses without or with prescription which you can claim 30 minutes to an hour after they check your eyes. The cheapest pairs, if I remember right, are sold for ¥7000 which includes prescription. They also make those with progressive ones but it will take more than a day. Tsukiji Market is also near the hotel, some family members walked there to eat and it took them 10 minutes. It's also just 1 station away from Ginza. Kabukiza Theatre is also just a little further down the street, with coffee shops on the ground floor while waiting for the show to start. ","September 9, 2016","31    Solaria nishitetsu hotel Ginza
