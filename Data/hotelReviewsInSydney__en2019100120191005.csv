0,"I didn’t expect too much and mainly booked this as I wanted an Accor hotel near Darling Harbour (we’re Accor Plus members). I was actually really impressed! The lady on check-in was very friendly and helpful with our booking as it was a bit complicated because we had a second room for family on our booking, who were then staying on longer than us. She totally understood, and provided excellent service, with a smile!The room was huge, we were upgraded to one with two big windows overlooking Darling Harbour! It had a lounge and table too, and the bathroom was surprisingly modern. We were given a bottle of red wine as well as our usual two welcome drinks from the bar!The main bar area and restaurant were huge and had great views of Darling Harbour, a nice vibe at sunset too with happy hour. The only negatives were: - Huge rooms but only a Queen sized bed, it felt so small when we’re used to a King at home. - The water pressure in the shower was terrible, it was like a drizzle at best. Thank you for a great stay, highly recommend!","July 13, 2019","0    Novotel Sydney on Darling Harbour

4,"We had booked into the Ibis on Darling Harbour for a two night stay and when we arrived we had been Upgraded to the Novotel next door. What a wonderful surprise. We had the best time. Used the Light Rail to get around to the Lyric Theatre at the Casino to see Muriel's Wedding, The Musical. Fantastic show, enjoyed it so much, it's all about Australians in the 21st Century. Also used the Ferry to get to Circular Quay, great trip. The Hotel had the best breakfast and very comfortable. So easy to get around Sydney from Darling Harbour. We had an interconnecting door through to our Son and Daughter-in-law in the next room, just wonderful.","July 2, 2019","0    Novotel Sydney on Darling Harbour

10,"Attending a business meeting at the Novotel and although I stay regularly in Sydney for business and leisure opted for the convenience of staying in the same location as I was travelling with others. Upgraded to a beautiful view but this didn't make up for the filthy bathroom and room. It was confronting to shower and use the bathroom sink with dirty stains and black mould. The staff delightful, meals and restaurant service fantastic just a shame I won't be staying again due to the cleanliness of the room.","June 21, 2019","0    Novotel Sydney on Darling Harbour

11,"Booked for dinner, and the attitude of some members of the staff was putrid.The food was served minus serving spoon & a supervisor when told said we could use the same spoon given for rice for the other dish.After dinner we went to the bar to order coffee and drinks and the barman was rude, insollent, and totally unprofessional. He filled the coffee cup which over flowed and when he was ask to wipe the side, he responded in the most negative manner, as if service was done from a wayside cart in Vietnam or India, with residue of liquid around the cup and not clean.Certainly training and supervision is essential.","June 18, 2019","0    Novotel Sydney on Darling Harbour

14,"Being an Accor cardholder does not matter much in this hotel. You are not given priority and as a matter of fact transferred to a TRAINEE that took the longest time before our booking was confirmed. Before arriving I did the online check in that assured us that we can do an early check in and that the key was ready. Lo and behold, it was NOT. I was hoping this would make things more efficient as we needed to rush to a workshop upon arrival but we were made to WAIT. Further to this, when my key was not working, my registered room mate went down to have it changed. She was denied a key because it has to be me to have the key changed. What is the use of registering a room mate?! Breakfast is also a nightmare. The lines to the elevator is sooo long and when you reach the cafe, you still have to line up. Way too many people that the hotel can handle. Frankly this is disappointing. Further our package that was delivered to the hotel was brought to our room without our permission. Is that even correct? Shouldn't this be left at the front desk where we claim it? The only bright shining moment for this hotel is Charlie of concierge who graciously carried our baggage to and from our room with a smile. That's about it. ","June 14, 2019","0    Novotel Sydney on Darling Harbour

16,"It was my first stay at Novotel Darling harbour after many times visiting Sydney.The location was perfect. Harbourside shopping centre at doorstep, cocklebay wharf with many choices of dining. Barely 5 min walk the ferry to Circular Quay and onwards to other destinations. The hotel itself. The staff are super friendly and welcoming. They gave me a welcome bottle of wine upon check in as it was my birthday.The breakfast had a good variety of hot and continental options.We had an Executive Harbour View Room, the first thing you see as you walk through the door is the amazing view of Darling Harbour, the sky scrapers of CBD.Good size room and clean decent size bathroom with variety of amenities.Over had an amazing experience and definitely be back here when visiting Sydney in the future.

19,"If you can overlook a pretty basic check in & check out experience, the room was fantastic! I was in room 530 looking out directly over Darling Harbour. I arrived at night & the lights as I opened the door were breathtaking (not so great a view through the dirty window in daylight, but nevertheless, iconic Sydney!). The room was clean & well appointed - gowns & slippers too. Room service costs were reasonable & were the same price as the dining room (delivery fee only if you spend under $9.50). Bed very comfortable, great amenities...free wifi if you’re an Accor member. Concierge offered to get me a flat rate ‘car’ to the airport for $50. (On the way in, it was $55 in a taxi around 9pm at night). The flat rate was worth it on the way back to the airport as there was a traffic deadlock. I appreciated them suggesting it. Entry to the Hotel is unusual in that you come into a very small crowded & unwelcoming entry area with a concierge who immediately tells you you have to go up either escalators of lift to 1st floor to checkin...not very appealing.I stayed at this hotel in the early 1990s and it was top class and state of the art. Now it is just another hotel as there are lots of nice ones around. Whilst I found checkin staff & concierge service lacking, the bar staff, room service staff were great and after checking in and arriving at my room, I was prompted to complete a checkin survey. I did this & got a rapid response which was admirable.Be wary of comparable value for money, but overall, at this Novotel, the quality of the room and fantastic location makes this worthy of the 4 stars","June 7, 2019","0    Novotel Sydney on Darling Harbour

30,I stayed here for one night for a work trip. We arrived and found that the person at work who had done the booking had got the date wrong. Thankfully the service was really wonderful and the team not only managed to rebook for us but we got it cheaper than the original booking. They also brought us coffee while we waited which was much appreciated given the early flight we'd been on. The room itself was roomy and comfortable and very clean. Only minor complaint from me was the bar wasn't open when we returned at 11.30pm in the evening which was a shame. Great location as well. ,"May 24, 2019","0    Novotel Sydney on Darling Harbour

31,"My husband and I roadtriped from Melbourne to Sydney for the weekend. We decided to stay at the Novotel based on reviews and location. We didn’t have any sort of expectations upon arriving at the hotel.Unfortunately for us, it was the little things that mattered that didn’t make it feel like the “fantastic experience” it should have been.Check-in was fast, the lady that served us was lovely. The room was really spacious and clean. We were staying in the 3rd floor and had the view of Harbourside Shopping Centre. The fact that it was connected to the shops was a massive thumbs up!There were two things my husband and I really wanted when we walked into our room was, toothbrushes/toothpaste and drinking water. Neither of these things were available READY in our room.We saw two bottles of water in the mini-bar but noticed it was not marked with a marker or sticker so we assumed it was complimentary. Apparently not. Only found out when we checked-out. I also thought it was bizarre that the dental kit wasn’t already available in our rooms. Had to call room service, which isn’t an issue, but it’s those little things that matter.The other thing we thought was that the parking within the hotel should have been complimentary with our stay...The hotel was lovely, the team are lovely...unfortunately with other choices in the Darling Harbour area, we will not be returning anytime soon to Novotel for the little things that matter to us.

33,"I joined the Accor Plus program in 2018 and needed to use my complimentary night. I really though the program was a gimmick and was just keen on not throwing my membership away.We stayed on a Wednesday night and the experience was first class from the time we pulled into the driveway to ask for directions to parking. From there, it stayed as you would expect of a hotel of the Novotel's calibre.We stayed in a harbour facing room on the third floor and the room was well laid out and the view was fantastic. The only minor negatives were a slight smell of wet carpet and the shower recess needed a bit of detailing. Otherwise, great room, great bed. You need to like big fat pillows though, because if you don't, bring your own.I had initially planned at eating at one of the tourist-trap restaurants around darling harbour but hadn't read one decent review for any of them.We were recommended the in-house restaurant the Ternary by a staff member, as they should and I'm so glad we took up the offer. We were entitled to a heavy discount with our membership, but even without that I would have been more than happy with the food quality and quantity for the price. A great meal indeed.So without having to wander from the hotel, we had great food, great drinks, great accommodation and a fantastic view. There is an amazing seating area with ethanol fires and the hotel stay was a fantastic experience.If you get a call from Accor Plus team and are a regular traveller, it isn't a gimmick. With the complimentary drinks, discounted dining and room discounts you will more than get your membership back in a few rewarding stays.Breakfast is the most comprehensive buffet I've seen.","May 16, 2019","0    Novotel Sydney on Darling Harbour

Clearly, there must be turnover off staff and perhaps a bit more focus on training might remedy some of the below par service. With the addition of the Sofitel Hotel, Accor has a full hand of hotels, Sofitel, Novotel and Ibis located close to each other. Not sure if this is a sound strategy but no doubt Accor Group has thought this through. The Novotel Darling Harbour is well established and presents well. Worth a stay.","May 4, 2019","0    Novotel Sydney on Darling Harbour

43,"First time in Sidney, we stayed here with family and not disappointed...It is located right within Darling Harbour area, so you get all the area has to offer, entertainments, foods, shopping, sceneries, the hardrock cafe is just next door, along with pubs and restaurant..excellent locationAirport taxi took you aprox 30 mins, cost around $50 .. the hotel is also located on top of Light Train Station "" The Convention"" it connect you with the main Train Station ""The Central"" also if you chose ferry, this hotel pretty much next door to the ""Pyrmont Bay"" so this location give you very easy access to go anywhere i Sidney using Ferry, Train , Light Train and Bus.. btw the ""Train"" is equivalent to MRT or Subway as in Hongkong, Japan or Singapore.. except the Train in Sidney is nicer.. they are double decker train, with seating arrangement just like a regular train ..unlike those typical MRT / subway side seated style with fiberglass long chairs - see my pics To take the Train, Light Train, Bus and Ferry you need to purchase an ""Opal Card"" just like any other regular MRT card, this is a top up value card, BUT unlike other country, the balance in Opal card can not be refunded.. so it stays in the card, and they can not be used to pay for purchase at merchants either.. so for visitor and tourist, this can be annoying that you can not take your balance back and you dont know when to comeback.. so its kinda a waste of money..Oo also, it doesn't work nationally .. we travel to Melbourne.. and they use different payment system on their transportation lines, Opal card is not accepted .. this is what i ""hate"" about transport line in Australia.. also the mapping signage inside the lines are not effective.. you have to keep asking the staff in the station especially hub station like ""Central"", of where to go, what exit to take to connect with other lines etc... i hope they can improve this.. but the staff are always around and very helpful, nice and friendly..Back to the hotel, all are perfect, staff are typically Australian who are friendly and helpful, the lobby are homey and warm, rooms are in big size, the twin back can accomodate 4 asian size adults, so in my case we travelled with 2 kids.. the twin beds are fits..Perhaps they only need to improve the wifi access, they limit access to 3 devices only.. nowadays when you travel with family.. every member has gadget and everyone desperately need wifi access, so this is the hassle.. also they charge wifi access for $10 but this can be managed by registering yourself to IHG member and they waived the wifi fee .. but it's a lame marketing attempt i might say, sorry.. :-)Overall, happy to comeback here..

45,"I got a room with the harbour view and it was amazing to be able to watch the fireworks from my room. The room itself is spacious and comfortable but a little dated, like the rest of the building. The sound-proofing is terrible and I can hear other guests walking and talking about the corridor as well as doors opening and slamming. There is a shopping centre and many restaurants conveniently located very near the hotel but the nearest train/subway station is about 10-15 minutes walk away and the nearest bus stop is about 5-7 minutes. Overall the hotel was less than what I expected but I still had an enjoyable stay.","April 29, 2019","0    Novotel Sydney on Darling Harbour

46,"I still had a great stay at this hotel but it could have been so much better. I had requested an early check in but the room wasn’t ready when I arrived. They said the manager would call me to let me know when it was but they never did. When I finally checked for the 3rd time after the standard check in time I finally got the room. The room was really nice and worth the wait but the sofa bed wasn’t made up. Whilst this was being fixed I examined the room and noticed the top of the wardrobe had around half of an inch of dust and other parts of the room could have been a lot cleaner. Whilst on cleanliness, the shaded area near the pool looked like it hadn’t been cleaned for several days and the tent fabric itself was dirty and mouldy.The room was set up for 2 people, so two chairs, glasses and towels etc when they knew there were 3 people staying. The room was serviced everyday but none of the small items were replaced like tea bags etc. There were just so many small things that had a slight negative affect on the overall trip.Saying all of the above, I still had a good time. The location is amazing, the staff are friendly despite the issues and it was good value for money for the Easter weekend.I would return but hopefully some more TLC has been put in before then.","April 25, 2019","0    Novotel Sydney on Darling Harbour

49,I booked this hotel for a work event. It was close to the venue and quite pricey but I thought it would be worth it. Unfortunately I was wrong. The room was microscopic and for $450 looked over a laneway and the backs of old apartment buildings. Terrible! The rooms was so small that even the work desk was a half size to make the room seem normal size. On check in I was presented with a welcome gift. Imagine my disappointment to discover it was a bottle of water in a bag. You can drink the tap water in Sydney - so why? Waste of plastic and dashed expectations.

The rest of the staff, one woman in particular ignored us until we came up to the counter right in front of her! The room itself was great, plenty of space and clean. The cleaners however, not sure what they were supposed to service daily but the rubbish was never taken out, the room was not tidied. It seems they only changed out the towels and made beds. They also serviced the apartment late in the day which made it rather annoying having come back to the room after a days shopping etc.Overall the experience was good, only wish the cleaners were up to the same standard.Ps.

89,"I've stayed at the Meriton Zetland on many occasions. I like the fact that you can park your car (at a reasonable cost) and can simply walk to a nearby restaurant or shop at Coles if you would prefer to cater for yourself. Apartment rooms are clean, spacious and supplied with everything you could need. Not the best location for public transport but not the worst either. Staff are always helpful & courteous and even the housekeeping staff greet you with a smile and a hello. Some of the rooms can be quite noisy but this is generally a result of the freeway nearby and noise from people on the streets below. The hotel does seem to be becoming popular for large numbers of people booking in to 'socialise' in apartments, but thankfully this hasn't been an issue for us personally. The apartments are all of a different configuration which is not always ideal. We have stayed in studio, one bedroom and 2 bedroom apartments and we've have had some lovely quiet & spacious rooms with great views, but also some apartments that are quite small and not so quiet. I always request a room in a quiet part of the hotel away from the freeway but of course this can't be guaranteed. I will certainly continue to stay at Meriton Zetland.","June 12, 2019","1    Meriton Suites Zetland

Paper thin walls, could hear pub noise from across the street until early hours of the morning and the room was too hot despite using the air con (had to close the balcony door due to street noise). Not a refreshing night's sleep. The room was tastefully decorated and it was clean. Bathroom and shower were good too. However, we expected more as most of the tripadvisor reviews were great.

I sent a few emails and the replies were quick and detailed2. rooms - spacious enough, clean, comfortable beds3. wifi is strong, for 3 devices4. good location - just walk down the street and turn left for Hungry Jacks, Oporto and IGA and ALDI for groceries.

141,"More training needed. Select your BEST people and train the rest to be of the same standard.Breakfast people were just pleasant. They needed to wow people so that it starts there day. Service is OK, One girl never even spoke to the people at breakfast. There were more guests speaking to each other making each other welcome. YOUR staff should also be doing that. NOT just going through the motions and come over false. Problems like this can come from the management. the management can overpressure staff and the staff come over as they are not happy. I hope this helps. The Cambridge is bordering on 5 star and with more passion from the staff it could be 10 star !!!!!!!.That is outstanding/excellent/5 star.

The service at the hotel, however, during breakfeast and dinner was not good at all. Tables where dirty; was very difficult to get attention of staff.One of reasons why I choose the hotel was the roof top pool. During most of the stay, there was a problem with the pool so the pool was closed but also the roof top area where one could sit outside was closed. No apologies from the team when asking only blunt answer that there was a problem that needed fixing.Overall...not a hotel I would recommend.","February 28, 2019","3    Vibe Hotel Rushcutters Bay Sydney

So what you pay in extra rent compared to other hostels you probably make up from the free dinner/alcohol. There are many reception staff, all of who have been incredibly friendly and accommodating to my man requests.

Daily group activities which make it easy to meet others. Staff is a big part of why I stayed for over a month. Cedric took the time to tell me non touristy things to do and places to go escape the crowds. Sofie and Wilma led us on a few fun nights out. Laura, Alba, Mena, and Ana were always beyond helpful at the front.","April 29, 2019","4    Wake Up! Sydney

If you get the right times without too much people around, the kitchen and bathroom are also very good. When you don't want to go out at night, then you can chill out at the 1st floor next to the kitchen.All in all a good hostel.","April 28, 2019","4    Wake Up! Sydney

260,"Came down to Sydney from Phoenix, AZ for Mardi Gras weekend and had a very positive first-time hostel experience at Wake Up! Sydney. I really like how my room had a locker that was big enough to fit my rollerboard and backpack. It gave me a piece of mind knowing that my stuff was locked away while I was out exploring the city. The men's bathroom was clean and the showers were very spacious. The water got hot enough where I could shave my beard. Beds were comfy and I was able to sleep (luckily because no one in my room snored) and I did not think it was too hot to sleep at night. Special shoutout to Alba at the front desk for leading the city tour guide on Thursday AM. She took us to some really cool spots like the botanic gardens and Darling Harbor. I like how she took us to a food court for lunch that gave a discount for Wake Up! guests. I think it was 8.50 AUD for any sandwich and a drink. I had the chicken snitzel and it was so good. Also, thank you Alba for checking me out and giving me a coupon for a free cup of coffee at the cafe since I had an early AM flight back to LAX. I would def. come again. Love the night club in the basement and how the hostel is right near the central station. The entire staff was very kind and helpful. I also like how the hostel had a lot of freebies and events to mingle with other backpackers every day of the week. Wi-Fi could be faster. -Walter","March 9, 2019","4    Wake Up! Sydney

261,"This hostel was super easy to find, just outside of the central station a very short walk! The location is also great for getting anywhere in Sydney (walking distance) there was good wifi all throughout the hostel reaching the rooms. Daily house keeping also came to empty bins and give the rooms a quick clean which was great. They always had some plans organised in the evenings such as wine and cheese nights, pizza nights and also organised events in the side bar such as silent discos etc so there was always something to do and great opportunities to meet people. The rooms were nice and big, quiet at night, lockers were a bit of an odd shape but still big enough for most important things. The kitchen also had lots of utensils and equipment for cooking (would recommend just giving them a rinse before use as some people didnt wash up properly) and plenty of fridges for food. The bathrooms were clean although the sinks were a bit loose. Good strong shower which i loved. There was also a laundry room with a dryer which was useful (one machine was broken but the cycles dont take long) lift was a bit slow but stairs also available.

I met some lovely people, had an issue with somebody sleeping in my bed one night but the man at reception was very friendly and sorted it straight away. I had a room on the first floor which was very noisy so not ideal if you’re looking to have an early night - the music can be heard until around 3am. Alba was great, she made an effort to learn my name and provided great service throughout my stay. Sometimes, staff at reception were slow with no apology given, but I understand that there’s a lot of people staying here so to be expected I suppose. The pub crawl on a Sunday was my favourite activity. Although the bars we were taken to were not great, it was good value for money with 3 drinks for $10. A good way to meet people.

Despite reading reviews beforehand of excessive noise coming from the club at nights, I was staying on the 3rd floor and didn’t hear a single bass or song so no complaints there.My only negative was the size of the kitchen which services the whole hostel! It often got extremely busy and you end up waiting around to cook for ages if you get there at the wrong time. It was clean though!Overall, it was a great first hostel, well kept and worth while for the slightly dearer price!

279,"The front desk lady Sarah was exceptionally helpful, patient and friendly. As we were arriving to Sydney an hour earlier from the standard check in time, she managed to arrange a room ready for us upon our arrival. As we arrived, as my 6 year old son went to collect the key from her with me, she realised the presence of little children, and rearranged another room for us as the one she had ready for us was right next to the lift, so may be a little dangerous for him. We ended up with a very quiet room in the end of the hall. We did not mind having to wait for another 20 min or so. She was also very patient with my millions of questions about everything with the car park, costs, internet and everything else. Always with a smile too! And she’s awesome with kids! Amazing staff they have! Their other staff members were lovely too.We were able to park our car at UTS car park securely, within walking distance for $20 per night. Not directly next to the hotel though.The room was neat and clean. All the basics were available. The choice of brand of shampoo, hand wash and soap was great, and they all had lovely scent.Their small bar fridge was filled with quite a range of drinks, which did filled up most of the space already before we were able to put more stuff in it.The laundry service was about $24 per load of their provided laundry bag, which was quite a good price compared to another hotel. We didn’t end up using this service though.The location of this hotel was great, walking distance to China town and Darling Harbour.Definitely will stay at this place again if we come to Sydney again.","January 3, 2019","5    Vulcan Hotel Sydney

281,"PROS:- With current exchange rates, we paid about $160 USD per night, which is not bad for a centrally-located hotel in a large city. - The room was quiet — I appreciated management’s admonition that they have a zero-tolerance noise policy. - Location was excellent and a good distance from the areas overrun with tourists to the north. A good spot for exploring Sydney, close to the restaurants in the Waterloo/Surry Hills/Darlinghurst area, and within walking distance of the Central train station and Circular Quay. - Restaurant was good for breakfast, staff was friendly. CONS:- For $160 USD per night, I expected it to be nicer. I don’t worry much about how a hotel room looks, but things like a chair with a seat cushion that didn’t match, a cheap wire cart in the bathroom, etc. made it look shabby. - The room had zero dresser drawers — a mini-bar and fridge took up the space where they should have been, which made it challenging to unpack. - The chain lock on the door was installed backwards, which made it useless. There was no other safety measure — the door didn’t even have a deadbolt, just a push-button lock. - On another security note, when we stored our luggage prior to checking in, they just gave us a key to a closet down the hall that had everyone’s luggage in it. We could easily have stolen items from someone else’s bags. ","November 30, 2018","5    Vulcan Hotel Sydney

Upon reservation we did not know Sydney, but we soon found out that the location was great! 10 minutes walk to Central Station, walking distance to Darling Harbor as well as to CBD.

They greeted everyone like a friend and took the time out of their busy day to have a quick chat. I had the pleasure of meeting the owners who are amazing. They are very dedicated to ensuring everyone has exceptional service and a memorable stay at the hotel.I agree with everyone else the breakfast were amazing and the coffee exquisite (high praise coming from a self confessed coffee snob)I was introduced to the dumpling/noodle restaurant the next block over that were handmade and very delicious. They are open late too.I would strongly recommend them as they are very central and it was easy for the Uber drivers to pickup/drop off right outside the hotel due to the loading bay on Mary Ann St.,"October 22, 2018","5    Vulcan Hotel Sydney

288,"I stayed at "" Vulcan Hotel "" during my stay in Sydney ( from 13th - 17th.Sep.'18 ). It's really a wonderful hotel which exceeded my expectations and I can recommend this hotel to all the people who would like to visit Sydney. The reasons as follows. (1).The hotel is conveniently located near the Central Station where is about a fifteen minutes' walk to the station. (2).The hotel is convenient place for shightseeing because their location is close to the heart of city. (3).The area of the room is not so large, however, it's large enough for almost all of the people. The structure of the room is very functional and a quiet desigh. The room has been always kept clean condition and I could enjoy relaxed atmosphere. (4).The staff of hotel are very friendly and capable persons, therefore, they responded quickly and appropriate ato my requirement. (5).The breakfast is absolutely delicious. Possibly someone think the price of the breakfast is a little bit high, however, I think that it is very reasonable, considering its excellent quality.

My main purpose of visiting Sydney in this time was to participate in the "" Sydney Marathon 2018 "" (42.195km) which was held on 16th.Sep.'18 and I finished a race ; besids, I broke my previous best record for the full marathon. Thanks to their support, I achived my objective which I finished the Sydney Marathon.

We had a very warm welcome. Our room was spotless and the bathroom had a 3 tier trolley as well as 2 decent sized shelves. Very thoughtful. We were on the bottom floor with a window into a beautiful seating area. Our room was very dark, which meant we slept in, and we needed to have the light on the whole time but we weren’t there during the day, and the big window overlooking the lush green garden area made up for it.

294,"I did research on best place to stay within walking distance of city and public transport and Sydney Uni. The Vulcan was best value and had positive reviews. The room was small with two single beds but was adequate for what we wanted during a conference. I'd definitely recommend it to others as I arranged an Opal card for the week (from interstate) but only used the card once. Walked up to Circular Quay via Hyde Park and onto the oversea ship terminal on the first day. Then home to The Vulcan again down George Street. an easy walk. That afternoon walked to Sydney University which was just under 1.5 kms. Good flat walking, well lit at night. Loved the café in the hotel. Good breakfast menu. Delicious pizzas at night. Order beforehand is best. Bed and pillow comfy, rooms cleaned well each day. Best of all the whole place was so friendly and welcoming, a distinct contrast to the big hotel chains. Staff were so friendly and so efficient.

The owners (I’m guessing) presided over breakfast and were so friendly and accommodating. Without a doubt what sets the Vulcan apart was all the little thoughtful touches and friendly, professionalism. Not to mention, the Vulcan was SO affordable and amazing value!!!

300,"Got to love a hotel which advertises its rooms for single travellers as 'shoe box'! It was just that, a thee-quarter bed, quite a bit of roaming around room, a spacious bathroom, a wardrobe, a TV ... what more do you want? I checked in quite late on a Saturday night, and found a terrifically helpful front desk person who sold me a very reasonably priced drink to take to my room. My room had lovely high ceilings, a very comfy bed, all the doings in the bathroom, and quick and efficient check-out. For the price ($145 a night, in Sydney - amazing), I can totally recommend this quirky little hotel. It is in fact walking distance to Central Station, and a bit of a long stroll to the CBD, but doable. I wake up if a sparrow farts, truly, and on a busy Sydney road, I slept like a baby, heard nothing. The bathroom could do with a bit of spruce up, the tiles a little bit grotty, but hey, so are mine at home! I'll be back!","May 3, 2018","5    Vulcan Hotel Sydney

I prefer #103 due to it's larger bathroom.Pros: 1) Possibly the BEST breakfast in ALL of SYDNEY!!!!!! 2) an AMAZING international staff that was patient, pleasant & kind. ** A special ""thank you"" to Rose-Croatian lady at the front desk who was extremely pleasant & always with a smile, Livia is also at the front desk, she is half Brit/half Romania was helpful and polite, Raj-the Nepalese chef & Yves-the French waiter who patiently took our breakfast orders and didn't need reminders of my favs.3) They allowed us to use the courtyard for our daily yoga classes4) Wifi5) Hot water (for showers)6) iron & ironing board was availableCons: 1) restaurant/kitchen closed for dinner/drinks2) no gym3) unable to get currency exchanged (unless the owner is present)4) no door/step down to shower (in room 103), prevent a flood with 2 bath mats5) no towels were given for our beach visit*** If you're staying elsewhere in Sydney, please consider the breakfast at the Vulcan and try the cauliflower fritters, sautéed kale, avocado, mushrooms, tomatoes. The banana bread was good too (big slices).","November 22, 2017","5    Vulcan Hotel Sydney

322,"We visited the Vulcan Hotel on a short trip to Sydney. As per previous reviews the location is quite good for trains, Darling Harbour and Chinatown. However, this is where any positive experience ends. We paid a high price in advance specifically for a twin room. On arrival we were told there was none available and on asking if there was any way this could be resolved we were informed that a rollout bed would be available at a significant extra cost. The room itself was tiny despite booking a superior twin. We had to move the armchair into the corridor to have any room to move around the bed.see pics attached. We found the staff to be extremely unhelpful, uninterested in customer service and patronising. Despite this extremely poor hotel and attitude Sydney is well worth a visit just don't stay in #Vulcan Hotel if you want any customer care.","November 16, 2017","5    Vulcan Hotel Sydney

323,"Stayed in October 2017. Hotel is noisy. Attempts have been made to sound proof but you hear road noise, adjoining bathroom and corridor noise. No duvets on beds in direct contradiction to management provided photos. For over $200 a night not really good value. You don’t get much either. Cheap towels, cheap toiletries. Nothing is particularly good. Location is really the only thing and that’s only good if you’re visiting the university. Tries to give a family feel but the reality is it’s just a bit crummy and overpriced. Heritage hotel is code for ‘noisy and old’. Bathroom is so small you can hardly move. Overall not good.

The reason we choose this hotel was the closeness to central station about 100 yds away so we could walk to the train for our onward trip to Richmond.

This hotel has been recently refurbished and it was done to a really good standard.The bed was comfortable, everything in the room worked (no - this is not a strange thing to say here - I often find hotel fittings that don't work!); and my No. 1 quality test - the iron and ironing board were all of good quality.The location in George St. is directly adjacent to Central Station, so access to both the domestic and international airport is really easy. There is plenty of eateries nearby - the small Doner Kebab place over the road does a wonderful selection of eats. If you need a quick cheap breakfast, there is a McDonalds over the road too.Friendly staff, nice surroundings and surprisingly good value for Sydney. Well done Mercure team.

332,"First time to Australia, spent seven days in Sydney at the Mercure. We had two rooms. Rooms are very clean and tidy. No clutter or anything overly done. We did use the sauna and pool one night. They were fine and not necessarily anything fancy about them. Son used the exercise room and he said it was adequate. Again we spent more time sightseeing then being in our room. But when we were, it was perfect. Hot showers, clean and comfortable.The staff are wonderful, I mean wonderful. They are attentive, helpful, friendly and will go the extra mile for you. Cannot praise them enough and that goes along long ways with me. That tells me they care and enjoy working at The Mercure.Restaurant for breakfast was good food, but a bit pricey. Otherwise a wide variety to choose from as it a buffet only. Bar was great. Quiet in the sense of being able to carry on a conversation and being heard by at our table. Drinks were great and the staff talked about local brews and made a great Gin and Tonic. That’s my drink. Local gin, Tom’s something. Was very good. Location was perfect. Next to Central Station for the train and bus depot. You couldn’t ask for anything better. Walking distance to Chinatown and Darling Harbour. Very convenient to all the sites we were set to see.Certainly would highly recommend to anyone going to Sydney. ","June 27, 2019","6    Mercure Sydney

They are incredibly helpful and welcoming. Esther as the front desk was fabulous for my multiple check ins and different charge types that I was dealing with (due to travel in and out of the city as well as different charges to different companies). Esther was helpful with my multiple bookings and arrival and departure dates.Extra Special mention for Katrina in the newly renovated 818 Restaurant on the first level. She along with the other team members were great to see each morning at breakfast. Always happy and always more than willing to assist. This team made my day each and every morning during my stay. Always greeting me with a smile and treating me as if I were a family member.The rooms are spacious and comfortable even for a long stay.....this of course is a matter of perspective.

339,"I was very lucky to win a 2 night stay at the Mercure in Central. I upgraded to the 12th floor and took advantage of a bigger room with some single lounge chairs. It was a lovely view of Central and suprisingly quite sound proof. The carpet was lovely, TV a good size, the bed was quite comfortable. A variety of pillows. I had the best sleep in a very long time. The curtains provided blockout. There was a safe, kettle, room for luggage, an office table, a cupboard for hanging up some clothes. Walking distance to the city centre, right next to a variety of buses to other locations and near Central train station which is the hub of all train destinations. The bathroom was just fine. The only small negative would be that there wasn't enough light for me. There were a couple tall lamps, some spotlights near the bed on each side as well as another light. Light in the hallway but actually not in the actual room itself. It was a bit too dark for me. The breakfast buffet had a variety to choose from and the ordered lattes were lovely. Newspapers were also available. Staff were very friendly and the parking onsight was great. Overall, this is a perfect affordable family stay in a city that can be top dollar expensive as you get closer to the harbour. I also think that the pastry chef must be very experienced because the croissants and the other breakfast desserts were amazing!","June 15, 2019","6    Mercure Sydney

340,"Despite being in a great location near Central station, this place was just average, and does not meet expectations for the price. The bed is uncomfortable and there is mot enough warm linen, only a thin doona and a blanket. The mattress is hard and the sheets scratchy. I could not turn on the heater as it only blew out dust and it affected my asthma badly. And the room was cold overnight. I am usually very hot in hotels but I actually went out to buy warmer clothes and flanelette pajamas. The ""energy saving"" lightglobes were useless and meant that I turned every light (and I mean every light) just to see clearly. The TV advertises that you can screen mirror from your device but that didn't work. Again, i was disappointed that another Australian hotel did not offer free wifi for guests. Seriously, i can get free wifi on a plane but have to pay $10 a day in a hotel on the ground!! Although the room was very clean, I accidentally broke a glass and called housekeeping to warn their staff of the hazard and was met with a very disinterested staff member. Breakfast was chaotic with staff insisting on ""seating"" guests leaving a line of people waiting, which was unnecessary. Staff seemed overwhelmed despite it catering for travel groups, air crews and conference guests. The food was adequate, the barista made coffee poor and there wasn't a cup nor tea available. I did like the ice tea and the fruit flavoured water. The bar staff were accommodating once you got their attention from cleaning. The dinner staff seemed to just manage.

341,"This hotel was a good hotel for easy access to public transportation around town. Nestled in the heart of the city, it was located in a very busy part of town, close to Spice Alley which is a hidden gem of the area for Asia cuisine. However, we found there was a lot of Asian cuisine around, and we’re glad when we finally found an absolutely fantastic Italian restaurant near the Spice Alley area, and I wish I could remember the name because it was the best food we ate there. Our room was kind of disappointing with nothing but a wall for a view, and WiFi was mediocre, but I’ve heard that’s an issue allover Sydney so I won’t fault the hotel. They had the traditional showers that have a small glass portion toward the shower head and a half glass shower door that swings inward and leaves the back half open. While traditional in most U.K. and British areas, I’m just not a fan of the open/drafty way these work. This is my personal opinion and I am sure will be just fine to most.The store was perfect for snacks and other amenities, and the restaurant had a good breakfast (I’m sure it had other good items for lunch and dinner but we only had breakfast). The best part of this hotel is its great location to the central station railway. It was easy to get all over town from Darling Harbor to the Opera House and the Harbor Bridge. It was fun to be around the hustle and bustle of the city. ","June 9, 2019","6    Mercure Sydney

350,The hotel is rated at 4 1/2 stars and I must at meet I was a little disappointed The location is great being right next to Central Station and walking distance to Chinatown but I little bit far from the CBD shopping of the high-end stores featuring Gucci Louie time deal and how must Having said that is easy override for only a few dollars to the top and of town First impression was sufficiently pleasant with a nice fire from efficient service although that difficulty finding our reservations as dad picked my wife's middle name as a surname but thank goodness they were alert enough to search brought enough to find a booking Rebel boy service is non-existent and older we had a big bag and I was clearly using my walking frame being a disabled person there was no assistance from anybody to take the bag for the family luckily the bag was on wheels Even after checking in and seeing that I was disabled there was no effort to make and take our bags to the room. Even after checking in and seeing that I was disabled there was no effort to make and take our bags to the roomThis is truly a non-for an half star ranking service This is truly a non-for an half star ranking service The rooms are adequate in size with I was being a double room with two double beds that all the basic amenities however the four of us there was insufficient soaps shampoos for us to use I requested more from the front desk but it took for ever to get up here and take it took almost 3 hours to get the toothbrushes which we also requested I had forgotten my shaving kit and requested that and it arrived just past midnight Room service was very apologetic and after the reminders the able to eventually organise themselves to bring up the shampoos shaving kit's  Located near the central railway station is the McCure hotel part of the equal chain which holes also the Sofitel Ibis Novatel Pullman hotels So there is no doubt there is great pedigree but this hotel for me it is 4 1/2 star rating was a bit disappointing  Chicken was pleasant and sufficiently efficient although they had difficulty finding the reservation as they have made the reservation under my wife's middle name rather than surname There is no concierge service and although it was clear that I was disabled using my walking frame nobody came to help with regards to the baggage we had Even after checking in and observing that I was disabled nobody made any effort to help take the bags from the reception to our rooms This is not what I expect from a 4 1/2 star hotel.  TWhat do you pay is what you gethe rooms are utilitarian and definitely are not of a high level of sophistication but is more than adequate and the double beds are really really comfortable with matching pillows being just as comfortable However the air conditioning in the room is really noisy but very efficient and cool the room down pleasantly fast Although the hotel has been in existence for some time and has been kept well and is pleasantly clean with no hint of Mustiness. The rate includes breakfast which is a buff a breakfast served at 818 platform restaurant on the first floor It's a buff a breakfast with all the usual scrambled eggs baked beans hashbrowns bacon and a large array of fruits she's in breads There is no egg cooking station and is available on order an extra cost Two fried eggs on omelette cost six dollars however you can get to post eggs for free a very strange system The bread to a fresh but the pastries had seen better days and a crumpet because available for toasting was really old and hard.  Tea and coffee available on a help yourself bases from the automated machine The quality is adequate but my wife did not agree with the quality of the coffee as the milk was not fresh but of a process variety.  Service was pleasant and professional and the floor manager took attention to my disability and provided us a table closer to the Buffy That was very kind of them but the waiting staff were a bit lazy and a branch and made very little effort to clear away the use plates from our table  Food quality was adequate with nothing to re-form about and quantity was sufficient but you have to be patient as it took their time to refill the dishes When I first went to the buffet The grilled tomato and sausage trees were empty and it took them at least half an hour to have them refilled again I ordered poached eggs and that also took forever for it to be served I suppose it was a Sunday and it was a full restaurant and they must've been very busy but the time it took for them to deliver the food was disappointingly slow  Rating at 4 1/2 stars I would've expected a higher quality and better fit out for the rooms and restaurant but the room rate including breakfast was just over $150 per night for the weekend which is really very cheap for Sydney and its location Like I Said what you pay is what you getsaid what you pay is what you get but this is more than adequate if all you want is accommodation,"May 25, 2019","6    Mercure Sydney

355,"I stayed here whilst attending a conference at the Novotel Sydney Central. The two nights I stayed here, I woke up at 1.00am and 2.00am respectively due to noise. The walls seem to be very thin here and it is very easy for people in rooms next door to unintentionally wake you. Also, if someone is smoking nearby, the smell drifts into your room. (This is a no smoking hotel so I understand this is the guests fault, not the hotels). The location is very close to Central train station. If you are a heavy sleeper, this may be the place for you. Staff were friendly and attentive. ","May 12, 2019","6    Mercure Sydney

357,"We have just returned from a very short but very special trip away. My sons 13th birthday was approaching and we decided to take him to a concert in Sydney. To sweeten the deal we searched for somewhere to stay overnight. The Mercure ticked the boxes, being central to everything, having a pool and offering breakfast. It had been some time since we had visited a larger chain motel, so I was hesitant, but so glad we did. I was blown away with the service and the entire exprience. From check in to check out, the friendliness professionalism from staff was exceptional. By request, we were upgraded to a slightly larger room which, I am certain that given the two teenagers, made the trip so much more enjoyable. We enjoyed a lovely pre-dinner drink in the Level 1 Bar and headed out to the concert. On returning, my son walked in to the room to find the sweetest card from reception, some slices of cake and an orange juice to help welcome him to the teenage years.We all experienced a sensational nights sleep and then enjoyed a delicious breakfast. Again the customer service and genuine friendliness was enough to make us want to return very soon (this time with all the kids).I highly recommend this for anyone needing a place to stay that is central, welcoming and worth the money. It is a fantastic spot to enjoy the city and all it has to offer and is well set up for children. Thank you Mercure. ","May 8, 2019","6    Mercure Sydney

365,"As a business hotel, this is a good option in central Sydney. Close to transport, fast checkin, friendly staff and onsite bar and restaurant. Rooms are dated but relatively comfortable. The rooms seem clean, however I had to move the bed to retrieve an item I had dropped and the space under the bed was really filthy. My biggest criticism is the utter lack of any decent lighting. There are some bedside lamps and a desk lamp as well as a wall light; however the lack of overhead lighting means the rooms are extremely dim and the lighting very poor. Perhaps not a huge criticism but significant for someone with vision needs. Anyway, my company continues to use this hotel and I appreciate the friendly staff, excellent buffet breakfast and central location.I suspect I will be back!","April 19, 2019","6    Mercure Sydney

We could hear the people and families from other rooms, when they went to bathrooms or were chatting, at every hours of the nights.

The welcome is so lovely - and the complimentary, freshly baked cookies and green apple were yum and most appreciated. The room is bright and roomy (2 king beds) and very comfortable. All the amenities you need. My only gripe is that the bar was closed when I came back at around 10:30 - which seems very early for a hotel bar? I got a glass of wine from room service but not the same (& not the best drop tbh!). It's a shame as there is a really nice wee bar area for socialising - they do great coffees too. As an add-on note, I attended a client event here last year (they had the Love is Love stiletto in the foyer which was superb!) and it was excellent too - the staff were so great - canapés and drinks very good.

445,"I upgraded to a balcony room on level 8 after seeing the website photos. On entry to my particular room it was apparent their interpretation of a balcony and mine (and the dictionary's) are quite different. This was more of a tiny patio looking out to a plain non-descript terrace with a sad grass field and a few bushes. There was no view to speak of. To even get to the 'balcony' from the room one had to step over a fair ledge. If when booking this hotel and requesting a balcony room check if its on level 8 and if yes, then politely decline.The room size was however generous but the bathroom was tiny and if one has any balance or mobility issues or is on the larger side, give these rooms a miss as it requires some contortions to get into the shower stepping across the toilet and over the bathtub and twisting to get to the shower. A couple of handrails should be mandatory to assist guests.The lobby and the staff is where the hotel makes up lost ground. The happy hour specials in both food and drinks were fabulous. Jess behind the bar was brilliant.One point does require a special mention. At front of house the hotel has employed a young lady with an intellectual disability to welcome people through the doors into the hotel. She was immaculately presented and did a great job. To give someone with a disability an opportunity to be the face of caring humanity in a modern workplace deserves high praise. Well done Novotel.","April 12, 2019","8    Novotel Sydney Central

459,"Visiting Sydney there's an abundance of hotels to select from. The Novotel Sydney Central had a few strengths that made us select it. First of all the location was good, central but not too busy. Compared to some other hotels it also offered pretty decent value for money while offering the necessities.The common areas appear to have been fairly recently renovated or at least ""refreshed"". The rooms and the corridors do have show that it is perhaps not the most modern. We were still satisfied with the room as it was clean, everything worked well and the beds were comfortable. The rooms also had enough space for it to not feel cramped. The views from the upper floors were also pretty nice.The pool was pretty small so not for swimming laps in but it served its purpose for us and we liked that it was also warm enough. The fitness center also had everything that was needed.Breakfast at the hotel was pretty good, they had a good mix of both hot and cold food. There were fresh juices and some of the hot dishes were rotated every other day. Still it would have gotten a bit boring if it would not have been for the option to order some omelette or other egg dishes. Overall still a good breakfast.One of the main strengths of the hotel was also the service. We constantly felt that everyone we interacted with were helpful, friendly and genuinely seemed to like working there. When it also feels genuine it really makes the stay so much better.","January 28, 2019","8    Novotel Sydney Central

461,"Being a Novotel, the standard is assured, but this Site delighted me for I well remember the meat company that occupied the site. Indeed the historic facade has been utilised for the hotel’s restaurant “FieldHouse” entrance. I was impressed by the view from the restaurant through the expansive lobby to the front entrance steps.I was greeted by a uniformed doorman who never failed to notice my approaching entrances and exits throughout my stay.Checking in was most friendly, as indeed were all the staff I met. A real positive for this hotel is the staff who displayed an enthusiasm that is not always seen.During my stay I ate in the hotel restaurant and found there was always a table available. For my first meal, I chose the rump and medium rare was exactly medium rare. The menu was adequate in choice.My room had a Nespresso pod machine - just like home!The room was a good size but I felt the bathroom was on the small side. Not much room for a larger person! Also the shower was over a bath with a glass screen. With a cramped bathroom, it could have been a safety issue I felt.The room however was in the Novotel vogue, very clean and well-presented even though there were a couple of chips in the doors and fittings. Some guests must be quite careless in their stay.Would I stay again? You bet! It was a real treat.","January 17, 2019","8    Novotel Sydney Central

463,"This hotel is always very pleasant and the staff member on the front Brado (I think that's what his name is) is a true asset to your hotel. Everything is always lovely, however this time I was left disappointed at breakfast. Firstly the lady who was seating everyone actually forgot about us and then once we were seated we had to walk around the coffee and drink counter to get to the food because the pancake machine is in the most inconvenient spot and no one could get through if there were people waiting there or at the cereal station. This was especially difficult as there were many people seated in the breakfast area and we couldn't walk between the tables. I had to ask for plates to be brought out and then had to ask for bowls to be brought out also even after I waited in case they were on their way. The hotel though is great and like I said the staff are always amazing. Will certainly return :-)","January 13, 2019","8    Novotel Sydney Central

The location is near to Central station, and not too far from Darling Harbour, which is good.There are a few unique facilities which I loved about this hotel are:> The fresh fruit juicer is an awesome thing, where guests who don't want to have added sugar with canned juices can prepare fresh juices, with wide variety of fruits.> The microwave facility in the room for long staying guests really helps the vegetarians who want to prepare some food on their own in the room.> The washing machine at 9th floor is great for those who don't want to spend huge amounts in laundry.> Special Mention: Breakfast staff Hannah, who helped to arrange vegetarian options for me, even when they were not part of the menu, which was a breather for me, as I had limited options in the menu.Overall, it was a great place to stay, and would recommend this hotel to everyone.","December 4, 2018","8    Novotel Sydney Central

Plenty of room we had 2 queen size beds with a balcony. The staff smartly placed us on the same floor as the pool. Terrific for the kids but also terrific for us parents. Food options in the area are endless. Take your pick everything in short walking distance. Went to a great market in Chinatown on Friday night kids loved trying all the different foods. Myself and my husband enjoyed a wine in the bar area on two occasions. Lovely friendly staff. Supermarket and bottle shop for essentials 2 mins walk away. Breaky was nice, barista made coffee and eggs anyway order takin as you are seated. Buffet was all the normal breaky options. Loved the addition of juicer.

Check in is never a problem. The Staff are wonderful. Such pleasant folk. Nothing is a problem and they always assure my keys and room are ready.

If I request extra tea and milk it's there waiting. I always feel looked after and valued. I'm never really ready to check out and go home so when that time comes Reception are always happy to extend my parking until I've popped into Chinatown to do some last minute shopping at Paddy's Markets or pick up some local delicacies.

The reception was modest — not opulent- London shangrila standard; first impressions matter and this one was pretty insipid lacking oomph !We were checked in early at 8.30 - it was courteous, professional but without a smile and a bit clinical We had booked the harbour and opera house view ( paid a bomb!) and the views were peerless and spectacular - unrivalled! Phil at the concierge was quick, receptive and personalised the 4 day trip for us - shangrila standards! The breakfast however was chaotic — with stressful waiters running around like headless chickens, sweat on their brow , fidgety and skittish with little attention to customer needs — this was the most underwhelming segment of the stay —- worse than a ‘ best western ‘ experience You pay for those panoramic - behemoth views; rest of the shangrila is passable as a 4 star","July 10, 2019","9    Shangri-La Hotel Sydney

When we arrived we were give the suite on level 10 and dismissed by the staff when we explained we had booked the higher floor. After making us wait 1.5hours and numerous calls from our suite on level 10 we were moved to level 20. The service was disgusting and not to the level expected. We had to buzz room service 3 times to get a bucket of ice which took about 40mins. I had organised to have the room decorated and a birthday cake for my partner which they had committed to have ready for us on arrival. The room was decorated but no cake to be seen. It would be one of my worst experience staying at a hotel. They did (after some pressure from my partner) provide us with a bottle of nice champagne and several small desserts. I would NEVER recommend this hotel to anyone.,"July 6, 2019","9    Shangri-La Hotel Sydney

495,"I had been so excited to stay here, but in the end found my stay underwhelming, given my high expectations. Many little things just didn’t come together: the conditioner bottles in the room I was staying in were empty, the elevators were under repair and so those still in service were very slow, there was some mildew in the shower, and my “harbor view” room in fact overlooked a noisy highway over which you could partially see Darling Harbor.Overall, the facilities were clean and the staff were professional. However, given the price, I wouldn’t stay here again.","June 28, 2019","9    Shangri-La Hotel Sydney

496,"Booked through Expedia for 2 nights mid May 2019. Checked in at 2 pm, was given a room on the 13th floor with beds exactly as requested and water view (not the opera house / harbour view). This view is beautiful as well though, no worries if you're on that side of the hotel. The room was spotless with a big flat screen tv, mini bar, kettle, fridge, coffee/tea maker, everything was fully stocked. The bathroom was trimmed in marble and stone with a large solid wood vanity, big sink, huge vanity mirror, big bathtub where you could easily bath and drink champagne (I did of course) & separate shower. I really enjoyed primping in there for my nights out on the town. The location is walking distance to opera house and Circular Quay and many restaurants. We enjoyed the pool and hot tub but the chemicals in the hot tub were so strong even the steam burned my eyes and I didn't stay in for long. Still, did enjoy the facilities, the gym is well equipped and not many people using it. Now, to my favourite feature of this hotel, the bar on the 34th floor. We went up there both nights and enjoyed the view and the ambiance immensely. It isn't as expensive as you'd expect for a bar with this kind of drop dead gorgeous view. The cost of the room for 2 nights was around the $500 US and it was worth it just for the view from the bar. You can, of course, enjoy the bar without staying in the hotel. But for the fact that I could get ready in my beautiful room, put on my stilettos and go up in the elevator to that bar with that killer view for my cocktails was worth every penny. Because you can't walk around Sydney in stilettos unless you want to end up with a broken leg (cobble stone sidewalks, etc, ha ha). We didn't have much contact with the staff, only a couple of buckets of ice brought up, 1st time took 5 minutes, 2nd time took 30 minutes. The check-in and check-out agents were perfunctory, courteous and everything went smoothly. I would likely stay at this hotel again when travelling to Sydney.","June 26, 2019","9    Shangri-La Hotel Sydney

497,"Staying here currently and though the property is nice there do seem to be quite a few issues with services..Went for breakfast.. and had a first with my sister being told that she could not come into the restaurant wearing room slippers.. we've stayed at top notch hotels and never had this complaint to us. After which she changed into her own slippers..We ordered eggs at our table, after sitting for like 25 mins.we got up to leave and then they arrived.. we were quite infuriated by this time as we were waiting with my 3 and 5 year old sons.. and waiting to feed them too..I have complimentary breakfast with my room stay but I'm definitely not eating here again. The service is very poor though the staff do try hard.. they just seem to be understaffed or just too many orders. The best option would be to have table nos. And a live egg station so that people order their eggs at one place.. and everyone gets their order in the serial no. Which they have ordered.We had to wait for like 10 mins for our turn at check in.. when we arrived after 4 PM. I had made the reservation through the fine hotels program of amex platinum so did get the upgrade offer. Which was fine.The 36th floor bar keeps the lifts so busy most of the times that I was frustrated half the time waiting for the lift or waiting for one with some room in it.Over all I'm not going to be coming back here on a business or family trip ever again. Rather I'd try a new hotel.","June 23, 2019","9    Shangri-La Hotel Sydney

Would definitely recommend staying here for business or for family trips away. Or for any reason really- it’s a great place to stay :-) Thank you to the wonderful staff.

500,"We were left disappointed after paying just shy of 1k for a two night stay. On arrival the queues at reception were terrible and check in was an extremely lengthy process. Elevators were terrible! (Yes, I know you’re upgrading them but a bit late!). The room was clean but dated and view was very good. Later that night we arrived at the blu bar where there were lots of empty tables and a sign saying reservations only. When I asked I was shocked to be informed of a minimum spend policy: “Those tables along there are $150 and over there $200”. Whoever decided that this would be a good idea needs to be fired. Weeks earlier I had emailed the hotel asking if there was a requirement to reserve these tables and I did not receive a response. Anyway, knowing that I was going to spend in excess of the minimum spend I took a table and ordered a bottle of champagne and afterwards some additional drinks. The service was too slow. The following night we went to Blu for a drink in advance of going out for dinner and sat across from the bar and the service was horrifically slow. Adding to that there were two powered speakers on stands blaring music. The audio quality wasn’t good, it was intrusive and somewhat reminded me of what it’s like to attend a party with a mobile DJ. We used the leisure facilities which were clean but basic. No sauna or steam. The neighboring Four Seasons offers a much more luxurious and exclusive experience. My advice to the hotel? Examine the detail and consider the overall experience. Figure out how to make your check in process more efficient... it can be done!! Don’t think it’s alright to charge five star prices and then insult guests with minimum spend rules for tables in your bar. Two stars given for location and view.

501,"Terrible is an understatement. They rely purely on their view and location. The service is non existent and their facilities are just awful. On arrival, nobody to welcome you in the driveway, inside, the concierges are having a chat amongst themselves, nobody welcomed us or assist with bags. Check in was horrific. Long queues and undertrained staff. Then, came our first experience with the lifts. The wait for them each time is a joke. This happened every single time we needed to go up or down.The view from the room was nice but that was about it. Ageing furniture, carpets and cleanliness was below par. Wanted to play some music but no Bluetooth speaker. Some sad alarm clock on the bed side table where you can put your phone on (see photo attached) but wait... unless you have an iPhone 4 or earlier it won’t work as it is the old charger. Guys, Apple changed those in 2012! When you charge $900 a night, surely you can replace it with newer technology. It has been 7 years! Went out to dinner and decided to go to blu bar for a night cap. We used to live in Sydney 10 years ago and it was the place to be. Cocktails, service and atmosphere were on point. It seems it has aged as gracefully as the alarm clock. Service was terrible.... cocktails took forever and it wasn’t busy. We sat in the lounge and were told the window tables are reserved for a minimum spend. I guess the $900 for the room didn’t cut it. During the entire time we were there, that table remained unoccupied. Service in that bar was disgraceful.We bought a room with the horizon club access. Only used it for brekkie and I wish we didn’t spend the extra $. Again, the staff were clueless and the wait was way too long. We grabbed a pastry and walk away. Overall, this place is a dump. If they didn’t have the location and view, they would put the keys under the door as any other offering, product or service is nonexistent.

After that the service experience and in house breakfast left much to be desired. Service staff surly and unhelpful when asked for assistance. What a shame really. If I could have done the self service option I would have but couldn’t. The restaurant mandates you order eggs, coffee from the staff which they weren’t very willing to help. Have stayed at shangrilas in other countries and this is the first time that I experienced such poor standards. After ordering in room meals, was charged additional costs that have not been refunded despite several interactions with different staff that said it would be done. Very terrible and outright unprofessional!Please stay away from this Shangri-la and not let it ruin your experience ","June 13, 2019","9    Shangri-La Hotel Sydney

503,"My wife and I decided to spend a night at the Shangri-La Hotel Sydney to celebrate my Birthday and enjoy Vivid. We booked a harbour view room for $680. For the room rate we were expecting something special but unfortunately our experience was the opposite. We arrived at the hotel at 3pm, and the reception was in chaos. We waited 30 minutes just to check in and there was no-one there to assist with bags. There is some lift maintenance happening that made matters worse but that can't be helped. I guess. After settling in our room we called reception to order some ice so that we could have a drink. We waited nearly an hour just to get some ice and a bucket. The rooms were very tired and certainly not what Id expect from a room costing $680..We decided to go to Blu bar in l36. The bar was also in a state of chaos. The bar was understaffed and eventually we were given a table. We waited 30 minutes to be served and gave up and left, deciding to get a drink outside the hotel. We went down for breakfast the next day and the same issues continued. They were clearly understaffed and we waited 20 minutes just to get a table. Breakfast was OK but very forgettable. I expect more from this group as they are supposed to be under new management. my birthday celebration and vivid experience was underwhelming to say the least. I would not recommend this hotel.

Room was huge with all the bits expected from a Shangri-La. Silvano at the breakfast buffet was gracious every morning and kept his calm during the busy mornings and demanding guests. Excellent fully equipped gym, calming swimming pool (except when children were around), relaxing jacuzzi. I was greeted by name at each encounter with staff and for such a large busy hotel I was impressed. The bar on the 36th floor needs to work out flow of service.

508,"The Shangri-La Sydney is in a great location away from the busy streets but close enough to walk to the harbour and the Opera House. The rooms are spacious and then service is everything you would expect from a Shangri-La hotel.It takes about 35 minutes in an Uber to get from the airport to the hotel with a bit of traffic. Check-in was quick and our bags were brought up to the room straight away.We stayed in a Premier Sydney Harbour Room for an anniversary stay. I can say with almost certainty that the views from this room over the harbour and the Opera house are some of the best views from any city hotel in the world. The room was nice and spacious with a large bathroom and a very powerful shower. We were given a complimentary bottle of Champaign for our anniversary stay.The location of the hotel is perfect, it takes about 25 minutes to walk to the botanical gardens, and about 10 minutes shorter to walk to the harbour. The street on which the hotel is located has a couple of local pubs with an amazing Japanese teppanyaki place on the corner.The hotel bar on the top floor of course had awesome views but the bar itself was a little disappointing. It is small for a start, and it takes ages to get a drink as there are literally two guys making cocktails. Good to pop up, but annoying to stay. There are enough late-night bars in the main financial district to not have to stay in the hotel anyway.There is no other bar in the hotel, which is surprising as there is usually a lobby bar in Shangri-la hotels. There is a a café in the lobby for lunchtime snacks but I felt the menu was a little basic and bland.Check out was easy and we were able to get a taxi to the airport.","June 9, 2019","9    Shangri-La Hotel Sydney

509,"This was the last of three hotels we booked on our Australian vacation. This was actually the hotel we were looking forward to the most. We were very disappointed. Check-in was slow, they couldn’t find our booking off of two of our names, and the credit card which I had pre-paid with...the. When they finally found it, provided no apologies, and still did not know that we had booked for 3 adults. They did not offer any options for extras at check in like breakfast or club level, which I usually purchase. I was too frustrated and tired from the flight to even bother to ask. Room was JUsT ready for us at 2:30pm, and was told that check in wasn’t supposed to be until 4pm? Not sure the purpose of irritating a guest more, when the room was actually ready.The room was dirty with stained carpets, TV in bedroom did not work, sofa was also dirty in beat up condition. Since we had 3 adults, we called for the sofa bed to be made up. We then left to explore the city and get some food.When we returned, the sofa bed had not been made still. Had to call again at 9pm.

The horizon club was well run and really easy to use for breakfast and evening canapés rather than needing to head downstairs to use the other hotel restaurant. While I gave this hotel a 5 rating there were a couple of things that could be improved. The lifts were quite slow at times but I understand these are being renovated so this issue should be fixed. I also found our bed mattress to be a bit hard, although it was more than offset by the view and otherwise well maintained room.

513,"Firstly, I should say the room was comfortable and quiet and the views of the harbour fantastic. Staff were helpful and pleasant. I was aware that Vivid was on and that this hotel often hosts large one-off events like balls etc. But the busy-ness is notable. For example, the driveway seemed to be a log-jam and the car-park was full by 4 pm when we arrived. (Thanks for the printed sheet with directions to nearby carpark. Would be good to add what it usually costs to park there. Ours was $30 for overnight on a Saturday which is pretty good and it’s only a block away). Also, the wait for lifts was a bit disappointing and they were all crowded full. Which is surprising considering there are six of them and they move quickly when you manage to actually get inside one. People were not happy with the lift operation. Heard lots of grumbles about it.

516,"I booked a Darling harbour view room via a third party website for Vivid, as I wanted to take my 5 year old and my baby. When we went to check in, I was told the front desk lady had to juggle some rooms around to get me an available room. She told me to go and sit with the baby and she would bring the key over. I did that and she proceeded to serve a long line of people, despite two or three other agents being available. I approached her and said, ‘how are you going?’ She said, ‘I’ll do it soon’. Weird.I lined up to see a different agent who gave me the room key. Went and looked at the room which had a view of Fort Street public school. Not exactly what I expected from a darling harbour view room. I went downstairs and asked to upgrade, which I could for an extra $250 for two nights, making the total for my stay $850- with no breakfast or parking. I found some of the staff quite rude. As one other person notes here on Trip Advisor, if you’re dressed down in jeans and sneakers, don’t expect any service from staff. The guys on the front door didn’t even acknowledge me when we came back to the hotel on our second day.The positives are the view, and the spa area, which was nice and hot.I am a Hilton honors member, so would go back there in a heartbeat over the Shangri-La.

It's so amazing and thank you so much.I got bad smell in my room, then I have been changed the room in time. This is professional management. Thank you for your team.The only thing that I feel strange for me compared with many hotels I stayed especially shangri-la chain in Thailand which is the skill of well-trained staff for costumer value in the same standard.I came alone by walking without sitting in a taxi with the t-shirt, wearing jeans and sneakers without the dress and high heel shoes or expensive bag, no one asked to help me for my luggage. Well, it might be busy time but you can manage it better. The lady the red uniform asked me help for check in, this I am appreciate that. Mr.Eranja who checked me in was so nice and very professional, thank you for give me the room early checking in time. I cheer you up. Mr.Johny at the bell counter was so kind,  polite and humble as what I always feel follow your chain standard.When I check out there are many staff which are more take care of the people in the suit more rather than me which is again with the sneaker jeans and a t-shirt. What I saw, your team was immediately approached to the guests with the suit more which I feel weird because I never met this situation in 4- 5 stars hotels.I don't mind about this situation but it would be better if you can give more care the customer or anyone inside your hotel, and consider them as a guest at the same standard. It can be better. The water in the room for sale can be more clean. Its unacceptable for the dust which shows your team didt care it. *pictures*Well done, and will be back. I hope that I can see your improvement about my feedback.Thank you.","May 27, 2019","9    Shangri-La Hotel Sydney

Short walk to the rocks which had great cafe's, restaurants and very close to the ferry terminal to catch a ferry to Manly. Everyone at the hotel was very friendly and helpful.","May 26, 2019","9    Shangri-La Hotel Sydney

520,"I have always loved staying at the Shangri-La and this time was no different. My flight was cancelled and so I booked a last minute harbour view room. This was spacious, well appointed with delight Loccitane ammenities. The bed was comfortable with comfortable pillows also.Check in was quite delayed due to a sudden arrival of a large number of guests but was handled professionally. The ambience was beautiful with a Christmas theme at the time.I has breakfast in the lobby cafe which was ok - normally when I'm in Sydney I visit local cafes and wished I had of done this on this occasion. Overall i only spent around 12 hours in the hotel but was a delightful experience and would stay there again when in Sydney.","May 24, 2019","9    Shangri-La Hotel Sydney

521,"There were some issues with this hotel, I requested rooms adjoining they said they didn't have and then I went up to the room and noticed we had a door I called down to have it opened. I had paid for a view of the Opera House but was looking at another building. I went to the roof top bar and was told I need to go to the bartender to order my drinks even though there were only a few people in the bar. No one welcomed us. I went to the restaurant for dessert one night and was told my family could not sit in the little picnic area they had set up for Easter without paying a huge surcharge. The elevators took forever and stopped on ever floor people kept piling in because they didn't want to wait for another elevator. At night I could not get the music pipped in the room to shut off I had to call maintenance, who took over an hour at 3am the music kept blasting in the bedroom! The hotel did provide complimentary breakfast as an apology which was very nice. Unfortunately this hotel is mass of and doesn't give you that welcome feeling or the want to return.","May 21, 2019","9    Shangri-La Hotel Sydney

522,Maybe I expected too much. Hotel is okay - clean rooms - positive is lots of good size towels. Hotel looks tired - unimpressive. Reception staff were lovely. One thing which surprised me - was nice big bathroom but no soaps to go with the bath - one tiny bottle for the shower but if you took a bath in the evening you had nothing for the shower in the morning. It’s the only hotel I’ve been in that only puts a ( one shot) bottle of shower gel in the shower and doesn’t provide any for the bath. Breakfast was good - but lukewarm - staff lovely. I used the pool - some areas of the pool - changing rooms environs really could do with a good clean / paint / re-plastering - I found the condition surprising. Again the staff were absolutely lovely. I had coffee in the lobby - staff were again very nice. Overall - there must be better hotels in the city because if this is the best then pity the others. We didn’t have a good experience in the Altitude Restaurant for Brunch - see my other review. I’ve tried to not let that temper my feedback for the hotel and on re-reading it I think I have the balance right. ,"May 20, 2019","9    Shangri-La Hotel Sydney

523,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Our room had a great view of both the Harbor Bridge and the Opera House. The bed was very comfortable and the room was spacious. We stayed in a regular room for our first stay and a Horizon room for our second stay. The Horizon room had the feel of being more recently renovated. The Horizon lounge on the 30th floor is a great experience for breakfast, afternoon tea and drinks in the evening. The lounge staff were fantastic and a credit to the hotel. Overall, we found the staff to be very attentive to the needs of the hotel guests and they was a difference maker for us. Having read the mixed reviews on Trip Advisor and particularly the comments about the long waits for elevators, i was concerned about staying at this hotel. In our experience the longest we had to wait for an elevator was 2 minutes during the peak breakfast period. It wasn't an issue for us at all. One concern I do want to mention is the breakfast buffet in Cafe Mix. The 'hot' food in the buffet was cold to lukewarm every day we were there. i did mention this to the managers. what we ended up doing was ordering food directly from the kitchen and it was always hot. Despite this concern, we still rate our overall experience as five stars. The hotel has a great staff; very nice rooms; nice restaurant and bar on the 36th floor with great harbor views; great location for the Rocks, Harbor area and CBD. Definitely recommend and we will be back. ","May 19, 2019","9    Shangri-La Hotel Sydney

527,Booked the Shangri-La for a business trip of a couple of days. On arrival I checked out the hotel to find a breakfast room and buffet that felt more like a motel than a 5 star hotel in a major city. I was very early (6 am) and begged for an early check-in. They were not at all helpful and the hours passed by. In the end I found myself at 12:30 pm showering and dressing for my meetings in a public area of the Hotel. Just to be clear and avoid a misunderstanding: I know check in is usually in the afternoon. But no hotel in my many years of traveling for work has ever been so inflexible. Add this to the run-down property and I say steer clear of the Sydney Shangri-La if you can!,"May 15, 2019","9    Shangri-La Hotel Sydney

There was a different cruise ship docked nearly every day I was there. The staff were very helpful, the bed was comfortable and the room was clean. I have booked it through booking .com and normally I get the points towards my golden circle loyalty but upon check out I was informed that it’s no longer the case imagine 5 nights of accommodation without the points it doesn’t seem fair. I didn’t even get an email from Shangrila golden circle of the change of policy. I pointed out my expense in the restaurant and horizon club I should get it credited as points but I’m not so sure.

The breakfast buffet is plentiful, tasty, and nicely served. I only ate dinner at the hotel one night, but the food was delicious. The staff is attentive and efficient. It's situated in The Rocks, which is an old, interesting and fun neighborhood. And it's walking distance from the harbor, the Opera House, the Botanical Gardens, and more. I should note that it's on a fairly steep hill, so if you have any trouble walking I suppose that could be a problem. My room was on the 9th floor and had a nice view of the harbor--but there is a highway between the hotel and the water. Next time I might try to get a room on a higher floor.

We checked in 4 hours early and our room was ready but maybe just because of time of year?Hotel seems nice enough, our room was on the rear of the building over looking a school field, noisy during the day but quiet at night. The gardeners decided however to cut the grass at 7.30 am and school activities start quite early so don't expect much of a lay in.Room is very compact and could use some additional shelving or storage especially in the toilet room.The king bed was massive and very comfortable though.Shower is nice and big, almost half the size of the toilet room easily big enough for two.

The standard room was just simply not compatible with two people and two sets of luggage. Even just opening the shower door without smacking into something required a bit of caution. We didn’t really have much room for toiletries either. The shower was a bit grubby too which didn’t help.Our window overlooked next doors property (this may have even been another hotel owned by the same group - I can’t remember). We were regularly woken by guests playing music or shouting from the other property, the window did so little to break the noise we even checked to make sure it was closed.All in all, the location was what was needed so it served its purpose but I probably wouldn’t rush back given the price of their bigger rooms vs other options in the area.

There was also a desk, two chairs and a small closet. Our room was made up daily and towels and bathroom amenities were replaced. Wifi was free (up to a specified amount) and quite good.The man at the front desk in the evening was very, very helpful and went out of his way to give us directions and other information.

579,"I stayed at this hotel with my partner in October 2018. We stayed for three nights as part of a small stopover on a trip to Australia. On arriving quite late at night at 9 PM after travelling for nearly 30 hours reception staff were available to assist with checking in and the process was smooth and easy. An elevator was available to upper floors which was very convenient considering we had a little luggage with us. The room was clean and tidy and very well presented. The room had a fridge also a kettle and tea and coffee making facilities. The bathroom was well stocked with conditioner, shampoo and soap. The bedroom was rather on the small side and this was the only downside. It was adequate enough for us for the three nights that we stayed if we were staying any longer I would’ve preferred something a bit larger with a bit more space. However saying that the hotel had made the room nice and presentable and made use of all of the available space. We stayed on a room only basis and there is no breakfast available however there are plenty of places nearby, like King’s Cross where you can get food for breakfast lunch and dinner as well a local supermarket. There is a great cafe which does a english breakfast for only six dollars. To summarise we both enjoyed our time here and mainly used the room as a base to see Sydney and didn’t spend a great deal of time in the room, but we would return for a short stay in the future if we needed to.

Apparently so, the rooms with bathtubs have no view, perplexed why there are no rooms with both, but thats fine. We were on level 6, and could hear every kid running and screaming along the corridor, every adult talking in the aisle, every trolley being pushed, every door opening and closing. The breakfast choice was appalingly minimal, it was not topped up regularly and seems lacklustre and cold.

605,"Spent 3 nights at this hotel on a business trip. Centrally located and modern. Pleasant common areas and good, clean and comfortable rooms with a good bed. Weaker points included a less-than-inspiring breakfast (not a single vegetable to be seen; tasteless bread; uneven preparation of eggs) and a very small gym lacking even towels (one is referred to the adjacent swimming pool, but towels there are inadequate for gym). There was also repeated misunderstanding regarding the fact that my reservation included breakfast, which was sorted only at check-out. Altogether a pleasant hotel, but I would rank it as good, not very good, if this level existed at TripAdvisor.","May 13, 2019","11    Novotel Sydney Darling Square

Breakfast is decent and so is room service.We were given an upgrade (not bad considering we'd used points instead of cash in the first place) so we ended up with a room on the top floor facing the Chinese Garden of Friendship.

610,"This was my first time staying in a Novotel hotel. I chose this hotel as it's near to ICC where I was attending a conference. The location is right next to Chinatown and it's about a 10 min walk to World Square Shopping Centre. It's also about 10-15 min walk to the Harbour where you can see fireworks on Saturday nights. I stayed here for 5 nights at the Superior Room with buffet breakfast. Room was nice and clean. Heard that the hotel was recently renovated, which would explain why everything looks new. The buffet breakfast is the same every morning. The scrambled eggs were rather bland so you need to add salt & pepper. The food was just average but to be honest, there were days where I skipped and ate breakfast outside instead. Staff were polite and friendly. I ordered a cappuccino from the hotel bar/cafe, it was slightly pricey and nothing special. Order if you are in dire need of coffee, else you will probably be better off getting your coffee from elsewhere. After all, this is Australia. Lots of good coffee places around.Overall, this hotel is not the most exciting but it's a convenient location to ICC so I would recommend it to business travelers.","April 19, 2019","11    Novotel Sydney Darling Square

611,"Novotel Darling Square has one of the best teams of staff I have come across anywhere in the world, and I am no novice traveller. Be aware that there are three Novotels in close proximity in the Darling Harbour area, so it’s wise to double check you are booking the one you want. This is not the one with the Darling Harbour views.Location; Unless you specifically want a harbour view, this is the best located hotel in the area. It’s a five min walk from Central Station ( every rail line passes through Central), five mins walk to everything from casual to hatted dining in Darling Harbour, Sealife Aquarium, the Day Harbour Cruise terminal, Madam Tussauds and Darling Harbour shopping district.It’s just two mins walk to The Capitol Theatre, The Sydney International Convention Centre and the massive kids waterpark / playground. Darling Harbour is well lit and well patrolled every night and is considered safe, so take the kids to see the weekly Saturday night fireworks display or walk around the waterfront for amazing night harbour views. If you want a harbour cruise for pennies, it’s also a 10 min walk to the public ferry terminal at Pyrmont Bay ( next to the Maritime museum) or Barangaroo; just catch the public ferry under the Harbour Bridge to Circular Quay, and catch the train back from there to Central Station, all using your Opal Card ( like London’s Oyster card and available from newsagents, train stations and other stores with Opal signage).Darling Square Novotel is immaculately clean, but as newish hotel, you would expect everything to be all shiny and in great condition. The indoor swimming pool was also immaculate, the gym was immaculate. You couldn’t fault it.Bathrooms are modern with a choice of traditional shower head or a rain shower. The frosted glass bathroom doors give you pause for privacy concerns when sharing a twin room with a friend, but nothing can be seen - not even an outline of what you might be doing in there, lol !!Rooms are not huge by Australian standards, but are larger than you would be finding in most international cities. There was still room for twin beds, large desk, two chairs, a side table, two bedsides, minibar / coffee station, all without having to stub your toes on anything.Where this hotel lifted from average to “wow!” was the staff. This is a modestly priced Sydney hotel and I was treated exactly the way I would like to be treated. From reception to breakfast to check out, every staff member had a beautiful balance of being friendly and interested and helpful but not to the point of being fawning or in-your-face, which I prefer. They read me perfectly. The older couple behind me at breakfast obviously did prefer OTT attentiveness, and that’s what they got, with staff scuttling everywhere to bring them coffee and special orders and longer conversations.The other thing I need to point out was this Novotel was properly staffed. There’s nothing that stops me relaxing faster than watching overworked, stressed staff. It’s not usually a problem with Accor hotels, and certainly wasn’t this visit.I would absolutely recommend this place, especially for international visitors that want a friendly location that better defines the Australian way of life, rather just another cityscape that could be anywhere in the world.I will coming back.","April 17, 2019","11    Novotel Sydney Darling Square

618,"It is a time of personalisation and customer service. Of individuality and creating experiences. The Novotel excels on delivering exactly the opposite of that. It is cookie cutter, dull, boring, plain beige and as unexciting as it comes. You are a number amongst others. They have no ideas who is staying with them and they couldn’t care. They just sell you a bed from 2pm to 11am the following day. They don’t care about customer service and they don’t even try to. Then comes the bars and restaurants. The buffet breakfast is the same food you get everywhere else but badly cooked and badly presented. The lobby bar. As boring as it can get. The place is a ghost town serving badly made, cheap drinks. The pumphouse next door. So much potential but it just fails on all levels. It’s dirty, serves terrible food and it is manned by employees who clearly do not care. I kept the best (worst part) for the end. The hotel staff. Wowsers! They could not be more unhelpful if they tried. They are the perfect culture fit with that property. No life, dull and as useless as they come. We didn’t encounter a single half decent staff member. I am very picky but this had to be by far my worst experience in a hotel. How do places like this that care so little about customer service survive in these days and age? Reading the other reviews and mostly the replies of their manager, they are as dull and boring as his hotel.

Outside access to the hotel was difficult during our stay due to construction of a new entrance way canopy. Once this structure is completed there will be no problem. Check in was efficient plus friendly. Double bedded rooms aren't big but they are quiet, bright and very well designed plus set up with everything required for a comfortable stay. No bath, but a great shower with bathroom fittings and amenities being to a high standard. Aside from figuring out how to operate the capsule coffee machine, breakfast was very good, reasonable choice and excellent quality. One highlight of breakfast was the staff who were not only polite, friendly but also went out of their way to assist (poached egg provision and coffee machine operation instruction). Something I wouldn't notice or comment on unless it was to the contrary, was the exceptional level of cleanliness in all areas of the property. The room itself was spotless as were the public areas, not easy, especially with a construction site literally at the front door. One draw back, but not applicable in our instance, is the chronic shortage of onsite parking. Parking aside, a very good property that I would have no hesitation in recommending.

But they gave me a voucher for a coffee at the bar this time. The staff at reception did not inform me, that finally the room was ready, but I had to ask for it! But I have to say, that I got a very nice corner room on the seventh floor. It seems, that they made some upgrades in their hotel, which was not even finished during my stay, as there were construction works at the canopy over the entrance.

638,"Stayed here in January with my 8 year old daughter. Hotel is stylish and smart and I like how it is not too big. Room was clean and comfortable. We were in a twin room (basically a double room with the beds separated), so there isn’t as much room between beds. The bathrooms are well equipped with a large shower. The pool is indoor and has a good view of the city. Maybe request a room in a higher level to get a better view. There looked to be an unfinished building opposite the hotel but no construction happening while we were there. Breakfast was additional for us but worth it as you pay for the adult and the child eats free. It’s a large buffet style with a good coffee machine. Kristina on breakfast service was just lovely and made my daughter a hot chocolate each morning.Novotels are a good chain and as a result, do get large groups of package travellers who are in and out in a rush (especially around the food). But overall this hotel is a nice size and in a great location, with an easy walk to the trains and Darling Harbour.","January 25, 2019","11    Novotel Sydney Darling Square

641,"This hotel is very excellently located, next to Darling Harbour, the Convention Centre and China Town, and in a close walking distance to the Town Hall city centre. The hotel itself is very comfortable, modern, very clean and the rooms spacious and air-conditioned, with all facilities. The staff is very polite and efficient without being too friendly or patronizing. Would take the opportunity to mention Jeremy and Wilson for helping us have a great time. They are at the front desk and very helpful. The staff is very attentive to everyone's needs, including babies and young children, and elderly people. The hall, bar and breakfast room are very airy and well designed. Couple of areas where they can improve are....Firstly the breakfast menu remains stagnant and is very average. Secondly, the front desk staff normally are helping with the luggage themselves and do not have any porters to help. Since we were transiting between NZ and India, we had a lot of luggage which meant a lot of effort for us as well as the front desk people. However, will not cut any points for these areas since were really happy with the location and services. The pump house, which is a bar located very close to the hotel is reasonable and caters to the dining requirement of the hotel. The Gym and pool is just for Namesake and does not add anything to the experience. However, due to the location and services of comfort and recommending this hotel as a value for money hotel.","January 12, 2019","11    Novotel Sydney Darling Square

645,"We had booked the hotel through agoda. Agoda booking confirms that the room is for 2 adults + 2 children. To be doubly sure, we called the hotel, well in advance, to confirm. The front desk has informed us that the room is for 2 adults + 2 children and they have made necessary notes in their system. When we visited the hotel, the front desk refused to accept 2 children stating that all rooms in their hotel can accommodate only 3 persons. When I referred to the agoda website and booking, the manager in the reception refused to take note of it. He simply denied stating that they are not responsible for what is mentioned on third party site. When asked why is it not informed when we called on phone, he simply refused to take any ownership and also refused to get in touch with colleague with whom we spoke before.

651,"As a family of 5, we stayed in a two bedroom apartment for five nights. Obviously recently renovated, the apartment was beautifully furnished, clean and modern. The furnishings were tasteful and the beds really comfortable. We were impressed by the friendliness and responsiveness of the staff. Whatever request we made was attended to in super quick time. Whether needing a change in bedding configuration on arrival, or requests for towels, clothes hangers, drying rack etc, someone would arrive at the door in minutes. Impressive service! The apartments are really conveniently located in Coogee’s main shopping area, with a Woolworths Metro just across the street, or the better Maloney’s Grocer about 50m down the street. The beach is about 150m down the street with plenty of restaurants and cafes on the way. Recommend Gusto for coffee about 50m down the hill. Buses and taxis are easily accessible, although we had our car. Parking is available at the apartments for $25/day. The kids enjoyed the indoor pool for a dip after long days out. Oh, and although they don’t advertise sea views, we could see the sea from our balcony as it was in the front of the building #65. Very happy with our stay!

There's no bar or restaurant in the hotel but there is a Thai restaurant right next door. Theres also a gym and swimming pool and a carpark. The hotel is situated on Coogee Bay Road up a steep hill opposite Woolworths and Dominos. The hill up to this hotel is very steep so not great for wheelchair users but everyone else it's perfect. The staff are helpful with booking taxis and helping give directions and stuff. Our room was the wheelchair accessible room and it was nice, spacious and the bathroom had a roll in shower and roll under sink. My only faults with the room was the bathroom used to flood everytime one of us had a shower and our balcony was too small. Theres a little kitchenette in the room and a big wardrobe.

703,"Stayed at the YHA four years ago with mixed results, but with more miles and hostel experiences under my belt, I decided to stay again.And my second experience here was overall really nice.Hostel is in a great location of The Rocks and the view from the roof of the harbour is lovely at day or night. It's about a 10 minute walk from Circular Quay, which is a stop off the airport line.I was in a 4-bed dorm which was great size and enough space for four people comfortably (and with luggage). Having the bathroom attached was also a nice treat.Kitchen at the hostel is big and enough space, but I was here in fall/winter when it was quieter so could be busier in summer or holiday time. Kitchen is well equipped too, although none of the pans were heat resistant on the handles so you had to use multiple towels to handle hot cooking equipment.Laundry is on-site and powder is available for sale too. Breakfast and coffee is available too for purchase although I did not end up buying.Closest full grocery store is about 25 minutes walk away, smaller metro market is about 10-15. Hostel hosts a lot of activities too and was very welcoming for people to join, other than that, it's not a very social place, people mostly kept to themselves.My only real complaint from my stay was Wifi. It kicks you off regularly and was very inconsistent in working in the main common areas. Would recommend this place and stay again.","May 17, 2019","13    Sydney Harbour YHA

707,"Having never stayed in a hostel before, I had no idea what I was in for! I was staying in Sydney overnight for a concert at the Opera House, and just wanted cheap overnight accommodation. At the time of booking, all the private rooms and female-only share rooms were booked out so I chose a mixed 4-share room. When I checked in, a man was already asleep on one of the beds, and I could see another of the beds was already taken by someone else. I crept in and got myself sorted, trying to be as quiet as possible. I got ready and went out, and returned after midnight. Only one person was in the room when I returned (not the person who was asleep earlier), and she was getting ready to go out. I went to bed, and was woken multiple times as the other guests came and went (they were polite and were as quiet as possible).I got up and checked out before 10am, after having a quick chat with the two guests who were also in my room when I got up. Everyone was lovely, but it was quite an interrupted night sleep.The staff were super lovely upon check in and check out. I didn't know I needed a lock for the lockers in the room, so I was happy to be able to purchase one at reception. It was a cheap Uber into the Harbour, and close to train station.Although I personally won't stay again in a share room, I would consider staying in a private room.

We shared a family room at the YHA and found everything to be in convenient walking distance. We stayed there prior to going on an overseas cruise, and as fantastic as the cruise was the children still talk fondly about their stay at the YHA and want to go back there again. The room had bunks and accommodated us without hassle, and having our own bathroom was a bonus too. The rooms up on the top level with the TV and Foosball was a much loved activity for the children. The kitchen was handy and it was clean. Staff were professional and always willing to assist when needed.

The hostel is big and also has a lot of families and older (60+) people, an atmosphere that I quite liked and thought was a plus, but may not be for everyone. The hostel regularly organises activities such as yoga and kayaking which I unfortunately wasn’t able to attend, but they looked great.Kitchen was spacious and the lounge was huge. The 4-bed dorm was a bit cramped but sufficient. Because it’s so small and the en-suite bathroom isn’t a separate room but part of the bedroom, it was sometimes hard to not wake up others. Facilities are clean.The cons: - I was a bit surprised I had to pay to be able to store my luggage prior to checking in (as I arrived before 2pm). The price also increases after a couple of hours, so I had to come back in time and not venture into the city too far.- Even though the hostel provides trip discounts, they seem to be catered to the more expensive trips. When I booked a Blue Mountains trip myself online, it was $40 cheaper than the one the reception suggested I booked with them. - There is nowhere to hang and dry your washing.","January 7, 2019","13    Sydney Harbour YHA

The hostel itself is lovely and clean. There's good music playing throughout the common areas and although it is played in the corridors, I could not hear this in the bedroom. The rooms also come with an en-suite which is really good - although less so when everyone wants to use the toilet or shower at the same time! It is a great location - but I made the mistake of getting off at Circular Quay and thought I'd be able to walk there... Big mistake and I ended up getting an Uber to the hostel. (Only now I realise the hostel recommend getting off at a different train station). You live and learn.I really enjoyed my time in Sydney and at this hostel.

722,"booked a double room for 2 pax with private bath last august 2018. arrived 8AM on the 1st day and they hotel offered to give us a room, despite 2pm checkin period. but since the rooms available did not have a view of opera house, they advised us to wait a bit in for others to check-out. we finally got a room at 1pm, and it has a good full view of sydney opera house! the room is clean, size is more than adequate for 2 pax. theres a 24H convenience store downstairs, a working lift, and nearby weekend market 10 mins walk from the property... note that the walk to the hotel from the train station is uphill, so any older ppl with big luggages beware. theres an activity every day in the hotel,you can also book your day trips with them. on our stay there's a sausage night (free) so we had a free light dinner. overall awesome stay and will definitely return to this hotel, and will . highly recommend this to my family and friendsthe only CON i can think of - they keep your luggage for a fee.","October 31, 2018","13    Sydney Harbour YHA

727,"We had two family rooms, and stayed a night before, and after a cruise. This was the perfect location, and within walking distance to the Circular Quay cruise terminal. From the roof of yha you could see the ship parked out the front, and great veiws of Sydney Harbour. The walk to the cruise terminal was steep downhill, with lots of stairs. I dont think i would do the walk the other way around with the steep uphill climb, not lugging suitcases anyway. Breakfast was well priced, and you cook it all yourself in the kitchens on reception level, as well as clean up after yourself. You are also able to purchase your own food and store it in the communal kitchen, as well as cook. The room was quite roomy, and i felt had a modern touch, especially the bathroom, which was quite large. Beds were comfy, and noise not an issue. I love the history behind this place, a historical site, where the ruins of old buildings were not allowed to be destroyed, so they have built yha around the old ruins, and there are cabinents with artifacts and bits and pieces that had been found on site all around the place. We were not able to control the temperature of our room, which was quite warm. I didnt realise till our last night at yha, that they ask you to strip your beds ect, as they are all volunteers that work there, so i do wonder about the clenliness of rooms, although ours did appear very clean. We arrived at yha early, so was wanting to leave our luggage and go out for the day. For this you need to hire lockers at a cost. ","October 4, 2018","13    Sydney Harbour YHA

They helped to store the bike, the breakfast was quite good and reasonable.

730,"Sydney Harbour YHA has an amazing location, set on an archaeological site on “The Rocks”. It’s in front of the Shangri-La, set above the harbour with amazing views of the Opera House. The kitchen is spacious and clean. The eating area adjacent to the kitchen has plenty of space. There is a small shaded patio area next to the kitchen, which is perfect for breakfast. There are herb pots you can help yourself to also!The rooftop area has views people would pay all kinds of crazy money for. There are sunbathing beds, tables and benches and plenty of sunlight to watch the world go by. The rooms are comfortable and fresh. We had a 6 dorm which had it’s own separate toilet and shower and sink.The only thing I would criticise, is the lack of towels, as we have stayed in few YHAs which have provided them, and also in the bathroom, there is no sanitary bin! This means you would have to walk out of the toilet holding whatever you used to put in the general bin outside. Not so great for hygiene, and also embarrassing if you’re sharing with other people. Great staff on reception. Tommy is always a delight!","September 14, 2018","13    Sydney Harbour YHA

737,"I was attracted by its location, the views it offered and the prices compared to hotels in the area. We stayed for eight nights. Overall, I was delighted with the experience and would recommend this place to families except for a couple of irritants.It was very easy to book online. The staff responded to any email queries within 30 minutes and were very helpful. The walk from Circular Quay involves quite a few steps as their web site warns. However, we were able to do it without too much of a problem with our 10 - 12 Kg bags and the views were worth it. We were able to store our bags as we reached too soon for check-in. The locker is not totally intuitive, but they had a staff member on hand to help us. They allowed us to use the shower too. There are a range of options for breakfast. They have combos for A$8 that includes average grocery store cereals and breads and excellent lattes (even with soy!). The staff are very friendly. You can make it a lot cheaper if you get your own ingredients from the nearby Coles and use their well-equipped kitchen and copious refrigerator space (the grocery store on the ground floor is an atrocious rip off!). There are near by fancier options! We used/combined all the options during our stay!The view from the premium room is excellent. The view from the terrace is just amazing! They have a lot of school groups and college students staying. However, we never heard loud noises. In fact, the large groups always used the stairs ensuring we never had to wait for the elevators too much! The location was wonderful for us. The bridge walk is within 3-4 minutes walk! The Observatory is within 10, botanical garden and Opera House about 15, Hyde Park about 20! Wulugul Path and the Barangaroo preserve are great for morning walk/jog. We were able to Uber to most places such as the Paddy Market, DH, or Kirribilli for $10-15 to conserve our limited energy to walk in those areas!The toilet paper is issued from a locked contraption that got jammed a few times and the night staff did not have a key for this contraption :(. However, they easily addressed it by giving us a roll! The windows don't stay shut unless you insert some wedges! I consider these minor irritants compared to the savings and the willingness of the staff to resolve the issues. Your tolerance could be different! The staff were not consistent in their ability to advice you on sightseeing. We were told on email that they could provide us with guides and maps for individual areas. However, when I asked someone at the front desk for some suggestions for the Hyde Park/Central area, I was told all they could give me was the city map and it was up to me to figure out what I wanted to see! On the other hand, other staffers were outstanding with suggestions for a rainy day or for picking the right BM tour! The bed for the third person was comfortable. Unless you plan to spend a lot of time in your room, the premium room is quite adequate for three (again, this is subjective). Clean spacious shower and a hot water supply that does not run out, and easily accessible even for those with bad knees. If your stay includes Fri-Sun, do not miss the Rocks market. We came across people from different countries of widely varying age groups. They were all very friendly. The staff were very friendly and super helpful -- when they were out of soy milk, they ran to the grocery shop and made my latte for me!!","June 26, 2018","13    Sydney Harbour YHA

738,"I stayed in this hostel for 3 nights in a 6-share private bathroom dorm. The room was clean, every bed has a separate power socket for charging your phone over night, and the bathroom facilities were nice and spacious. The rooftop view over Sydney Harbour is amazing and can challenge that of the expensive hotels. The location is perfect; walking distance to the Opera house and Circular Quay and the Rocks area is very lively (lots of pubs and restaurants) and cool. The only downside is the terrible WiFi. The free WiFi is only available near the reception and I couldn't get it to properly work for me. The premium in room WiFi is super expensive (compared to phone data). This holds for all YHA and I think this should be changed as a proper internet connection is almost a necessity for travellers nowadays to communicate or search for locations and places. Get an e-night pack with YHA if you want to stay here cheaply (30 dollars a night).","June 24, 2018","13    Sydney Harbour YHA

But it's not such a big deal once you realize you can just bring groceries back at the end of the day when you head back to the hostel.The staff were very friendly and helpful.

The main issue with this property, is that the much touted Air Conditioning is only turned on when there are very high temperatures outside (fine, that's logical), and can only be controlled from the front desk.This resulted in multiple trips up and down the stairs to plead with the staff to turn on the Air Con. The outside temp was well above the listed requirement, and yet we had to fight with them to get it turned on. I was then told that it would likely turn off after several hours and need to be reset.The staff was apathetic about the whole thing. I get that most Hostel staff are usually just travelling students, but you still should give a care about your job.","February 26, 2018","13    Sydney Harbour YHA

It is also a short stroll to the Opera House, the Botanic Gardens, the Quay and of course The Rocks area, places I like to visit when in Sydney. While I usually stay in one of the rooms with a shared bathroom, if intending to stay more than a few nights, I would recommend booking a room with an ensuite as there are more facilities. The rooms with a shared bathroom are very comfortable though and you do get a jug and tea/coffee/milk. Everything is meticulously clean and well-maintained while retaining the hotel's historic past.

Beautifully decorated and furnished in an old-world period theme with all the comforts of modern day living, fantastically balanced. We had a wee look at some of the other rooms, all are individually and beautifully styled on-point the old-world theme. To demonstrate the lengths the management have gone to to keep the vibe real, on the mantle-piece of the fireplace, next to the vase of beautiful fresh flowers, are 3 old books, in the front of one of the books, the certificate awarding the book to a young lady back in 1940, now that is genuine attention to detail. The hotel is perfect and the location is fantastic. A short walk across the road and down a few steps and you are at Circular Quay, the transport hub for ferries and trains.

Also, the breakfast is served in the old pub below the hotel, a nice assortment as a buffet. A special mention of the excellent service of both the employees that helped us.

If you make multiple trips to toilet in night this is particularly bad.Place is like a rabbit warren with multiple levels and short stairways. Bed has old flat springs and no box spring. No place in the room to hang towels which you take with you to and from the bathroom. Main entrance and reception on different levels, somewhat confusing. Overall, what one would would expect in a very cheap hotel, not one which charges as this ""Boutique Hotel"".","February 16, 2019","14    The Russell Boutique Hotel

799,"Well you know how it is, you spend hours on the internet looking for a hotel, but maybe are still dissapointed when you arrive. Well I was the same but I can honestly say this is one of if not the best choice I have ever made. It's basically a hotel of thirty some rooms above a pub on George Street right next to Sydney's Circular Quay for the Ferries, Opera House and Bridge. Our room had a big comfy bed , air-con and en suite shower room (but check first, rooms I believe varied) The complimentary continental breakfast was served in the pub and was a great start to the day. The staff are very friendly , thanks Gary and if like us you had come to Sydney to board a cruise the terminal is literally across the street and a two minute walk away.

First, the friendliness of the staff throughout the property and then the homeliness of the rooms and decor - which, furnished as they are, do make one feel at home. Add to that a welcoming and spacious ""Sitting Room"" just like there always used to be in hotels of yore, so it's not hard to see why I'm a fan.My only suggestion would be to make the availability of barista coffee at breakfast, even at additional cost, better publicised by signage in ""The Push"".

Be that as it may, this place that to be shared.1. You must want to stay in Bondi. 2. You are looking for an Australian beach house experience.If you tick yes to both these then look no further than the Bondi Beach House.It is short walk to the main beach front strip of Bondi and from there all of Bondi is within easy walking distance, the beach, restaurants, cafes, shops, the lot The longer majestic coastal walks , both north and south, begin and end here too.The accommodation is spotlessly clean and full of Aussie beach side character. It is not an impersonal 5 star hotel but an intimate personal home of your own for as long as you stay.All I can conclude is check out their website and book.

Since I didn't have a car I used public transportation the entire time. The 333 N Bondi bus stop was just a 2 minute walk away and provided excellent service in and out of the city as well as stops to get on the Airport rail (best to get an Opal card).

The bathroom and toilet were shared, and the shower was over the claw foot bath. The bathroom was also the laundry so could be a problem with everyone wanting to use the bathroom, toilet and laundry at the same time but this was not a problem for the two days that I was there. The house is coastal beach decor with lots of unique pieces of furniture and ornaments and I admired the lovely shiny floorboards. The breakfast is great , it is continental but included eggs, and toast jam, cereal and juice. The muesli I had was amazing full of fruit and nuts.

A further walk and there are plenty of shops including more food options, bars, bottle shops, and places for souvenirs.

825,"I just returned from 4 nights at Bondi Beach House and had the loveliest trip! I ended up choosing Bondi Beach House to avoid the solitude of my own AirBnb and the recklessness of a hostel.Highlights:- 1 block from Bondi Beach, with easy access to as many restaurants, bars and yoga studios you could ever need. Also near the beginning of the Bondi -> Cogee coastal walk.- Beautiful outdoor patios in the front and back of the house, good natural light.- Neighborhood is quiet at night and feels safe.- Included breakfast a nice perk, as well as personal storage in the communal fridge.- No issues with the wifi, plenty of beach towels to use and DVDs to watch if you want.Considerations:- This house isn't very accessible for someone with limited mobility due to the stairs at the front of the house and up to the kitchen.- The rooms are cozy (I was in the Wattle Room single) which suited my needs but may feel limiting if you have a lot of luggage or want a big room.- Ditto to what everyone said about the water from the shared shower getting all over the floor. Didn't really bother me, but felt weird leaving the place all wet after each shower.- Shared bathroom was also not too much of an issue except when the door would accidentally close and I'd be waiting for 30 mins not wanting to bother someone (when in reality it was unoccupied). I don't believe all of the rooms that shared the upstairs bathroom were occupied curing my stay, so it may feel busier at other times.- If you're a light sleeper you should bring some good earplugs. The wooden floors cause sounds to carry and if your room is on the 2nd floor off the kitchen you can hear everyone get up to eat in the morning.All in all I had a wonderful time and would stay at BBH again!","November 14, 2017","15    Bondi Beach House Accommodation

The breakfast is self serve so even though my husband doesn't usually like staying at Bed and Breakfast places because he doesn't like to eat breakfast and interact with strangers, he didn't mind this place. There's toast, eggs to cook, cereal, juice, coffee and tea. It's the same everyday which some night mind. The bed was comfortable and there's a ton of DVDS for free and even laundry which was a godsend for us traveling for two weeks. It's in a great location. Be sure to look up all the great restaurants around the area within walking distance and don't settle on the Italan one on the corner, although good, high priced for pasta. We loved the fresh market and Bonditony's Burger Joint. Also the Coastal Walk to Bronte for a great cup of coffee at Bogey. We would totally come back here!!

Perfect for this solo traveler!Flying in from the states I knew that I would arrived way before check in time ( flight arrived 6:30 am check in at 2 pm) so I alerted the the staff via email before I left the USA. With the ability to connect to wifi on Bondi beach (thank you Bondi Chamber of Commerce) I was able to check my email and Fenda had my room all ready and the key available ! The staff were knowledgeable and amiable. Donna and Fenda answered any questions I had and I must say the common spaces were always bright and clean. It felt like home. I would definitely recommend this to friends traveling to Sydney. I myself would stay there again in a heartbeat Thanks for a wonderful time Marty Huelsmann jr","May 15, 2017","15    Bondi Beach House Accommodation

836,Stayed here for four nights. Really feels like home. Positives: Very peaceful and quiet yet seconds from Bondi beach itself Help yourself breakfast so no need to feel rushed in the morning Big room (we stayed in 7) - attractive decor and very beach house esque Bus stop for Sydney CBD really close One possible improvement would be to have more on offer for breakfast given the price per night and offer an alternative than just full fat milk. Another night be to make the kitchen available for cooking at other times of the day. Thanks Bondi Beach House! ,"February 12, 2017","15    Bondi Beach House Accommodation

837,"Staying at the Bondi Beach House feels like staying with artistic, slightly bohemian relations. The house is full of delightful furnishings and art. The other things it has going for it are location (tucked in a quiet street but very near to the beach) and a beautiful garden. Our three day stay was quite expensive compared to say AirBNB and because of this I thought the breakfast was disappointing. You help yourself to cereal and toast, which is fine but it's sliced bread and there's no yogurt, fresh coffee etc. but this is pretty nit picky and as long as you don't go expecting hotel service or budget accommodation you won't be disappointed. We are Brits and £ is weak so this might have skewed our opinion.","January 29, 2017","15    Bondi Beach House Accommodation

The help-yourself breakfast suited us perfectly. Various lovely cereals, apples, tasty bread and eggs were provided. Also a selection of jams and spreads, orange juice, hot beverages. Whilst the self-catering aspect and communal dining room might not suit everybody, we felt it added to the informal, beach stay this B&B promotes. It is what it is. Pleasant, friendly place, lovely staff and good ambience. Try and stay in the en suite bedrooms overlooking the front of the house. They are spacious and airy.

839,"Bondi Beach House is just about perfect for us. We visited our son who lives on Bronti Beach and we stayed for two weeks with a weeks stay in Melbourne in the middle. The ladies (Fenda & Hazel) looked after our extensive cases while we travelled. The beach house is spotless and furnished with interesting pottery and pictures. Lovely to sit in the garden in the morning sun and enjoy a breakfast which is just right. Bondi Beach is one of the most famous beaches in the world but won't suit all people, for us it's an area full of life and surfing culture - you can sit and people watch all day.

859,"I stayed in the Frangipane suite. To be honest, the bathroom in that suite is a little hokey, and there's enough room in the suite to build it out a bit and remodel it so that you can move around a bit better. But this is a beach house, and you're here to go to the beach, and this place is a great option to high-end boring beige hotels and backpackers lodges (which seem to be the two available extremes.)The suite was quite big, lots of windows, french doors to the front deck, nice view. They have a screen available to put in the window so the other guests don't have a clear view into your room. You have to be kinda independent. You get an email telling you how to check in, there is ample food in the fridge for breakfast (there were plenty of eggs, fruit, milk and oj when I was there ... the extra eggs were on the bottom shelf of the fridge,) and equipment to cook a simple breakfast. If you want something fancy, you can buy stuff and keep it in the fridge or walk 20' to some excellent restaurants.The common spaces are big and airy, nice back yard, big frangipane tree that scents the whole place. The staff is rarely seen but helpful when they're there (they arranged my taxi to the airport.) But the real point of it is that it's a nice, clean, airy place that's close to the beach, the Iceberg pool, the coast walk, and steps from the bus that gets you into Sydney. It was perfect for my stay. The pluses definitely make me forgive the hinky bathroom (the mirror is over the toilet rather than the sink ... makes for tough shaving but, really, who needs to shave when you're on vacation at Bondi?)","March 15, 2016","15    Bondi Beach House Accommodation

860,"While the location can't be beat, our stay was just OK and, in my opinion, highly overpriced for the kind of accommodations we stayed in. My thoughts . . .Bedroom - Quirky 'artwork', hippy dippy style. Lots of natural light from louvered window. However, for privacy sake, kept them closed as there was another house directly next door. Small point, there were only 3 clothes hangars in a small stand-apart dresser of sorts. Thread bare and thin rugs on the floor.Bathroom - Miniature would be an understatement. The worse part was no shower curtain and no matter how you maneuvered yourself and the shower head, you always ended up with water all over the floor.Shared Kitchen - I have no problem sharing a kitchen with others, but for our entire five days there, a family of five made their way into the kitchen before everyone else and basically took over using all the eggs and most of the supplies. The O.J. was sub-par and the only fruit were apples that were, in my estimation, seconds--bruised and possibly only good for baking.The entrance towards the front door was up several steps and was constantly littered with the flowers that dropped because of the couple of days of rain during our stay. Yes, I can understand that this would happen, but it wasn't till three days into our stay that anyone even came by to clear the pathway. Very slippery.So called beach towels were thread-bare. As for caretakers, you never knew who they were. No one introduced themselves as such, and only on one day did I see someone who I took to be 'in charge', a term I use lightly.My overall feeling about this property is that you're paying for the location and not much else. They're certainly not putting all the $'s they take in to the upkeep of what could be such a memorable holiday vacation house. Unfortunately, it wasn't that for us, and I wasn't asking for much. But, when I pay a high $ rate, I expect a bit more than we experienced.","March 1, 2016","15    Bondi Beach House Accommodation

862,"I stayed five nights in the green room with my teenage daughter who was attending a course in Sydney. The room was cosy but comfortable, with a nice bed and good linens. The shared bathroom was always clean, and also has washing and drying facilities. The communal kitchen is lovely and the continental breakfast supplies were of high quality. We took advantage of the large dvd collection each night in our room. The property is decorated in a wonderfully electictic fashion with different artworks and many lovely books to enjoy. A stones throw to the beach, dining and shopping too. The staff who run the house are very nice, a special mention to Fenda who had a smile every morning. The only word of warning in this location is an apparent serial car keyer. I had to bring my vehicle to dive my daughter to her course each day so I booked a car space which was on the street. I always took care to park in my allocated space so as not impede anyone, however on the last evening a nasty piece of work severely damaged the paintwork on my car bonnet :( The property does have cctv but without the name and address of the culprit I still have to pay my insurance excess to have the repair. Of course this is not the fault of the beach house, Fenda was genuinely upset when I told her, as there had been keying problems in the street in the past. This is just something to keep in mind if you bring your vehicle. I will absolutely visit again, without my car! ","January 20, 2016","15    Bondi Beach House Accommodation

882,"S33°53'5.9"" E151°12'12.1” This hotel is a short 5 minutes’ walk from the south concourse of Sydney Central Station, between George and Lee St behind the Mercure Sydney hotel. On George St are many bars and restaurants, but Regent St is not a busy street. 57 Hotel is its sister hotel. This former Central Regent Street hotel underwent renovation in 2017. Our room 605 on the sixth floor in August and September 2018 was a twin room in the back of the hotel, with view on the platforms of Sydney Central Station. It has two comfortable beds, although a bit too short. The room had central air conditioning (windows could not be opened), television, fridge, iron and ironing board. Wi-Fi was good but not for streaming video. The bathroom had a shower and toilet. Housekeeping cleaned our room daily with new towels. The hotel offered simple breakfast in the small lobby downstairs with coffee, tea, muffins, cake and fruit. No juice. Enough to start the day. Car parking is available in the Mercure Hotel at the back of the hotel for AU$45 per day. We paid for the Max Twin room AU$162 per night in August 2018. We contacted them by e-mail and booked directly.For its central location, clean and modern room and simple breakfast, 28 Hotel offered a very competitive price in Sydney CBD.

922,"Good location close to Central Station.Lovely spacious rooms and comfortable bed. Fantastic ‘media hub’ option in rooms so that you can plug in your device to stream shows of your choice.Coffee machine in room and 2 bottles of water per day. Small fridge available for personal use. Much appreciated glass of bubbles upon arrival.Before check out we were going to drop our rating of hotel due to poor room cleaning on our final day (had no other issues on any other day) and Reception were fairly disinterested in our complaint. Upon checkout, however, the lady on reception was mortified at our complaint and called the manager over immediately. The manager apologised profusely, offered her business card and asked that should we return again, she would try to personally organise an upgrade. It left us feeling much happier about the one mistake. I would highly recommend this lovely hotel.","July 2, 2019","17    Four Points by Sheraton, Sydney Central Park

923,"Im not much of a writer and in fact I have not been posting on Tripadvisor. I have missed writing many many reviews, however this hotel made me go back on tripadvisor and compelled to write this review. First of all I think this hotel is perfect value. Second of all its in the heart of Sydney without being congested in downtown CBD. Parking was indoor at afair price. Hotel was new. Next to malls, restaurants and a park. The whole Central Park Area is a relatively new development.One name Id like to jot down is our man than Henrich Varga, he just seems to solve our problems. We had issues with our room (was not hotels fault there was construction) Henrich made sure we were given choises of other rooms and everything was taken care of.Great hotel! In fact one of the best I have stayed. Its just an overall satisfying hotel. Trust me Ive stayed in hotels five times the price, like the one im currently staying in right now as I type this review, but different satsifaction level. Four points thank you! I will come back!

932,"We absolutely loved this hotel!It’s location is fantastic. We love to wander around Surrey Hills, which is only a short walk away. In general, it is a very well connected hotel. You can get busses to most destinations further afield such as Bondi. The City Centre is also easily walkable. In terms of facilities nearby, you’re on the doorstep of Central Park Mall, which has fashionable clothes shops. There is also a chemist, Woolworths, and plenty of eateries to grab a bite for lunch or dinner.We were upgraded to a suite room. We had originally asked for the suite upgrade but as the hotel was busy they couldn’t accommodate our request for a couple of days, but nonetheless they eventually moved us into a great room. We’d say it’s one of our favourite rooms of the places we’ve stayed (which includes the Ritz Carlton in Singapore). Okay, it’s not particularly the Ritz but it had everything we needed. A walk in wardrobe, a huge bathroom with double sinks, a sofa to watch Tv. More importantly, the room was quiet and the bed comfyness scale would be a 10/10. The only gripes against the hotel are that (1) the fried eggs at breakfast were usually cold despite being placed under the hot lamp (we noticed that when the kitchen were frying the eggs, the cooked eggs were left on the side on a plate to get cold, and by the time they reached the hot lamp, the eggs would not get hot enough), (2) the music in the breakfast room sometimes felt like you were entering a rave party or a drum n bass event (we mentioned the music to a member of staff but he said there is nothing they could do) - there were quite a few guest a little disturbed by the music.Generally, we loved this hotel. The staff are absolutely fantastic and welcoming. We would certainly stay again.","May 1, 2019","17    Four Points by Sheraton, Sydney Central Park

Really this was so disappointing, I just did not have time to speak to anyone, but honestly if that’s the best upgrade you can offer - no thanks. Lost a star for that, you should have asked me if this room was ok for me, not just fob me off with it. Actually as I’m writing this it’s making me more disappointed so I’m taking another one off.

947,"What makes a great stay? They almost nailed it. Location: 8/10It really depends on your trip's objective. This hotel is chucked in a corner that is pretty quiet yet vibrant. 7 minutes walk from Central station and within 30min walk to darling harbor and Sydney harbour. 15min walk to Chinatown. Not too bad! The neighborhood is filled with students, hence the vibrancy. Rooms: 7/10Reasonably sized for their standard room. Most switches and facilities were designed with practicality in mind. One thing to note though: they do not loan adaptors for free. They'd charge you $15 to buy one. That's pretty unwelcoming for me Service: 10/10Really top notch. Everyone's at their best! The check in was a breeze. Despite arriving at 9am, she tried her best to allocate a room that is available. A shout out to Wallace and Shailendra at the bar! Really great guys who made the stay more enjoyable. The bar is also quite a good place to chill and chat up with fellow travelers. Who needs a hostel when you have a bar here?Yang from the front desk had been very friendly too! Engaged the customers and I felt at home. Food: 7/10The breakfast selection is quite basic, but they cook up pretty good poached eggs upon request. I didn't try lunch nor dinner there though Platinum members are recognised by 2 drinks voucher per stay. Not too good compared to other properties given the absence of a lounge. Value: 6/10The property is quite pricy given it's facilities. At some time, it's even as expensive as Westin Hotel in the city. But I think the cabin crews that stays here helped to keep the occupancy up. ","February 15, 2019","17    Four Points by Sheraton, Sydney Central Park

950,"Being a new hotel we expected a really great experience. Unfortunately, this was not the case. We knew we would not be able to check in after our cruise ship docked in the morning but we weren't prepared for the chaos at check in at about 11am. Very crowded, very small lobby with a total of 4 check in stations and no concierge desk. Only 3 people were woking checkin. When we finally got to the front of the line and were told our rooms would be ready about 3pm. OK no problem. We were then advised we would have rooms with king size beds.We were a party of 8 with 4 rooms booked. We had requested 2 rooms with 2 queens because we were women sharing rooms but didn't plan on sharing beds and 2 kings for 2 couples. We had requested queen beds when we made the reservations in July. We were advised they never get this information in advance from hotels.com and that they wouldn't be able to accommodate our request but could give us twins. Also, they didn't have the correct names. We were advised they were oversold and very busy. Really? Off we went to sight see after checking our luggage. When 4 of us returned to check in after 3pm only 1 rooms was ready. We were told the other would be ready in 15 minutes. Again no problem. After 2 hours and still no room I called down to ask for the manager. After being put on hold and then begin disconnected we went to the front desk and asked for the manager. He arrived and said he knew we had been cut off. After a discussion about the room at about 515 we got the 2nd room. There were 3 elevators for a 16 plus story hotel and one of those elevators was out 2 of the 3 days we stayed. One of our group returned one evening atfter 6pm only to find their room had never been cleaned and my room looked like it hadn't been vacuumed in weeks. While new the hotel has had 8 months to get their stuff together. The lobby is inadequate, there should be a concierge and generally wouldn't recommend this hotel.","February 7, 2019","17    Four Points by Sheraton, Sydney Central Park

951,"This hotel was a wonderful experience due to staff and new rooms. The staff was incredibly friendly and helpful from the moment they said welcome to Four points Sheraton. Rooms are new, spacious and clean. I was awarded an immediate upgrade due to being Gold Elite status with SPG. My room was 1803, on the very top floor with a view of the City. There is fast internet on the hotel premises and many TV channels if you stay in your room. Four points is located a few steps away from a Starbucks, Bus and the Central Train station. There is a mall next to the hotel and incredible areas to explore or attend a tour. If you need to go anywhere far and don’t like using public transportation, Uber is the best in Sydney. Uber’s are quick to pickup, accurate, friendly and super clean cars. If you are staying longer than a day purchase an Opal card to get you around. Sunday’s are the best for taking trains, busses or ferries as the maximum charge on Sunday’s is $2.70 all day long. I would like to thank the front desk staff of Four Points for their courtesy and professionalism. Staff such as you are the reason customers return to your hotel.

952,It’s 2 days into our stay and I can write off this hotel. The main gripe is with the service. The pulling rod is detached from the night curtain. I reported it on the first day upon check in and also requested for dental and shaving kits. We returned after several hours and nothing was fixed. The amenities came after a few calls to housekeeping. The curtain was still not fixed as of writing. General service was average and not particularly warm. Poor housekeeping. Breakfast spread was limited but probably in line with a 4* property. Location is at the city fringe but rates seems to be a premium.

Central Park Mall where there are lots of shopping and dining opportunities plus a supermarket is adjacent to the hotel. Stayed there for 10 days. Affordable prices. Breakfast was included. Buffet style. The chef was very helpful and friendly. Each day they prepared freshly cooked hashbrowns upon request. Appreciated it much. Disappointingly the soft boiled eggs went overcooked sometimes. Our room was on higher floor but the view wasn't justified the additional money paid. Better save the charge for somewhere else. It is newly opened in late 2018. Everything was new and clean. However the staff wasn't very professional. They forgot to refill the coffee capsules on most of the days and even omitted to servicing the room for 1 day until asked to do so. Apart from that we still enjoyed the stay. ,"January 28, 2019","17    Four Points by Sheraton, Sydney Central Park

955,"Only 4-6 months old in he newly renovated precinct of Sydney beyond Central Station, the Central Mall area. From what was Carlton United Breweries sit through to Abercrombie this whole area is a buzz with restaurants, cheap Asian fare at Spice Alley, cinemas and eateries in Central Mall. So amazing location close to city and central station.Front desk staff a little slow with check-in despite my checking in via the Marriott App.... it still took a little time. Rooms, foyer including an outdoor seating area are wonderful. Rooms really modern and sleek design, small-ish bathroom for 2 but still adequate. Not a fan of the pillows available with a chronic neck thing...l couldn’t get the neck comfortable. Good housekeeping once a day so our 3 night stay was very comfortable.Do miss the pool and the gym has limited weights machinery choices.","January 26, 2019","17    Four Points by Sheraton, Sydney Central Park

957,"My husband (Mario) and I and one of our buddies (Rolando) stayed at this property November 2018. The hotel was only operating for a few months when we arrived; however, the front desk and housekeeping had everything running smoothly.We caught an Uber from SYD to the hotel (about AUD $47 for a SUV) early on Sunday morning. When we arrived at the hotel Maria at the front desk greeted us and checked us in. Maria answered all of our questions about the property and the surrounding area. She was extremely friendly and delivered the ""gold standard"" of a customer experience. This property is lucky to have her! Rolando also confirmed that the hotel received his request for a ""featherless room"" because he is allergic to down feathers, and they were able to accommodate!  After checking our bags with the bell hop, we checked our bags and started exploring Sydney. The area the hotel is in is very safe and across from the University of Sydney Technology campus and an indoor shopping mall called Central Park (Tip: There is a liquor and wine/beer store on the bottom level of the mall).Darling Harbor was only about a 15 minute walk and has plenty of options for touristy things to do and places to eat. After about two hours of exploring, we received a call from Maria saying that our rooms were ready.The rooms are very clean, comfortable, and were our oasis after touring Sydney every day. I was hesitant about this property at first, given that there weren't many reviews at the time, but after staying here, we would definitely return again. The property does have a full service bar and restaurant, but we ventured out for our meals and drinks.We pre-booked an Uber for our return trip to the airport, but unfortunately after waiting half and hour past the pick up time the driver was a no-show. Maria saw the distress we were going through and offered to help arrange transportation to the airport. Kudos to Maria made sure we were comfortable throughout our stay!PRO TIP: Since this is a new hotel, your Uber would turn at the ""Adidas"" exterior sign, as if going into the mall; then make a right to get to the hotel entrance.","January 15, 2019","17    Four Points by Sheraton, Sydney Central Park

958,"We stayed a total 9 days while in Sydney. We arrived 9am after a long flight and they were kind enough to accommodate my early check-in request. The rooms were new, spacious and comfortable. Super location - less than 10 minutes to Central Station (train to/from Airport), less than 2 minutes to Central Park shopping mall (Daiso, Cinema, Woolies, food court, clothing shops, restaurants), about 10-minute walk to Broadway shopping mall (Target, food court, K-mart, Coles, etc), about 15 minute walk to Paddy's Market, Chinatown and less than 20 minute walk to Fish Market. Front staff and service staff were super friendly and accommodating. Breakfast buffet had lots of choices. Close enough to CBD but without the hustle, bustle and crowds.

959,"A new hotel opened about 6 months , staff generally very friendly & professional. Lobby is very welcoming, clean with a nice scent. Room is spacious and bed is comfortable, and most importantly, quiet. You hardly hear movements except usage of water from your neighbours.Next to hotel is a mall with lots of eateries and supermarket. 3 mins walk away is an alley full of food called Spice Alley. All decor very modern. I feel like I am in a transformed Europe. I would also like to take this opportunity to mention Mauro who handled my checkout , fast & efficient and especially Ankur, the duty manager who also helped to give options to my requests which were not being able to accede to. He could have ended with a no, but he went on to help me explore other possible solutions. That’s the spirit of a manager. ","January 10, 2019","17    Four Points by Sheraton, Sydney Central Park

I have sent loads of emails to the hotel, to the Marriott and SPG email accounts, posted on Social Media, filled out complaints forms, spoken to people on the phone and they still have not responded.Absolute worst customer service I have experienced.

963,"I stayed at this hotel for a number of nights in early December. Visiting family, I was searching for a hotel with reasonable rates and came across the new Four Points which was having introductory rates. It's new and modern, but located a bit outside the main tourist areas. Whilst the location was fine for me as I knew my way around, visitors to the city may prefer paying more for a hotel closer to the harbour.- The hotel is located about 10 minutes walk from central station. Walking at night is generally safe despite the number of bars you pass along the way. From the harbour, it would about a 30 minute walk.- The area surrounding is primarily a university area. There are plenty of eating and drinking options, as well as numerous modes of public transport nearby.- Staff at the hotel were friendly and efficient. Check in was seamless.- The hotel has only been a few months when I stayed and it showed. Rooms had all the modern facilities - plenty of usb outlets around the room.- The bathroom was clean and was of a good size. Different from some other Four Points I have stayed, this one offered travel size toiletries rather than from pump dispensers.- I had a room facing the apartment block next door. Needless to say, it was necessary to keep the curtains closed.- The one minor annoyance was the lack of a kettle in the room. It meant trying to use the coffee pod machine to heat water for a cup of tea.Overall, this was a great option for my stay in Sydney. If the price was right, I would happy to return to this hotel.","December 27, 2018","17    Four Points by Sheraton, Sydney Central Park

965,"Booked this property due to it being part of the Starwood Group, plus its quite new and also in a good location. Really glad I did as it met all my requirements. Service is generally good, restaurant is nice and facilities are generally good. I suppose in summary, its a nice 4 star property, thats priced reasonably well by Sydney standards. What I liked most was the shopping and restaurants in the area, that were all a very easy stroll from the hotel. It was great to not have to go into the city, and just explore this local area which has everything you need.","December 10, 2018","17    Four Points by Sheraton, Sydney Central Park

966,"Like all hotels in central Sydney, room rates are on the high side. But you get a good Four Points hotel that meets the brand’s high standards for functionality, efficiency, and cleanliness. Slightly stylish, and I liked their al fresco hang out areas at the lobby level. Even though they’re right by Broadway, the sounds of traffic and passer-bys walking past don’t feel intrusive.I was there for business nd had a rental car. Unfortunately, the hotel website doesn’t give you heads up that although their address is on Abercrombie Street, there is no drop off point on Abercrombie, nor is the car park entrance on Abercrombie. Google Maps also took us to Abercrombie. Here’s how to get to the hotel car park:1. If you’re already on Abercrombie, turn right on Broadway.2. University of Technology should now be on your left.3. Take first right onto Chippendale Way, before The Central Park Mall4. Turn right on Central Park Avenue, and the entrance to the underground car park should be on your right before the road turns left. There is an easy-to-miss sign saying that it is the hotel car park. The shutters to the parking garage will be down.5. Drive up to the intercom, and buzz the front desk to let you in. Even as a guest, you’ll need to do that each time you enter. Your room key will not work.6. Drive all the way down, following the signs to Hotel parking.7. At B2 (or whichever basement level the signs indicate), the signs become confusing. You’ll see another barrier arm. Look for the intercom on one of the pillars before the arm, and you’ll need to buzz yourself in a second time. Again, room keys don’t work.8. Once through the barrier, turn left and you should see the lifts to the lobby on your right.9. Park.Parking is expensive. $40 per night, but you can drive in and out all day with no extra charges.","December 9, 2018","17    Four Points by Sheraton, Sydney Central Park

969,"We stayed last night at this property as my daughter had a dance concert. I booked a rate with breakfast via Expedia. My friend was also staying and our daughters wanted to be close to each other. I sent a message to the hotel after the 3rd time sending I finally got a reply to say that we are next door excellent. We arrive at 3.45 and was told our room was not ready housekeeping was cleaning our room next door to my friend, we where asked to have a seat and we where offered some sparkling wine ok great start. After maybe 20 minutes I went to ask how much longer I was then served by the duty manager who said the guest extended so we have to move rooms. He tried to tell me they just extended Im 99% sure that in the 20 minutes we waited when the cleaner was supposed to be in the room they didnt extend. The worst thing is being lied to by staff especially managment. The solution was my friend who had already checked in move rooms or we go 2 floors up then suddenly we had a room apparently across the hallway. So our room was 1402 my friend 1407 yes the same floor but one end of the floor to the other not across the hall as promised why lie to us. The shower set up is ridiculous the hand held is at the tap level or a rain shower with limited pressure. You are given just 2 towels so if you want an extra to dry your hair or anything you have to call for more doesnt make sense have at least one spare. Breakfast was our next challenge our room came with breakfast but only for 2 my 8 year old who eats next to nothing, I very rarely have to pay when she is eating with two adults because she has next to nothing I was told I had to pay $17 I was not going to pay $18 for a bowl of cereal I asked if I could do al a carte but all I can get on that is add on so for $6 she got 5 hash browns really what a waste the girl just said 5-12 kids must pay half price I get a 10-12 year old but small kids eat next to nothing the breakfast is extremely basic and very uninspiring and no way worth the $35 they expect people to pay, go across the road and the shopping centre has a great food court and loads of options and good cafes.... Such a disappointing and underwhelming stay I would neither recommend this property or stay again. Look at some of the other options close by for im sure a much more inspiring stay","December 2, 2018","17    Four Points by Sheraton, Sydney Central Park

970,"As my return journey from regional NSW back home was cancelled, I found myself stuck in Sydney due to storms. So the hotel was a last minute choice.Well after a long day it was a relief to stay at a very comfortable hotel.First Impressions very good, reception is at the Central Park Ave end of the building. However, the ground floor layout is 24hr reception, long central foyer leading to the bar and ultimately the breakfast area fronting the street Broadway.Its modern in style but comfortable and relaxing. To sum up:-Room is a reasonable size and the bathroom is large and contemporary.Bed was at the cusp of being firm but very comfortable, the same goes for the pillows. I slept very well.Shower was at a perfectly set temperature. The usual number of towels for a king size room. Modern connections, usb near the bedhead and at the desk.Desk chair was comfortable to sit in but not so the chairs at the foot of the bed.I used the train to/fro from the airport and hotel is 500m, an easy walk from Central station.It is close to spice alley and eateries in the Central Park Mall.Overall i really enjoyed my short stay here.

However after 5 minutes of sitting on the bed we found a bed bug. On further inspection of the sheets we found blood stains. We went straight back down to reception to ask for a full refund (we had paid for two nights) After explaining that we have found a bed bug the member of staff said that he wanted to move us to another room - however we did not want to risk staying somewhere which could be potentially infested with bed bugs as we were due to rent a camper van after our stay in Sydney and did not want to infest that and all our clothes.After pushing a little bit he did finally agree to give us a refund for the second night. He then proceeded to follow us up to our room and then upon inspection of the bedbugs and stains that we had found he then refunded us for the entire stay.The staff member did deal with the situation very well but we would not book to stay here again.","January 25, 2019","18    Central Railway Hotel

One of the best ever. The room on the first floor faced Chalmers Street and has a decent sized balcony. I was concerned about traffic noise at first, but it was hardly audible and I slept right through without any disturbance.The tariff was very reasonable for a city hotel and my only gripe was the $35 paid for parking. It is a burden that us visitors from the country or interstate get slugged for whereas tourists who fly in don't.

997,"I got there late at night (10pm) but the reception closes at 8pm. They called earlier to confirm I was coming and left the key for me in a safe deposit box. All good, no problem.As others have said, there is no lift so if you’ve got mobility issues ask for a ground floor room. The stairs are not onerous, just 2 flights up to the top.Room was ok. A little old and needs a facelift but ok for a couple of nights. Room was nice and big with plenty of room for 3 people (even though I was there alone). Room also has a fridge, sink, microwave oven, kettle, tea & coffee if you want to do some self-catering.Bathroom was small and, again, could probably do with some renovation. Shower was good.On the downside, whilst it had free wifi it was fairly useless for anything more than slow web browsing. TV was useless too….very dark screen and I couldn’t figure out how to adjust it.As others have said, there is no restaurant there so organise breakfast before you go to bed, unless you’re prepared to get up and go out searching for something to eat. I didn’t notice any restaurants close by.Now, a big Warning…..I booked this hotel online, through their website on a Wednesday evening. On Friday morning I had a call from my bank to tell me that someone was using my credit card (not the physical card). I hadn’t used my card anywhere else in the past few days so I suspect it was stolen from their website. The bank can’t confirm either. The card needed to be cancelled which was a major pain.I reported this to the lady when I checked out (Tuesday morning) but as of now (Wed evening) I haven’t heard anything back from them. No explanation, no apology. So, be warned. You may want to book through a 3rd party like Tripadvisor to protect your credit card details.Bottom line….Hotel was ok. Price was good but you get what you pay for. Personally I wouldn’t stay there again, there are better places for slightly more money.","October 9, 2018","18    Central Railway Hotel

There is a half dozen or so steps to get to reception then depending on which floor you are on it could be four sets of stairs or so to get to your room. It is a real turn off. The young girl on reception was very helpful and helped with our bags however I did think it was going to be a OH &S problem for her sooner rather than later. Walking distance to Central Railway and Pitt street, but go to the loo before you go because you won't find a loo with Cooee. If you have luggage find somewhere else.

Supermarkets and bus/train stations are nearby. 2) Room - Okay for 2-3 days of stay. Apt interiors. Felt wash room was quite small. Private balcony was plus. Has got basics such as microwave, kettle, mini bar etc. 3) Service - Room service was prompt and things were getting replenished/replaced daily. Front desk was friendly. Check in and check outs were smooth. Housekeeping was up to mark. 4) Amenities - Quite a limited space, so nothing much to offer except a small open area where a group can sit and have coffee. Parking is paid. Wifi connectivity was good. NO ELEVATOR, a big minus. No in house restaurant. Overall a good budget friendly hotel for those who wants to stay closer to the CBD. Can be recommended for young people, who are looking for a shorter stay. ","August 12, 2018","18    Central Railway Hotel

1031,"Jazzed up around three years ago this place is playing on its inner city location well, with hints of converted warehouse with exposed beams and brickwork. Strikes he it's always been a hotel or guesthouse but maybe it had an earlier life. It is in the old trading heart of Haymarket and Chinatown. That's the point after all, it's slap bang in the heart of Chinatown. Food everywhere, fun walks down Dixon street (keep going across Goulburn Street and enjoy the modern Asian street feel with beautiful stylish kids eating and promenading. There's an issue though with huge single use plastic waste that needs dealing with urgently coz after all the Harbour is just a drain away. But the buzz is great. The hotel is right there in it and is full of character and has a boutiquey feel. We took a two single plus big queen bed room which was spacious enough for the four of us to move about and the beds were SO, SO COMFORTABLE!!! They're great. The rest of the layout was fairly basic but kinda chic. Being so in the middle of it meant there was a fair bit of street noise at night. That disturbed our sleep a bit but not really an issue. Breakfast was on offer and could be pre-booked for $10.50 pp. Slightly more if ordered on the day but very reasonable prices and a range of nice options to choose from. We didn't get our act together in time though. You can go down and eat there in the lobby or in your room. Check in and out easy. A good 24hr parking deal at $35. All around a good experience.There are room with their own terraces. I might do on of them next time. ","June 30, 2019","19    The Ultimo

1041,"There is so much right about this hotel - the location, the price and the look and feel, all great for a budget hotel in Sydney. However the one bad thing had such a massive effect that it tends to dull all these super great traits. It's the noise....urrrgghhh the noise! I'm talking I-had-earplugs-in type street noise and still only managed about an hours sleep. The kids can sleep through a cyclone (well the closest we have come), but even they tossed and turned through the night. I have full and utter appeciation with the fact that we were staying in the city of Sydney and that the city does not often sleep, however we stay in town alot...I mean a real lot. And aside from noisy guests walking past your room every now and then in other hotels, this was like we had our beds set up outdoors in the middle of George Street. It looks like the hotel has done what they can, but they mustn't have in reality, in saying that I don't know what the soloution is.We had breakfast in our room and it was yum. Unlike other reviews, we had a family room and it was definately spacious enough. Facilites all good, little musty smelling on arrival upstairs and in the room, but either got used to it or is went away.","June 11, 2019","19    The Ultimo

They accommodated an early check-in after our long flight and also upgraded our room the second visit. The location is accessible to all that you would like to see in Sydney. The rooms were clean (albeit small), but perfect for what we needed. Beds were very comfortable and coffee was great, as others have mentioned. My one and only feedback is that the hairdryer in room seemed to have a too short cord for outlet placement. Not a deal breaker, but figured worth mentioning.

It was lovely to be upgraded to a bigger room but I was really disappointed that the room didn't have any of the bare brick type different features, which was why I had chosen to stay here, our room felt boxy - but after asking if they had another room our bags were promptly moved to a lovely 'bricky' room for us (unfortunately that was above a very loud karaoke bar which went on til very late the first night, but was much quieter the next nights thankfully!). Breakfast delivered to our room was a nice change and we loved the choices available - lovely & healthy. Short walk into the city or short walk to Central Station to get the train. We liked the location but it is quite a hectic area by chinatown.

Ultimo sent an email prior to my stay asking if I wanted to upgrade as I was in one of the smaller rooms. The location is great. It's within walking distance to Central Station, near a Starbucks, and across from a mall. The street is fairly busy. As I was trying to sleep a garbage truck pulled up alongside my room. The noise was annoying but temporary. The room had double panes in an effort to combat the noise. Besides for this, I slept well and woke up well rested for my long flight the next morning. There was something odd on the floor - stairs (about 4 steps). It may be in issue for some with luggage.

The staff is friendly, but I don't get the astrology thing--seems like a hokey gimmick.The room is ok but there is no space to put anything--no drawers, shelves, or cupboard of any kind. Just some hanging rack from IKEA that fits maybe 10 shirts and a small surface in front of the TV. Maybe it's not a place meant for families, but this lack of storage was a huge problem for my family of 4 with a toddler and baby who like to pull things (like a heavy iron) from the low shelves. The bathroom was nice, but the floor was not angled properly and water did not make its way to the floor drain. The water also gets incredibly hot--like near boiling.

Friendly reception staff, the room was a decent size, the look of the distressed brick was good, the bed was comfortable, room modern and up to date. The first night was quiet, the second was a lot noisier (outside?). Recommend requesting higher floor (it is not a high rise) It would be nice to have a safe in the room, but alas too trendy for a cupboard, you can have a rack instead. Sorry but you can toss the stuff about being an astrology hotel. Rubbish. .

One thing to note is that if you are a light sleeper there is a bit of traffic (both foot and vehicles) and with single pain glass windows it doesn’t quite block out the noise, but this didn’t bother me at all.

Easy transport in the area and walking distance to most attractions etcThe front desk staff are great to deal with and nothing is a problem they all go above and beyond.

1080,"I am reasonably accustomed to Hiltons appearing to have smaller-than-average rooms for a hotel chain of its status. The rooms at West Hotel didn't let me down with a tiny space, tiny hanging space for clothes, tiny desk and tiny bathroom all complimented by tiny (and uncomfortable) casual sitting options. Views out of the window were glimpses of Darling Harbour intruded upon by the architectural external facade on the windows.My check-in staff member was gruff and clearly had not remembered simple things at training like eye contact, smiling, using the guests name, and challenging interactions such as 'please' and 'thank you'. Really, really wants to make you walk out and go elsewhere.This hotel does NOT have on-site parking to be aware.Bar staff and the breakfast staff were one bright spot on what was a very disappointing experience.","July 10, 2019","20    West Hotel Sydney, Curio Collection by Hilton

1081,"The West hotel is well located, being at the bridge end of central Sydney, which makes getting to most spots of interest a doable proposition. While most large chain hotels are usually mean spirated and notoriously stingy, tending to nickle and dime customers for everything, the West Hotel were surprisingly generous. The rooms are well appointed and have amenities such as a chromecast on the TV as well as integrated in-room bluetooth speakers. The addition of a pod esspresso machine and complimentary meusili bars/popcorn also sweetens the deal somewhat. Add to this cheerful, chatty and helpful staff and there is a lot to like.

They needed about 30min to get my room ready and within 5 min walk you are at Darlinghurst harbour and can pick up some fresh coffee. They mentioned they would put my luggage in my room, however on my return and getting my key, I found out when I arrived in my room, my luggage was still somewhere in storage.Have not tried any of their facilities (restaurant, fitness) as it was a quick 2 day business trip but it is a good hotel for a business stay.","July 3, 2019","20    West Hotel Sydney, Curio Collection by Hilton

The bar/breakfast room layout is attractive and the breakfast is great.The hotel doesn't have it's own parking, but partners with a garage right across the street. Ask the hotel receptionist for how to proceed.The best thing by far about this hotel is the location - you can walk to a lot of the key attractions and you're very close to a ferry terminal that'll take you to Manly beach and other locations you might want to see. The hotel is also a short walk away from the closest metro station.Will definitely stay here the next time I come to Sydney.","June 20, 2019","20    West Hotel Sydney, Curio Collection by Hilton

1087,"I stayed three nights while solo in Sydney and picked the West because of its location close to Barangaroo and its modern and stylish look.The staff are really excellent - friendly and efficient. My requests for room service and an iPhone charger were met quickly and accurately. I was always greeted with a smile and kind word as I moved in and out of the hotel and the housekeeping staff always did a fabulous job.My main issue was with the room itself. They look fabulous with really funky carpet and stylish bed linens, but the rooms are very small and have very little storage. My large suitcase did not fit on the luggage rack, so I had to put it on the only armchair and ottoman and because there is no wardrobe, I had to live out of my suitcase rather than putting everything away, like I usually do.The bed was very comfortable, but the only bedding supplied was the bottom sheet on the mattress and a quilt. No top sheet, no blankets in the (non-existent) wardrobe, that's it. Even with my aircon turned down to 18 degrees I was still hot and didn't sleep very well. The hard, lumpy pillows were very uncomfortable too, and probably didn't help. Feathers are not always a luxury option! I didn't ask if housekeeping could provide me with other bedding. Perhaps if I had a top sheet and blanket might have been forthcoming.The bathroom was lovely with stylish fittings and a rain shower which was high enough for my tall stature. I would have liked to be able to turn the pressure up, though, but the tap didn't allow for this. Nice toiletries, though.The hotel is close to Barangaroo, so your lunch and dinner options are plentiful. But be warned, very few eateries are open for breakfast, and most of the ones that do serve breakfast don't open early (at least not on a Sunday). There are few options for weekend breakfasts around the hotel - it's predominantly office buildings and any cafes are closed on weekends - so you might find your only option for breakfast is the hotel restaurant, unless you're prepared for a long walk.This hotel didn't really suit my needs for a 3-day stay and I think I'll choose something a bit closer to the centre of the CBD next time.","June 17, 2019","20    West Hotel Sydney, Curio Collection by Hilton

1091,"The hotel was quite new and modern. Very clean. The location was absolutely perfect as we were going on a Vivid dinner harbour cruise and it was right around the corner. We stupidly went down to breakfast and there were 3 options: a continental breakfast $30, continental plus something from the menu $39, or just something from the menu. We ordered the 'full' $39 breakfast. But our meals were terrible - the eggs benedict was on burnt english muffins, the sauce was congealed and clearly not freshly made and there was only a small dollop on each egg. I ordered smashed avo with feta and pomegrante seeds with poached eggs. I couldn't eat it - the avo was tasteless and there was no feta. The latte was an extra $5 and was tiny.Then they had the hide to charge a surcharge for paying with a credit card!! I only found out when I got the email receipt later that day. No one mentioned it at the time, and really, who pays their hotel bill with cash? We should have walked back to Darling Harbour and eaten.

1099,"From the moment we arrived to the moment we left I was completely disappointed with West Hotel.At check in they couldn’t find my reservation and weren’t bothered to look for it even though we were staying in a suite. No apologies given. We were here to celebrate our wedding anniversary but I had neglected to alert them of this fact but I figured when asked why were staying I’d let them know. Of course they weren’t interested enough to ask.The room is small for a suite, though it looks pleasant enough. Except for the scratches all over the floor, the door that doesn’t close properly between the rooms, noisy aircon, no lighting to do your make up or a backlight to shave, the bath was tiny and synthetic, towels were not soft and fluffy, the pillows were all big and long, the light in the lounge room was crooked, and you could only watch normal TV if u didn’t pay for internet which is ridiculous for a suite(your already paying for a premium room).We could hear the neighbours doors opening and shutting all night.The bed was comfortable and loved the music throughout the suite but that’s it.Even breakfast was horrible, burnt toast with two poached eggs with a piece of mushroom and a piece of tomato and no butter offered.Once seated we waited for at least 5mins if not longer for someone to come and serve us. Eventually I gave up and went to the bar to order coffees as I was sick off waiting.When the waitress eventually came over I was told off for ordering my coffee and not waiting.Checkout was very impersonal.Would never recommend to anyone or stay there again.","May 11, 2019","20    West Hotel Sydney, Curio Collection by Hilton

1105,"This hotel clearly was an ambitious project for Hilton, emphasizing sleek modern design in an excellent location for a target audience of high-end business folks traveling light for short stays. Amenities, including a stylish, very appealing bar and restaurant, and the friendly, efficient, well-informed staff, add a lot to the experience of being here. That said, the hotel works less well for those here on longer trips traveling with family members and more luggage. It comes down to this: there is space to stash the contents of an overnight bag or smallish suitcase, and that's about it. Here, below, is a detailed ""look"" at our room. Skip and SCROLL DOWN TO ""BOTTOM LINE"" if you prefer a quick read. There's a small table to enjoy room service or an in-room make-it-yourself coffee/tea, but it has only one chair. You can pick up and move the little ottoman that goes with a modestly plush side chair by the bed, so that two people can squeeze in. But it's cramped. In fact, the eye-popping design of this room makes the most of quite a limited amount of space. Our room, a ""king deluxe plus"" on the 5th floor, was pretty small for the two of us. It was lovely to look at, except for the clutter that resulted from the lack of drawers, shelves and closet space, and the fact that we seemed constantly to be bumping into each other when going about our normal business. The bath, being roomier with a wonderful walk-in shower, was a plus. So was the very helpful staff, who brought an extra luggage rack and more hangers to add to the 4 that were there. Even so, we ended up cramming one of our wheeled suitcases under the night table in an effort to get it out of view and out of the way. Back to the room, there is a single wardrobe-type piece of furniture that looks to have space for clothing and personal effects. But it doesn't. Of the two drawers, one has the safe in it. There is a low side compartment that would do well with shelves for folded clothes, but it houses the refrigerator. The floor-to-ceiling compartment has 2 sections. Behind a door in one section, you'll find the ironing board, the iron, and a fuse pack, plus two small, narrow shelves, one too high for me to reach; the other, larger section of the wardrobe DOES NOT OPEN at all, clearly containing some equipment needed for the room. In open view as part of the wardrobe unit, is a small built-in luggage rack with maybe a 10-inch hanging rack jutting out from the wall, and above that, again quite high up, is a narrow metal rack. With only one shallow drawer, and two narrow shelves behind the wardrobe door, the bulk of your clothing and personal effects are in open view all the time. One night table has a small open storage area. The other is just a table top, with no drawer. So personal items are in view on the table tops, making a room designed to be sleek and modern look cluttered. BOTTOM LINE: I mention all these details to be helpful if you are two people, on a longer trip, seeking a multi-night stay here at the Curio Collection by Hilton. We were in-country for 10 days. We each had a small wheeled bag and a backpack. We stayed here 3 days, enjoyed ourselves in this great location between Darling Harbor, with its waterside cafes plus the aquarium and the wildlife center on one side, and the best of the central business district on the other. But with so little space to stash our stuff, we were ready to move on to somewhere more spacious, and more accommodating in terms of drawers, shelves, and closets. We would gladly stay here again for a night or two, with just backpacks or overnight bags. In the right circumstances, this is a wonderful place.","April 21, 2019","20    West Hotel Sydney, Curio Collection by Hilton

Our room was an internal room, no window to outside our view was of the restaurant, therefore I felt I couldn’t open the curtains and felt a little claustrophobic and dark.I recommend this hotel, the location is good close to Darling Harbour and Wynyard Station. I would stay again just in a higher level room with a window. ","April 14, 2019","20    West Hotel Sydney, Curio Collection by Hilton

There is a very small area to hang up clothes and if you have dresses it’s really not possible to hang them up. For business travellers - there is really no dedicated work space.

We got to the hotel earlier than I anticipated 7.30am so I certainly did not think a room would be ready. They did not have a room ready but they did have a vacant room which they got ready for us and stored our bags (and our friends bags who were spending a couple more hours in sydney before they flew home) so we went out for coffee and the room was ready about 9. We had room on third floor - not big but certainly interesting - bed good - bathroom good - toileteries good - breakfast good.

1122,"We arrived morning of Feb 3rd from a very long flight from the United States. We were greeted nicely and offered an upgrade to a higher floor...3rd level. This does not mean a room that is larger or nicer but a higher level. We faced the street and overall it was fine. I consider this a boutique hotel which is smaller and more intimate. No lobby or executive level. Everyone was always kind and professional. The rooms seem to be the source of contention for most...there is hardly room to put your bags as we had 2 huge ones...no closet. We managed however it was tight. Otherwise rooms ok, bed nice and bathroom small but amenities were good. Water & snacks offered daily. The location is great to get around Sydney prior to our cruise. We enjoyed time on the Harbour boats and the hop on hop off buses. It's a beautiful area and so much to explore in this magnificent city! Breakfast was nice with hot & cold selections every morning...also fresh juice. Modern and clean. We are Diamond level and received the buffet daily. We were never offered drink vouchers, disappointing as many others commented they received them. We enjoyed the restaurant in the hotel. Food was very good as was presentation and service.

The staff were so kind and helpful. I have no hesitation in highly recommending this hotel. The location was perfect for our needs and the nearby shops at Haymarket were a bonus.

The staff on Adina's 24 hour reception desk were friendly and knowledgeable. The Adina Central is in an old post office building. It's three minutes walk from Central Station and close to food stores and great local restaurants and bars. If you come in by train the location is unbeatable and (regardless of your means of travel) provides a great base to stay in and explore Sydney. The soundproofing is excellent and you can train, bus, Uber or taxi to many locations. You can also walk the old Goods Line from Central to the Powerhouse Museum and Darling Harbour. The bathroom is a little crowded. The bathtub, with its overhead shower, is tricky to get into. Rather than a bath/shower it would have been more accessible as a standalone shower.

The room itself was lovely and quite enjoyable while we were there with good wifi access and speeds. We loved the neighborhood it was in as well. Not necessarily a downside, but it is a bit detached from downtown, with a maybe 20-30 minute walk to Circular Quay and a 5-10 walk to nearest train station to head that way. Good base for exploring Sydney and views are amazing.

There are a number of street cafe's close by to get a good breakfast or lunch, and a good Woolworth's metro supermarket across the road if you are self catering.The staff are great, polite and very helpful. We were able to walk from the hotel, across to the cathedral and park, and then on to the City Centre. This gives you a different view of Sydney. A good start to our holiday.

1304,"My wife and I recently travelled to Sydney to take a 12 Night cruise to New Zealand and chose to stay at the Macleay Hotel 2 nights both pre and post cruise. This hotel was competitively priced, clean and great location for our needs. Front Desk staff were excellent and very helpful.We really appreciated being able to check into our room early and our post cruise room on the sixth floor had a lovely view. There is a kitchenette with complementary coffee and tea. Across the street from the hotel is a super market that also sells beer and wine. There are a few restaurants and bars in the area.The washroom was modern, had a nice shower and toiletries. Beds were comfortable and complementary WiFi worked reasonably well. There is also an outdoor pool and BBQ area.We love to walk and from the hotel we walked to the Royal Botanical Gardens (a must see), Opera House, Overseas Cruise Terminal and the ""Rocks"". You may want to consider purchasing an Opal public transit card and use it to ride unlimited times on the trains, buses and ferry's. We took a ferry to Manly Beach which was lovely. Daily cost with an Opal card is $15.80 maximum and $2.70 on Sunday's. You can re-load the card. The only exception is the trip to the airport. One Way fare from the airport is $18.70 (Adult Fare).We decided on taking public transit (train) to and from the Airport. This decision was made after reviewing the high cost for taxi's and poor on-line reviews for the airport shuttle services. The location of the hotel made travel by train easy. Take the T8 from the Sydney Airport to Central Station and transfer to the T4 to Kings Cross. The hotel is located about a 10 minute walk from Kings Cross. We should have taken the train to the Overseas Cruise Terminal (get off at Circular Quay Station) to board our cruise ship Instead we waived down a taxi (13 Cabs) across the street from our Hotel. I figured the cost would not be expensive as we only had a short trip of about 4 km. In our opinion the cab driver took us a much longer route through heavy traffic. We didn't know that the taxi meter runs on time instead of distance.Our cab driver was unsympathetic and while sitting still in traffic watching the meter keep going up I finally said enough when the meter reached $25. I paid the driver and we walked the remaining short distance to the ship.He never even got out of his cab to help us with our luggage merely popped open the trunk. The Train fare would have been $2.20 each.We did take the train to our hotel on return from our cruise. I now have a better understanding why people are turning to Uber. I might add that this taxi driver is not representative of the lovely helpful Australian people we encountered during our trip. Sydney is a beautiful city with an abundance of things to do and see. The Macleay Hotel was situated suitable for our needs at a competitive price, clean with an excellent staff. I would recommend this hotel.","March 6, 2019","24    Macleay Hotel

1309,"I stayed here with my husband for 5 nights in Dec 2018. We arrived at approx. 10pm after 25+ hours travelling from the UK. The check-in was thankfully very quick. We popped over to Woolworths (grocery store) over the road straight away to get a snack and water. The hotel is located in a very good location, 15 minute walk to the Sydney harbour and at the bottom of a busy road of restaurants, cafes and bars. Being at the bottom of the road it was nice and quiet. We found the bed and pillows comfy, bathroom a good size with really good shower. Daily newspaper delivered although we hadn't requested it. The kitchen area was a bit shabby but we didn't use it. Wifi was pretty good for the first 4 nights of our stay and then we received a letter under the door to say they'd changed the wifi to a faster service so it should be improved. It did the opposite and we had a lot of trouble trying to get online on the last day.Pool area was nice, only 4 or so loungers but never full up. You can see the harbour view from it. There were BBQ facilities but we didn't use. We also didn't access the roof to check out the view which I wish we had done, you need to get a key card from reception to be able to do this I believe.Mini bar expensive in the room but with the shop opposite the hotel no need to use it. We didn't book a harbour view room so we had the view of the next door building, it provides zero privacy if you have your blinds up! The blinds were not black out so pretty light in the room early in the morning.All in all it was a good hotel. I think it was good value for money for central Sydney so expect it to be pretty basic and you'll be fine! I would probably stay here again if I visited and my budget was similar. Tip for Sydney - all day travel on a Sunday with an Opal card is max $2.70 so plan as much of your travelling around on this day if you can!","January 14, 2019","24    Macleay Hotel

1310,"Our family wanted to see the famous Sydney harbor fireworks, and we were convinced after few research that Macleay Hotel was the best. It cost $1000/night with min 4 nights. ..and the service is horrible. Hotel is old, I could smell mold in some areas, view from the room is spectacular, and roof top for fireworks is fantastic. But thats about it. Other than the young chinese looking guy at the reception, the other guys at the reception is downright rude. We had to complain and got bit agitated after our room were not cleaned for 2 days. We told them in the morning that we would be out until 1 pm, please clean the room...after 2 days of complain, on the third day they were cleaned on time. If I summarise the amount of money spent on the hotel, we could have spent it on a very nice restaurant by the harbor for NYE. Macleay did have spectacular view of the harbor, about 40 or so people were up on the roof...and they provided ..a bottle of wine..and a bottle of champagne ..pathetic.. not coming back there ever again.","January 5, 2019","24    Macleay Hotel

1311,"We paid $1000 AUD per night, minimum 4 nights, for this hotel because of the reported fireworks view. That's for a hotel that typically goes for $200 or so AUD per night. You'd think for that price, they'd really do it up for New Year's Eve. No. For the 9PM fireworks, they had champagne (until it ran out) or soda, glow sticks and sparklers. Same for the midnight fireworks. The roof is not handicapped accessible. And, they would not allow tripods for cameras. We had to have a letter authorizing us to be on the roof, and had to go to the desk to get that. Not a big deal, but for so much money, why not put the letter along with some 2019 glasses, hats, maybe noise makers, on each bed? Thousands paid for a place to stand and watch 30 minutes of fireworks. While the view was excellent, a two night minimum at that price would have been reasonable. We could have done a luxury hotel and boat in the harbour for the same or less money. Then there was the service. One of the desk clerks was flat out rude. Another couldn't answer a question about where to get coffee. Our friends were two days without toilet paper in their room, though they repeatedly asked. We asked for additional towels that never came. No coffee maker, just instant packets. No room service other than what you could get yourself for 1/2 the price for breakfast across the street (yes, that's where they get their room service food.) And, after all that, we had taken 2 waters from the fridge before seeing the listing that said they were $5 each, and they billed us for those. And, lastly, considering they're catering to so many foreign clients, their bill does not state whether the prices are in AUD. I would not go back. This is a budget hotel charging luxury hotel pricing for NYE. It's obvious they know they'll fill the hotel without repeat business, putting customer service as a low priority.","January 3, 2019","24    Macleay Hotel

Shower controls a bit touchy to get the right water temperature, but fine. Bed small for us. We are accustomed to king bed, but did us well. Bed comfortable tho. Two chairs for small eating table. Desk with no chair. They had a DVD player to borrow along with some copies of DVD's to borrow in addition to original DVD's. A grocery store across the street. We were able to get an Opal (public transportation card) in the grocery store. There is also a bank next door. Front desk helpful, especially the gentleman that checked us in. There is no concierge as such, but front desk able to give info on things to do, places to go, how to get there, etc. Can be a bit of a walk (about 10 minutes) to Kings (train) station. Not really that long of a walk, but when you have foot problems anyway and know it will be a long day on your feet, it does seem like a long walk. Large activity brochure selection in business center. Two computers in business area just next to front door. We had a wonderful view of Circular Quay from room 703.

1335," I was unable to stay in a hotel that had such unhygienic issues.I found a a lot of long hairs, when me and my partner have short hair, as well as pubic hairs! There was also food crumbs and stains all over the dresser, and table in the room. The pillow also had what looked like eaither vomit or food on it.The GM also came to the room and said to my face it's just one hair, as she was shaking the hairs off the blanket and sheets. I asked her to stop trying to get rid of the evidence because I already had taken photos of it all.As for the pillow she said it was wool. There is no wool in the bedding or room. She then tried to wipe that off too, which wouldn't go away because it was on the pillow pretty good. She then tried to scratch it off with her nails.I was offended that the GM would even try to prove me wrong with such clear evidence. I was offended that she tried to get rid of evidence while talking to me. She said that her reviews online were nothing but positive and that I must be wrong. I explained that's why I chose to stay at Macleay Hotel. I wont forget the angry eyes of the GM and condescending voice.SHAME on you Macleay! Book else where, it's more convenient else where, cheaper, and cleaner!This was the worst mistake ever to book this hotel, especially after an 11hr flight. I thought asking for a refund for a room that I had not slept at was not asking much. Instead of getting a full refund like promised, the decided to give me some. I was only there for 10 mins..... sad that cover up artists like this are in business.","August 23, 2018","24    Macleay Hotel

The hotel has no restaurant but as they said there are plenty of local places to get breakfast. Plus with a fridge and kitchen facilities you could get a few odds and ends to keep in the room.

1343,Our expectations were far exceeded. We phoned to ask at 10am if we could drop our bags early as we were on an early flight. Instead of luggage storage we were told we had been upgraded to a harbour view room (beautiful view!) and our room was ready now! Everything was clean and exactly what we needed. Housekeeping spoke to us every morning to see if we would like clean towels or milk etc the ladies were very efficient and had great customer service. All the men on front desk (we met 4 over the weekwnd) were helpful with maps and train timetables etc as it was our first time in Sydney. We really enjoyed our stay and would thoroughly recommend. It was a short walk to the opera house and we used trains just a couple of blocks up at kings cross to get to circular quay and the ferries and also our to Bondi and Coogee beach. They also stores our bags for the day on our departing day so we could continue sightseeing despite checking out. Thanks so much see you next time!,"June 19, 2018","24    Macleay Hotel

The location is excellent in the heart of everything or close the door and get a decent nights sleep.Staff are usually long term at this property and you will see the same faces time and time again which is important in maintaining good standards at an accommodation property.The room rates for that sort of view elsewhere are often double, however are located in very different neighbourhoods.","June 15, 2018","24    Macleay Hotel

1347,"We stayed in a Harbour View room & mentioned at the time of booking that we were coming across to Sydney hoping to see something of the Vivid festival from our room, but - even though we were on the 7th floor - we could not see the Bridge or Opera House (or anything of Vivid for that matter), so quite disappointing in that respect. In fact, we looked out onto a neighbouring building. Perhaps the views are only available from the 2 higher floors and being allocated a room on one of these floors is something of a lottery. That aside, the hotel was fine, albeit with rooms on the small side.","June 5, 2018","24    Macleay Hotel

They were advertised as small, so we expected that when we arrived, but it was nice to see the amount of attention to detail that went into the rooms. You could see how much thought they had put into the rooms in an effort to make use of as much of the room as possible, despite the size (things like making the bed higher so that it can fit suitcases underneath - I've never seen this anywhere, it's such a good idea!). The availability of room service was great too, with a full Deliveroo menu in the room with a selection from a range of close by restaurants.

1369,"I enjoyed my three night stay at the Veriu Central.Pros:Great location near Central Station, lots of restaurants in the area. Within walking distance to Darling Harbour, Sydney Westfield and multi-plex cinema.Cosy, inviting, pleasant lobby that doubles as the bar.Happy hour every night (or maybe just weeknights?) in the lobby bar from 5-7, with select $5 beer and wine.Friendly, helpful staff - both at the front desk and the bar.Complimentary self-serve water in the lobby - both still and sparkling. This is a real deal breaker for me - to have either water available in the lobby, or complimentary bottled water in the room.Modern decor in the rooms and bathrooms - they look recently renovated, with a lovely blue and grey colour scheme.Plenty of power points in the room, including by the bed side table.Chinese restaurant attached to the hotel had a fun decor, delicious dumplings and great service.Basic breakfast available for purchase in the lobby - coffee, pastries, muffins, etc.There was a fridge in the room.Cons:As other reviewers have mentioned - these rooms are tiny! I upgraded to the next room up - and it was still tiny! The tinyness is a bit of a theme - with a tiny bathroom, tiny hallways, tiny elevator...There is only one elevator - so sometimes a few minutes wait.There is no counter space at all in the bathroom - and very little anywhere in the room. There wasn't even enough counter space to leave my toothbrush and toothpaste in the bathroom! There is very little hanging space for clothes - and no suitcase stand.The TV is to the side of the bed, instead of at the foot of the bed - awkward to watch.There was no bedside lamp or light switch next to the bed - so if you're reading in bed, you have to get up and go turn off the light. From the actual rooms, I would have probably given this hotel 3*, but the pleasant lobby bar and the complimentary water in the lobby, plus the friendly staff, have elevated it to 4* for me.They can't change the size of the rooms, but I would suggest that it would be fairly simple to add bedside lamps and a suitcase stand. A bit of counter space in the bathroom would also be nice.The Veriu tends to be one of the more reasonably priced 4* hotels in the CBD.

1383,"One thing I must say, the staff are lovely, friendly and helpful. Hotel room however was VERY small and has next to no storage for clothes and shoes, enough room for suitcases under the bed though. The hotel is probably one of the cheapest in such a good location, therefore you get what you pay for. The bed is tiny without a proper duvet sheet, therefore found that we were sleeping with only the bare duvet and mattress by the end of the night. The room was air conditioned, with a fridge and coffee making facilities, restocked everyday, which was great. WiFi connection is poor and had to use my mobile data most of the time at the hotel. The hotel advertises that it offers Netflix but this does not work as the internet connection is not strong enough. We even had a maintenance guy in our room to connect us to the right network and it still didn’t work after that. I know you don’t go on holiday to watch Netflix but if you have had a full on day exploring, it’s nice to chill and use if the hotel offers it. The shower was good and powerful, but again bathroom was small and there was mould on the sealing above the shower. Complementary wash products were available too. Overall great stay in Sydney and the hotel served its purpose and great location with friendly staff. Just wish room was bigger, proper sheets on the bed and wish the WiFi was better for phones and Netflix. ","April 20, 2019","25    Veriu Central

The marble bathroom was lovely, with a great rainfall shower and fragrant Molton Brown toiletries. There was absolutely no street noise, which allowed for a good night's sleep.

1407,"Little Albion is a rarity in Sydney, so different from the big, impersonal hotels. First big plus is that it's so close to Central station, in the swanky suburb of Surry Hills that is known for its cafes and restaurants (and also a colorful past, as the artwork in this hotel will tell you). Secondly, the warm and helpful staff that will make you settle in quite easily. And third, of course, is the design of this hotel, which has that minimalist chic feel.The room does a great job in making me feel ""ensconced"" - the size is not that large, but beautifully designed and furnished. It has an open plan, though, so it's more suited to couples rather than workmates. I particularly loved the bath and the Molton Brown amenities. A simple breakfast is served on the ground floor, where there's also the self-serve ""minibar"" with premium snacks and drinks. Tried the excellent pre-mixed cocktail (""imported"" from The Everleigh, no less). There's no restaurant in this hotel, but the staff will help you to order food from nearby eateries if you want to dine in. However, it's also worth exploring the area yourself as Surry Hills is home to some of Sydney's best food experiences.","May 25, 2019","26    Little Albion, a Crystalbrook Collection Bouti...

The Little Albion is the opposite -- the cheerful and genuinely helpful concierge/front desk staff welcomed me by showing me the honesty bar and how the hotel works -- and then brought up a bottle of fresh milk to the room for tea and coffee. It really reminded me of the Firmdale hotels in London which are so welcoming and hospitable. Being able to fix youself a drink and a snack at the end of the day in a comfortable lounge just takes the edge off the big-city business travel marathon. I had an entry-level room and it was delightful. Restrained furnishings and just enough colour to make it welcoming. The top-end toiletries, tea, coffee and cookies are a lovely touch. Location is strolling distance from the CBD and there are plenty of good cafes close by. I had an excellent Japanese meal at Gogyo, a block away, which styles itself as Hakata ramen, but has delicious Japanese side dishes as well.","March 23, 2019","26    Little Albion, a Crystalbrook Collection Bouti...

We were kindly upgraded upon check in which was very nice & I was very grateful as I believe the original room I booked (crashpad) would have been too small and I had considered upgrading myself anyway. The staff were all very friendly and had a great laid back, unpretentious attitude, much more welcoming I think. The bed was also super comfy! Wish I had taken down the details of the mattress and pillows. slept like a baby! We also loved the option of having Uber eats delivered, as the hotel didn’t have an i house kitchen I believe. We did this one night and ate on the rooftop, was lovely! Also a great location very close to lots of places to eat / drink and very near to central station, a massive plus.

1415,"This boutique hotel really is one of Sydney’s hidden gems. Staying here felt like I was in a Wes Anderson film. Lovely front of house staff, charming decor and comfortable and well appointed rooms. A lot of effort has been put in to this hotel and it shows. Thanks for a memorable stay !

1416,We stayed 4 nights at this wonderful small boutique hotel. It was MARVELLOUS. From the time we entered the lobby till the time we checked out it was gracious and welcoming. The room was wonderful. Bed was super comfortable (we took a photo of the brand to buy one at home!) and spotlessly clean. Breakfast and facilities were outstanding also. Couldn’t recommend highly enough.,"January 19, 2019","26    Little Albion, a Crystalbrook Collection Bouti...

1418,"Tucked away in a little side road this 'guest house' is perfect! It certainly ticks all the boxes: friendly, helpful staff, great albeit simple breakfasts, convenient location etc. Full of lovely touches - a 24 hour coffee and tea station, a honesty bar, fresh fruit, roof terrace, bottled water in the fridge, quality toiletries. Rooms are quite small but perfectly formed!","November 19, 2018","26    Little Albion, a Crystalbrook Collection Bouti...

1419,"I’m not into big commercial hotels, I only like beautiful boutique hotels and the Little Albion was perfect. The staff were overly helpful and gave 100% at all times. The hotel interior and rooms are beautiful, the little Molton Brown toiletries and small (but very sufficient) added breakfast gave it that extra touch (muesli, toast, spreads, croissants and fruit). Be sure to sit on the rooftop at some stage during your stay it’s very relaxing. Highly recommend!","November 9, 2018","26    Little Albion, a Crystalbrook Collection Bouti...

1420,"We choose the biggest room as we were there for a week. It was lovely! Spotless, staff fabulous, accommodating, respectful and on it! Room has all the upscale details we love from massive soaking tub to killer party shower. Area is fabulous too - great walking to fabulous restaurants like Nomad, Billy's, Reuben Coffee House (the hotel has free breakfast, but we did discover the grilled poached pears on rye with ricotta at Reuben and that kind of took over). Easy uber to anywhere. Easy walk to downtown shopping, fun shops on Crowne. We had never been to Sydney before so glad we stumbled upon this gem on TripAdvisor. Not one negative thing to say. Gold star. And we're fussy! (There is an honor bar in the lobby - no mini bar in room but was a fridge, no loss.)","November 4, 2018","26    Little Albion, a Crystalbrook Collection Bouti...

1421,This boutique hotel is a good find in the heart of surrey hills. With a beautiful feel and an edgy design. It’s the baby brother of the QT. It’s also dog friendly which was a good plus to us.

1422,"Such an amazing hidden Gem! I love finding little boutique hotels to stay at when traveliing for work. This place ticked all my boxes. Location - amazing, walking distance to great food, coffee, wine or even clubsService - The reason i love boutique places is that i feel the service is always so much more personal, i got to know a few of the staff during my stay and they all consistently impressedStyle - Gorgeous rooms, cosy but perfectly fine, styling was beautiful and you can tell someone has put a lit of effort into the overall look and feel. The finishes are amazing and a very high quality.Facilities - All inclusive for a business trip, reception lounge area was great for relaxing and the rooftop and cafe area are great.Overall it would have to be one of the best experiences I have had on a business trip in Sydney and will 100% be staying again.

1425,"Now its very rare that i use names in my reviews as i generally don't get introduced to who i'm dealing with in most hotels that is unless i can read the small name badges usually adorning staff.Let me introduce you to Wendy and her team.The Albion brings back proper old world respectful service instead of the starchy performances given by more upmarket and exclusive hotels of Sydney. We were genuinely greeted like old friends and felt at home straight away.The Little Albion has all you want as a couple and goes the extra level if your looking for a romantic break in the middle of Sydney but want to feel special as if you were the only people there.The room was amazing, modern, warm, and romantic.Ivan greeted us at the door and checked us in. Now this was one of those rare moments that rise this establishment head over heels above all other hotels. A staff member that truly provides that personal touch to make you feel special and welcomed without the scripted bland greeting you get elsewhere.That's not saying that the other staff were not upto Ivans level. I apologise for not getting the other staff member names and throwing in a mention here but the lady at check in and the gentleman at breakfast were excellent.Well done one and all and keep up the good work and you will be number one on my list for a CDB booking from now on. I have a funny feeling though as you get your name out there more and more it will be difficult to find a spare room.Lastly the price. Well all you lovely folk who love to splash your hard earned money on the upmarket hotels nearby go right ahead, but i'm liking been treated like a king without the price-tag so i will be back.","September 4, 2018","26    Little Albion, a Crystalbrook Collection Bouti...

Truly wonderful comfort in the linen, towels, amazing breakfast offering unique quality tastes and such a warm welcoming from Wendy. We enjoyed the rooftop that overlooks the roof tops of Surry Hills, a walk to dinner were fine food is easy to find and a relax in the communal areas where glass surrounds and the sun shines in. A true relax was had in our king bed with a swivel tv and well thought out lighting. Really excellent, we will be back.","July 29, 2018","26    Little Albion, a Crystalbrook Collection Bouti...

1429,"Gorgeous design and what I loved most were the little touches of luxury like the extra large and lush bath mat, molton brown toilettries, rustic mugs for tea and coffee and the artwork around the building - love the individually designed curtains and upholstery and really comfortable bed. Breakfast was a cute offering and felt like a home away from home - guest house means what it says with Wendy as the host - you feel like a long lost friend insider her home, but the best thing here is you have someone to clean up after you :) Great team and nothing was too difficult - Thanks for a wonderful stay and hope to come again soon - would for sure recommend to people wanting an authentic local Sydney experience without the tourists all around...amazing local restaurants nearby and it feels like a very cultured neighbourhood!","July 25, 2018","26    Little Albion, a Crystalbrook Collection Bouti...

1430,"Little Albion Guesthouse was the perfect place for our Sydney getaway. Tucked away from what is the hustle and bustle of Surry Hills yet so close to everything. (Crown Street and Central Station less than a 5 min walk) Driving we assumed parking would be a nightmare and very costly, however, Little Albion offers discounted overnight parking at the Rydges which is close by. We found amble on street ticketed parking for the night for around $12.From the moment we arrived we felt at home. The entire guesthouse was beautifully designed, and the hosts very attentive.Our stay began with a lovely cup of tea in the sunken lounge and once we were ready we were shown to our room (206). Along the way our host explained the Honour Bar, Rooftop and Lite breakfast offering - more on this later. Upon entering our room we were asked for our milk preference options were Full Cream, Lite, Soy or Almond which was promptly brought to our room. This was just one of the small touches that made the stay. We also loved the Molton Brown amenities, luxurious robes and wonderful large pillows.Before heading out for dinner we enjoyed a few drinks in the well stocked and reasonably priced Honour Bar - the cocktail station was a great addition! While we already had plans for breakfast and didn't get a chance to enjoy the Lite Breakfast it looked incredible, especially the housemade muesli and selection of breads we will certainly try on our next visit.Thank you to all the hosts at Little Albion for making our stay a memorable one, we cannot wait to visit again.","July 11, 2018","26    Little Albion, a Crystalbrook Collection Bouti...

1432,"We stayed at Little Albion and had such a great stay. It's hidden on Little Albion Street and then you enter an amazing building with lots of history and the interiors are very modern and new. Service is so friendly and personal, they even bring your choice of milk to your room! Seeing as I drink soy, that was a good touch that you don't get at most hotels. The room was spacious enough to relax in, beds very comfortable and great shower. Honour bar with an honesty system, good idea and felt at home having a drink before going out for dinner. Definitely a place I will recommend to anyone for a quiet luxurious getaway so near the city and hidden in the midst of where locals like to hang out.","July 4, 2018","26    Little Albion, a Crystalbrook Collection Bouti...

1433,Had the pleasure of staying at this boutique hotel last night. Situated in the centre of the restaurant area of Surry Hills.... we went to a function down the street and decided to stay the evening as we would have a few drinks. Was extremely surprised that the property was new and very quant. The beds were so comfy with my favourite big pillows. The breakfast was super good ... loved the homemade muesli and the beautiful array of artisan breads and coffee. Being central to the city and the sporting area ... found it a convenient location. The staff were amazingly friendly and so accommodating.... would stay again.

No on site parking, which was difficult when we had so many bags, but was cheaper overnight parking available via the hotel in a secure undercover car park which we where great full for as there was a terrible hailstone storm the evening we where in Sydney!  Also no lift and lugging our bags up 3 flights was super hard! But that was my own fault for not checking!The rooms however where super spacious and comfortable; despite a leak in our room the hotel where super accommodating and moved us promptly to another room!

It only had a tiny shelf to put things on and if you needed to get rid of toothpaste in your mouth you had to be careful when lifting your head not to knock your head.There is no wardrobe available, so I was ended up not unpacking anything for 3 days I was there.I returned to my room on the Saturday night (about 10pm after a full day at work from 7.00am when I left the room) to find that the housekeeping staff hadn't bothered to replenish coffee supplies so I had one sachet of coffee for the next day, and if I hadn't left a note I'm certain there would have been none when I returned the next night. Unfortunately there is more than 2 times the amount of tea to coffee (max 3 sachets). I could not ring down to request more as the office is closed and there is no way of contacting anyone (unless you want to go downstairs in your night clothes to find the contact number at the booking desk area (which I was not prepared to do at now 11pm).I feel that they should have a register in each room of where guests can call someone at night, also that there should be staff to assist guests with their luggage.","November 18, 2018","27    The Maisonette

There is everything you need in the neighborhood including supermarkets, banks, restaurants etc. The hotel is located on a very nice tree lined street and on the quiet side vs being directly on Darlinghurst Avenue. The hotel has no elevator. I was traveling solo but still booked a triple room because it was the same price as a double. It would have been tight for 3 people. All the beds were twin and very comfortable. Furnishings were fine and very pleasant. Bath was average and a bit small. Staff was very nice and since my international flight arrived early in the morning, they arranged to have my room cleaned up earlier than 1400 which was very much appreciated!

1456,So my favorite color is blue...and the decoration with color and objects here exactly answer my taste. Though the drawbacks are a 10 minute-walk from station and no elevator. Other things are awesome..It's not far from both airport and the city center.You got plenty of supermarkets and places to eat. The street is alive both day and night...so it's really safe. A king room is very cozy and I was happy even listening to music in my room. The place is kinda good mixture of old fashioned style with modern taste.,"August 19, 2018","27    The Maisonette

I did not like that since I do not know how long that blanked was on that shelf. I believe it's much better to leave clean towels on a clean bed sheetsHowever, if you are looking for a cheap room just to sleep in, it's just ok. The location is very good.

1461,"I stayed at The Maisonette for almost a week. The staff was friendly and for the most part, very helpful. They require that you pay for the entire stay upon check in....I won't do that again until I make sure that the room was acceptable. I had reserved a ""Magnolia Room"" which is more expensive but is advertised to have an updated bathroom. Upon check in I was given a room with a bath that clearly had not been updated, had only a shower curtain, and pipes that leaked when the water was turned on in the sink. I went down to the reception area and the lady very politely told me that the room was indeed a ""Magnolia Room"". She said that since I had requested a ""quiet room"" that they gave me this room. I showed her my confirmation for the ""Magnolia Room"", pictures on their website, and my correspondence with the hotel prior to my arrival. She said that they could move us to a different room, but we would have to pay extra for housekeeping to move the twin beds back in to a king configuration in the old room. Mind you, we had only been in the room all of about ten minutes maximum when I went down to talk to her. I advised her that that was completely unacceptable and that we wanted the room type that I had reserved. She finally said that she would look in to it and let us know later. My friend and I went sightseeing and later received an email that they would let us move and did not charge us for extra housekeeping. The new room was much larger, did have the updated bathroom, and looked out upon Challis Avenue.The room and bathroom seemed to be very clean. However, towards the end of our stay, we started noticing roaches in the bathroom. Since reception is open only certain hours and we left very early in the morning for a day trip to the Blue Mountains, I emailed the hotel and told them about the roaches. They responded once they opened up reception, apologized, and left some roach spray. We got back to the hotel that evening (again, after reception closed) and sprayed the roach spray. The next morning, I once again saw a couple of roaches in the bathroom (apparently they were coming out from under the door frame). The location is pretty good (about a 10 minute walk to King's Cross Station and close to a Woolworth's grocery store and restaurants) and the price was good. The wifi worked well in our second room. It was nice having a small refrigerator for drinks. But, after the experience that we had, I would not stay at this hotel again if I ever go back to Sydney.","May 14, 2018","27    The Maisonette

1473,"This is a TINY boutique hotel in downtown Sydney, very close to many major attractions. It is VERY tiny. It is squeezed in between a couple of restaurants on a seemingly quiet street, and if you're not careful, you'll miss the front door. The lobby is so small, there is room for one chair. The front desk is not staffed 24/7, which could be an issue for some. We had a room that had 2 twin beds, which is what I requested, as I was traveling with my son. There was no closet in the room, only a very small open shelving unit with a hanging bar. The bathroom was so small. No counter space, just a sink attached to the wall. There was no tub or even a shower stall. Just a shower head on one side of the bathroom with a drain in the floor, and a shower curtain separating the shower from the toilet. Needless to say, the ENTIRE bathroom got wet when you showered! The room had one towel per person, and when I asked for an additional towel, I was told there would be a charge for that! There was no tissue paper (Kleenex), only toilet paper. The TV was hung high on the wall, at an awkward angle. There were 2 windows, but no view--looked out on another building a few feet away. There was a fair amount of noise early in the morning from the restaurant next door as well. Lastly, no elevator. We were on the second floor, so had to lug our stuff up 2 flights of narrow marble stairs. This is probably not a great place for families--too small and nothing to keep kids occupied. There is no food service at this hotel, but we did have pizza delivered on night! The location, however, is great. It is within walking distance of the Opera House and Botanic Gardens, and the Harbor. Burt far enough away from the noise & traffic to make you feel as though you are away from it all a bit.","January 13, 2018","27    The Maisonette

1494,"This is a 4-star hotel and is understandably not luxurious. It does, however, provide the basic things travelers need. A simple breakfast (consisting of bread, cereal, yoghurt, coffee and juice) is provided for each day, and bathroom supplies are replenished whenever necessary. As mentioned, it’s nothing fancy, but the location is quite good. The area, which is across a big park, is pleasant. It’s also easy to get to restaurants and places of interest from here, and there are convenience stores nearby. During our stay, the persons at the front desk were helpful, giving us tips we needed and even leaving the front desk once to hail a cab for us.One thing that turned us off during our stay here was the housekeeping service. The day after we checked in, we were quite tired so we stayed in during the morning. A little before 1pm, I got a call from a lady who apparently was the person assigned to service our room. She told me that she was done cleaning the other rooms on our floor, and that our room was the last room that needed to be serviced. I asked her if she could come in 10 or 20 minutes as we would already be out by that time. She told me in a very rude, demanding tone that she needed to clean our room already and that if we didn’t allow her to clean it then, she would leave and would no longer come back. I asked if it would be okay if they work in the room while we were there and she said that that would be fine. She came in with a younger lady who she appeared to be training. The older lady entered our room without saying a word to any of us, and proceeded to give orders in a very brash manner to the trainee about how to fix the beds. She then went to the sink to wash the few dishes that were in it. She did this with a lot of noise, as though she was slamming the plates and utensils. When she was done, she went to the landline to call someone who presumably was another member of the housekeeping staff. She spoke to the other person in a very loud and irritated tone, not at all mindful that there were guests in the room. After that, she went back to the trainee to tell her what to do in the bathroom. She was obviously quite annoyed with the younger lady and even verbally insulted her (saying things like “You don’t use your brain!”) in our presence. When they were done, she just exited the room while murmuring something and without saying anything to any of us. It was the younger lady who greeted me when they entered, and it was she who also said a meek but very polite goodbye as they were leaving.I realize that this isn’t a 5-star hotel, and we adjusted our expectations while we were there. However, I don’t think it’s unreasonable to expect basic courtesy from members of the staff of any establishment providing accommodations to paying guests. I understand that the staff needs to stick to a schedule which is precisely why I allowed them to service the room while we were there, and why we all kept quiet and tried to stay out of their way so they could easily finish what needed to be done. However, the way this lady spoke to me was impertinent and offensive. To the trainee, her remarks were disparaging and hurtful. Even if the scope of the daily housekeeping services of this hotel is limited to fixing the beds, changing the towels, and collecting the trash (other chores beyond that, they no longer do), I still think that a respectful attitude toward guests and toward their fellow staff members is something that should be expected of every employee of the hotel.","June 15, 2019","28    Hyde Park Inn

The hotel was comfortable with adequate facilities and facing Hyde Park, but it was expensive for what it offered and certainly not impressive. Breakfast was very basic and the view of the park is its only selling point. More suited to business users.","May 22, 2019","28    Hyde Park Inn

1498,"The hotel is located in the Central district of Sydney, right in front of the Hyde park. The train station is 2 min walk, the train itself will take you to the airport in 15 min, the fastest I've ever experienced. It's 15 min walk to the Darling Harbour and a nice 20-30 min walk to the Circular quay with the world famous harbour and the one and only Sydney Opera House. 5 min walk to the Australian museum (right across the park) and 10 min to Botanic gardens. All the walks take you through either broad busy streets with many shops or the park, so they are quite pleasant. Also, 5 min walk to the World Square with its shops and pick-up place for many day-trips (if that's your thing). A bus to the Bondi beach stops right across from the hotel.The hotel is quite old, you can feel it both in the lobby and in the room, but it was ok, more like historic heritage. The room was huge. It was actually meant for 3 people (1 double bed and 1 single bed), but for a single use it was more than enough. It also had a relax corner (sofa, two armchairs, small table) and kitchenette corner (sink, fridge, dishes, microwave, kitchen table with chairs). Even though a hotel is situated on a very busy street, the noise wasn't a problem.This hotel doesn't offer traditional breakfast, but they put in a fridge a light breakfast every day - orange juice, milk, crisps, bread with spread. You can always buy something in the nearest Coles supermarket or pick one of many restaurants and cafes. The bathroom was ok. The staff had some newcomers, who were still learning, but overall no problems. They even had a newspaper delivered each morning. Not that I knew much about Australian news, but still it was nice. Overall nice experience, very good location and amazing, incredible and breathtaking Sydney.","May 5, 2019","28    Hyde Park Inn

It is very centrally located and an easy 2 minute walk to the train station to get to Circular Quay. a tip for people flying into Sydney airport, don't get a taxi as we were ripped of to the tune of $80 to get from the airport into the city, we should have got the train for half the price","April 19, 2019","28    Hyde Park Inn

Nice to not be captive in a room. We were over looking the Memorial so it was also captivating at night. Convenient to city, train station and other facilities. I called in advance as we traveled in early and needed to store luggage. This was no problem to them but when we arrived our room was already available. Upon check out we stored our luggage prior to our boarding time. They happily called us a cab and assisted with our luggage. Friendly, clean, continental breakfast included which was sufficient. Toast, cereal, juice and fruit. Can’t ask for much more. Definitely on the go to list. ","April 3, 2019","28    Hyde Park Inn

1505,"Booked into a deluxe studio for a 3 day weekend after getting of a cruise. It happened to be Sydneys Mardis Gras, and the hotel was perfectly positioned for not only the train station (Museum) for getting off the ship but also to enjoy the weekends events. Were given apartment 102 which was on the 10th floor and included a balcony big enough to get 2 0r 3 chairs on it and looked right across the park at the War Memorial. Although we were able to see the participants gathering before the parade and some of the floats getting ready to go up Oxford Street we couldn't see the parade from the apartment but it was an easy walk to Oxford street to watch the parade proper.The parade was great but for the fact that most people in the front rows appeared to be standing on boxes and blocked the view of those behind so we went back to the hotel and watched the people from the balcony.The Hotel reception was efficient and polite - the one hic cup we had was that the TV developed a fault but was fixed immediately by the hotels service team.The apartment was well stocked with appliances including an iron and ironing board, dvd player, and the kitchen included a microwave. The hotel which some would consider to be slightly dated has obviously been refitted and was in pretty good condition with modern colours and interiors.The soundproofing in the room was excellent, with the balcony doors open it was a little noisy but noticeable difference when shut, unit included aircon.Would have no hesitation in booking in again especially considering it was in the same price range that I normally pay for a hotel.","March 2, 2019","28    Hyde Park Inn

Free parking was extremely tight but greatly appreciated. The room was spacious with plenty of storage space and it was great to have the tiny balcony looking right onto Hyde Park. The double glazing kept the traffic noise down at night.The two beds were comfortable and, although we only had breakfast once, the kitchenette would have been useful if needed. The supplied breakfast was very basic but ""Bahista"", a few doors down the street, had great coffee and good food. Our only complaint was in regard to the daily room servicing. The room was initially very clean but was not kept to that standard. Surfaces not wiped, beds just pulled up, wet towels not replaced (it was much too humid for them to dry in 24 hours). In general though we were very happy with our stay. It isn't a luxury hotel but offers all necessary room facilities and is good value.","January 23, 2019","28    Hyde Park Inn

But neverless the reception was great and helped us locate where we needed to drive to get the car back and also helped us to find the closest garage to fill up. So that was most helpful! The location is great close to all the places we need to go, museum metro turned out to be a good one for us as it was close to all the places we needed to go. The accommodation was good too, very spacious and was happy we got a proper bed for our toddler rather than your usual sofa bed as the extra bed. I would also like to point out the bathroom was very well equipped, normally with a lot of hotel bathrooms, there not enough hooks to hang stuff... something so basic, many hotels don't have... but this was really good, even had a place you could hang your washing, if needs be... so was very impressed... The location was also great for asian food, so much choice really, spoilt for choice!

The daily housekeeping was great and the room was cleaned well. I would certainly consider staying here again for its convenient location.","May 17, 2018","28    Hyde Park Inn

1536,"The Hyde Park Inn in Sydney was recommended to me by friends so my wife and I made a recent reservation to try it for ourselves. We requested a quiet, high room as we are light sleepers, especially when staying in a city. Upon arrival we were assigned a room on the 13th floor (out of a maximum of 15 floors) so we thought that we would not be too affected by any noise. WRONG!!The noise from chairs being dragged over floor tiles from the room above us and the rooms next door, continued late into the night and we hardly got any sleep. Thinking it could be a “one off” and the noisy clients may check out the next day, we did not complain. Unfortunately, the next night was the same. No sleep!! I complained the next morning to the reception staff and suggested to the duty manager that a simple remedy would be to fix self adhesive felt pads to the chair legs. After advising me that there were no available rooms on the top floor for us to move to, he said that he would investigate my complaint and advise his maintenance man to carry out my suggestion of the felt pads. There was no change that night and for the remainder of our 5 night stay. We had to resort to wearing ear plugs throughout the night which only marginally reduced the noise. We returned home today and are both looking forward to a decent night’s sleep at last. Such a waste of money to spend on a holiday when we could not get any rest. We will definitely not be staying at this hotel again until we are guaranteed this noise problem is fixed.","May 7, 2018","28    Hyde Park Inn

1537,"In terms of presentation the Hyde Park Inn is average, however, it has so many positives that you can't go past it. I chose the hotel for it's access to public transport. It is situated near Museum Station, with access around the corner in Liverpool Street, or by elevator on the corner of Liverpool and Elizabeth Street. Opal transport cards can be purchased from the 711 on your way to the train station. The local rail service gave direct access to the city, Circular Quay (Sydney Harbour Bridge, Opera House and ferries) and the airports. It's a 12 minute trip to the domestic and 15 minutes to the International airport. The bus to Bondi Beach leaves outside the station in Liverpool Street. The main shopping area of the city is a 10 minute walk or 1 train station journey. Free parking is provided by the hotel. Our room was spacious and included a small balcony and a lovely park view. Interestingly, they advertise more expensive rooms with a view of the park, however, all rooms have a view of the park. The windows are double glazed and although the website warned of noisy construction work, there was very little noise in the room. Breakfast is provided. I've seen some complaints about the breakfast, however, this is something that is not usually included in an Australian hotel's tariff and we found it more than adequate. Each person was left a small orange juice, fruit compote, small carton of fresh milk, tea and instant coffee, 2 slices of bread, small selection of spreads and a cereal. The room has a kettle, toaster, microwave and hotplate with a small selection of kitchen implements. The room was clean, comfortable and has been modernised in an inexpensive way. There is an excellent selection of cafes, bars and casual eating options and a supermarket at World Square on the corner of Liverpool and Pitt Streets. A daily internet allowance is included.","April 25, 2018","28    Hyde Park Inn

1539,"My wife and I had an early morning appointment in the CBD and picked the Hyde Park Inn as it was within a short walk of Martin Place and very affordable. I was a little concerned as I had spent a weekend there almost 30 years ago when in Sydney on business and I found it to be just average. Time has been good to the HPI. The rooms were small but very neat, clean and comfortable. A big bonus was they have free parking underneath the hotel and in Sydney that adds close to $40 in value. Their free breakfast is cereal, juice and bread for toast in the frig. Not bad if you are in a hurry and don't have time to chase down breakfast. The hotel is a short walk to Chinatown and the CBD. All in all a great value in the heart of the city.","April 17, 2018","28    Hyde Park Inn

1540,"Apart from the convenient location, the hotel was very disappointing. No lobby to speak of, indifferent staff, the smallest, windowless (and consequently stuffy and airless) bedroom, although well appointed. The ""included in the price"" (AUD220) breakfast consisted of slices of white bread, orange juice mini cartons, and coffee and tea sachets usually complementary in most hotels worldwide, and in our case, no space to consume it. Ignore the lure of the included breakfast mention when comparing with other hotel prices, especially if you are staying several nights.","April 4, 2018","28    Hyde Park Inn

1541,"I loved HP Inn. It's perfectly placed in the center of Sydney. You've got Chinatown to the right, and business district to the left. A short walk down to Oxford gets you to Surry Hills area. And the metro stations are all over. We walked from hotel to just about everywhere, including University of Sydney one day, to the Royal Botanical gardens the next. We used the Circular Quay as our primary metro stop to exit to ferry and visit places like Taronga Zoo and Manly beach. The hotel itself is very nicely located between a couple of big chain hotels. The lobby is small, but the rooms are big. We had a family suite and it was very affordable. The beds all slept comfortably. The light breakfast provided held us over until lunch everyday. And, the bathoom was good size too. We also had a balcony overlooking the Hyde park and that was a extra added touch. I will say there was dust on the TV stand and top of the headboards on the bed. You had to continually reconnect to wi-fi as there was a throttle built in, that had to be reset after hitting a certain amount of download data. But, I could have cared less about these two things given all of the other positives. The service was overall excellent, and that's very refreshing for a family coming to Sydney the first time. The front desk was knowledgeable and made check in/out very quick too. Thanks so much for making our trip awesome.","March 29, 2018","28    Hyde Park Inn

1542,"First, kudos to the hotel for letting us store our heavy luggage here for two days prior to our booked stay. We disembarked from our cruise ship and took an uber straight here and asked if we could leave our bags two days early because we wanted to travel light to the Blue Mountains. They didn't bat an eye and took our bags and even had the bags in our room when we did check in two days later. Great customer service for this alone!we had a nice hotel room with small kitchenette and a view of Hyde Park. Free wi-fi. Continental breakfast was provided the night before in our refrigerator, but it wasn't enough so I had breakfast at nearby cafes. This has an outstanding Hyde Park location and it was convenient for visiting museums and the Museum Train Station is across the street. The 380 bus to Bondi was nearby also.

Reception staff were very friendly on arrival and departure. They happily stored our luggage til our room was ready (we arrived early in the day to make the most of our trip so didn’t expect the room to be ready at this time). The room was spacious and clean, the beds comfortable and it was very quiet. After a huge night for Mardi Gras we all slept til 10am it was so quiet. The breakfast was replenished daily as needed and was what we expected having read the reviews. The room was serviced daily and the housekeeping staff always did a great job. The kitchenette was basic but had enough to get by. Museum station was directly across the road and it was an easy walk to Darling Harbour, Oxford Street, City Centre, Chinatown, basically every where. We would definitely stay here again.","March 18, 2018","28    Hyde Park Inn

The kitchen is good for self-catering (e.g full size fridge/freezer) and there was a 4-seat dining table and comfortable lounge chairs. The bed was very comfortable and there were large flat panel TVs in the lounge and bedroom. The windows could be opened for natural ventilation (which we like), and there was also full air-conditioning. A washing machine and clothes dryer were provided. We found the location of the hotel excellent – supermarket, shops and restaurants are all close by, and it is walking distance to Central Station and to Darling Harbour, yet the hotel is in a quiet street. There are plenty of public transport options within a short walk and we found the hotel a great base from which to explore Sydney. The only minor negative we encountered was a noisy bathroom extractor fan. We would definitely choose to stay at this hotel again – it is quality accommodation in an excellent location.","July 9, 2019","29    Veriu Broadway

1551,"Stayed here 3 nights. The first night while flicking through the channels the TV completely locked up and wouldn’t turn off! Someone came to look at it, when they couldn’t fix it either we were given the keys to another room on the same floor, but told to leave our luggage where it was and we could move back the next day. I’m not sure why we couldn’t just stay in the second room, but anyway, both rooms were excellent. There was a shopping centre around the corner, so with all the upheaval we bought something to cook ourselves, and our room had all the facilities not only to cook but also a washer and dryer, which is always welcome during a long holiday.The hotel wasn’t far from Central Station, and Darling Harbour was quite close, too. We asked at reception about the Hop on Hop off bus, but the very helpful receptionist said don’t bother, use the Opal train ticket, there is a cap of $2.70 on a Sunday. This great bit of advice saved us lots of money and we managed to see a lot for a bargain price. Thanks for the tip! I think the cap is only around $15 on a weekday though, so even a day in the Blue Mountains by train was a bargain. I’d definitely recommend this hotel.","June 5, 2019","29    Veriu Broadway

I dropped a tong and a menu on the floor, which were left that way without cleaning for the entire six nights’ stay. I asked for the floor cleaning on the second day, but no change. I left a $5 tip the third day to see if anything would change, but nothing. Hair was left in the shower booth as it is. A used cup with orange juice leftover was left the way it is. It got to a level where I started to get worried about the overall hygiene during my stay.

Our main problem was the weekend we stayed, we came back late and our key card did not work to let us back into the building. There are no staff members overnight working there at all! Which 4* hotel does not have somebody working overnight? What happens if there’s a fire in the place. Surely, that’s not safe. We called the number provided but nobody picked up. It was 1am and we were tired and just back from a wedding. After 25 minutes, miraculously, an other couple were going into the hotel and luckily our key worked inside and we could go to our room.

Easy access to CBD, Darling Harbour, Rocks, etc. Room and facilities were excellent, loved the free bike hire and staff were amazing, particularly Sanna who recommended a spa for a massage and, when we couldn’t immediately find it, walked us there. Overall, superb, will definitely come back","March 6, 2019","29    Veriu Broadway

Big balcony was nice, the AC worked well. Nice size bathroom and good shower. Bathroom amenities were renewed daily. Washing machine and tumble drier proved surprisingly useful. Good location and easy to get into the city, either walking or by bus or train. The crazy fish market is a 15 min walk away and well worth a visit for lunch!

If we didn't feel like walking so much, there were also plenty of connecting buses from Broadway (4 mins walk from the hotel) to the Central train station.The staff were generally friendly and helpful. A special mention for Phoenix, who welcomed us so warmly on our first day and made the check-in process so easy. He patiently answered all our questions and gave us very clear directions to the Central train station.The room had excellent amenities and was very comfortable. It came with a gas hob, dishwasher, good-sized fridge and freezer, washing machine and dryer.We looked forward to going back for a good night's rest after exploring Sydney each day.

But we were ontly with the two of us, so we transformed the bed into a sofa again and used only the bed upstairs. Nice terras! The appartment was on the 5th floor, right under the beautifull steel roof. No problem with the temperature, because of two airco split units. The personell is very friendly and the hotal has, instead of a anonymous lounche, a cosy bar for coffee, breakfast or other drinks. ","January 13, 2019","29    Veriu Broadway

We really enjoyed the quality coffee bar, on site nibbles, and GREAT happy hour. Our room was very spacious, contemporary in decor, and the location was excellent for us. Central Station was close enough to walk to and we walked all over Sydney from Veriu. (Sydney Harbor, Darling Harbor, The Rocks, Opera House, Botanical Gardens, King Street and more!!)

1594,"Close to $2k for 4 nights was way too expensive for what we received. It showed very little value for hard earned money. This place is a hybrid between a bed and breakfast and an Airbnb but not getting either right. Service is limited and poor. Coffee was disgusting there. Manning was skeleton. Not sure if it was because of the festive season or because they just don’t really care about service. In a nutshell, don’t bother.","January 7, 2019","29    Veriu Broadway
