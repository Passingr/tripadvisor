Also, breakfast is quite good. As soon as Park open we could head to, Also at night after theme park closing hour we could arrive hotel and took a rest easily. No need to have transportation is super good while we stayed here.","July 12, 2019","0     The Park Front Hotel at Universal Studios Japan

1,"I recently stayed at The Park Front Universal Studios for 2 nights and it delivered what was needed. I was definitely worried about the potential noise factor, being in a hotel with so many children; but really didn’t hear much of anything once inside the room.For all of the lobby glitz, the room was spacious, but basic. I was in a park view room with 2 single beds. The bed were firm, which I love. Though it was a twin bed, it’s not what we consider a twin in the US, it’s definitely bigger. Two kinds of pillows offered: thicker and thinner- which was nice.There is a separate toilet room and bathroom. They were fine but nothing special. The bathroom consisted of a shower and tub room, so to speak. The towels were very thin.The safe was big enough to fit an iPad and something the size of a folder, which was helpful.The blackout shades, though helpful, did not truly blackout the light come morning.The room overall was tired and a bit dated. That being said, for the location and price, I was pretty happy. We were literally steps from the park and from the train...so convenient. For those reasons, I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel if you want to be close to the park.","June 10, 2019","0     The Park Front Hotel at Universal Studios Japan

2,"This hotel is just right in front of the Universal Studios theme park and hence it’s the closest one can get to the Park! Our room besides being very comfortable and nice, also had a view of the Park from the windows! It was exciting indeed ! The hotel is also in the midst of many restaurants and eating places , also has several places to shop nearby , so in that sense it’s absolutely centrally located. The staff was very, very nice ! A very comfortable and memorable stay for us! We loved it! Thank you hotel team for making our stay amazing !! Loved it ! ","June 3, 2019","0     The Park Front Hotel at Universal Studios Japan

3,This hotel is literally at the front of the universal park. From the lobby to the park entrance is about 5 meters max. You are pretty much staying in the park!! Hotel is amazing!! Atmosphere is fantastic. There is so much to do in the universal walk and so many restaurants. I would 100% stay here again everything you need is only steps away and the hotel is very reasonably priced for the amazing location,"May 30, 2019","0     The Park Front Hotel at Universal Studios Japan

4,"Stayed here for one night after a long, tiring day at the theme park.We dropped off our luggage on arrival then headed for the park.Returned at night to check in. Our cases were already in our room.The room was very large with 4 comfortable beds.Lots of toiletries supplied as well as a hairdryer and a sleep shirt and slippers.Breakfast was amazing. Lots of choice, including a chocolate fountain and sweets.A late checkout meant no rushing so sat in the window enjoying the views of the park.Wonderful!

5,"Can’t beat its price and location to USJ. Good spacious rooms and beautiful scenery. The major complaint I have is the laundry room. The dryer does not do its job despite gobbling up my yens, innocent few more tries and fruitless feedbacks. For that I minus a star from the review.","April 13, 2019","0     The Park Front Hotel at Universal Studios Japan

7,"The hotel is very near universal studios so if planning to go there this hotel is a very good choice. It is also near their metro rail transit so after going to universal studios you can easily travel to a different tourist spot by using their train, which is comfortable, efficient and reasonably price. The hotel can further be improved by upgrading their facilities and renovating their rooms.","March 16, 2019","0     The Park Front Hotel at Universal Studios Japan

9,"We stayed here because it was close to the train, and it’s a nice hotel. We weren’t actually going to the parks, so it was a little silly for us to stay here. Going the opposite way as the park traffic every day was funny. I didn’t get the room I thought I was going to, but it was fine.","February 9, 2019","0     The Park Front Hotel at Universal Studios Japan

10,"This hotel is located literally 100 meters from USH gates.Some tips:- if you traveling with family from Kansai Airport, it is more convenient to go by bus to universal studio. It took less that an hour. From the universal studio bus stop it is like 300 meters walk to the hotel. If you travel by train, the universal city station is also very close to the hotel.- if you arrive early, the hotel will keep your luggage and they will have it ready in your room by the time you come back- you can purchase USJ tickets and express pass from the tickets counter at the 3rd floor (next to the check in counter)- breakfast buffet spread is awesome. There are an extended japanese and international selection. It is good value for money and best option before going to the park- for lunch and dinner there are numerous restaurants option in the universal city shopping & dining area. They are open until late.- there are luggage forwarding service (Ta-Q-Bin) at the 2nd floor. It opens from 7 am to 12 pm. I use it to send big luggages to my next hotel in Tokyo- They have a room with park view. It depends on your personal judgement, but after spending a whole day or two at the park I wouldn’t pay extra for that view. The room and bathroom is very spacious though- they dont provide iron & ironing board in the room but you can ask to borrow one.- there is lawson store at ground floor. It’s very convenient to buy some snacks, drinks and other stuff. They also sell electrical adaptor and other crucial traveling stuffs.","January 17, 2019","0     The Park Front Hotel at Universal Studios Japan

11,"Having a hotel nearby to go back to after a tiring day at USJ is awesome. The hotel room and the bath is big and I really enjoyed my stay there. I love spacious rooms (something that is rare in Japan).I didn’t go for the breakfast option as it’s quite expensive and there are a couple of good cafes nearby. I’m glad I didn’t as I see huge lines outside the cafe in the morning. I wouldn’t want to queue for my breakfast especially if I’m rushing to USJ. It’s a beautiful hotel and yes, I will recommend it if u are intending to visit USJ. Try the sushi place (revolving sushi) nearby as it’s pretty good! There’s loads of eateries where the hotel is. Try asking for the room facing universal studios. I think it’s more expensive though. However, from where I am (facing the other way), I could see fireworks display at night! :) ","December 19, 2018","0     The Park Front Hotel at Universal Studios Japan

12,"Stayed at this hotel from 2nd till 3rd Dec 2018, Room 2202 and 2203. The booking was made via online through their website. Check in process is normal and can be considered average. There is nothing special of the services rendered by the reception staff. My main concern is that no one assisting us (I come with my family of 5) with our luggages upon our arrival. We arrived via taxi at the ground floor roughly around 7pm. There is only 1 lady staff at the small concierge unit. Not so fluent in English and just told my family “check in upstairs “. We have to carry out out luggage on our own to the lobby by the escalator. She is not telling us whether there is an elevator or otherwise and till today I really not sure about it.Nothing to shout about the room as I believe on par with other resort boutique theme park hotel. Main advantage is just the hotel is near to USJ and located along the universal walk. The rest I think is average and could be a bit expensive and not worth of money.Breakfast is ok. Maybe it’s time for the hotel management to consider halal @ Muslim friendly food as the number of Muslim customers are growing fast. Another thing probably the tv channel inside the hotel could provide ‘live’ coverage of the theme park for information of its patrons. There is a counter selling tickets for the park inside the hotel which may benefit the customers. ","December 7, 2018","0     The Park Front Hotel at Universal Studios Japan

13,"The hotel's proximity to USJ and the bus station (bus to airport) is simply amazing. After 2 tired but fun days at USJ, having the hotel at a stone's throw away was great.It was also very fun to see USJ from our room window. We could see the queues, the crowds and the day/night scenes.The hotel had coin laundry facilities which was very convenient for us. The shops outside the hotel at Citywalk had a good variety of restaurants, supper snacks and souvenirs/gifts.","December 2, 2018","0     The Park Front Hotel at Universal Studios Japan

15,"We visited Osaka mostly for USJ and this is THE hotel to stay for such activity. It is located right on the heart of Citywalk just a couple of minutes walk to the park entrance. You can easily purchase the tickets and fast lane passes right in the hotel, so there is no need to queue at the park ticket counters. The room was huge and the view as even better. It was especially interesting to see what is going on after the park closes with all the preparations during the night. A must see for Universal Park fans. There is also a train station with quick access to other parts of Osaka. There was no desk or workplace for a laptop and given the room size, they could easily add that. There was a little disorientation by staff during check-out on where to go to catch a cab to the airport.","November 14, 2018","0     The Park Front Hotel at Universal Studios Japan

16,"So much to love about this hotel, the decoration and the overall fun vibe really made it a unique holiday for us. We got very lucky as our room had a direct view of the park and was quite massive for two people, with a massive bathroom as well. You are able to buy tickets for everything through the hotel counter which makes entire experience very convenient, this is the most hassle free way to visit this park. The food was okay, could be improved, but not entirely bad.","October 30, 2018","0     The Park Front Hotel at Universal Studios Japan

17,"We've stayed at the Park Front Hotel @ USJ on last Sunday night. We chose this property as we thought we might stayed until the park closed. We did arrive in the morning to leave all baggage then spent time at USJ. The check-in process is not complicated and take just 2 minutes. When we came back to the hotel, our room was ready and luggage was delivered to the room already. The room is big compared to Japanese standard room. The hotel provided all amenities we needed and specially the foot spa pads, it's very nice after you walked all the days at USJ. The decoration may not be super-fancy like you stayed at Disney official's Hotel but it's fine for me as we didn't travel with children. There is vending machine, ice machine and microwave on the floor we stayed (28th floor). Breakfast, we didn't expect much on this so it's beyond our expectation. The line buffet is great, there are variety of foods and we're really enjoy. We did book the room directly at Hotel's website as it's cheaper than the other website. Even hotel is not located in the city center but, personally, I still recommended this hotel for the others, especially, if you have a train pass and mainly use JR, not subway. The station is just <1 minute walk from the hotel.","October 24, 2018","0     The Park Front Hotel at Universal Studios Japan

19,"It is the closest hotel to the park. The best location we could ever ask for. Lots of restaurants and shops around the hotel. We had a corner triple room and it was really roomy, not only had enough space for two adults and two kids but also 3 large fully opened suitcases. Huge bathroom with double sinks, big and comfortable beds, large windows provided bright light and a great view of the park. Check-in was easy and quick. Mr Mochido at the front desk was so helpful and polite, he made our stay a better one.

Breakfast maybe not as tasty at traditional ryokan, but the food choice is awesome. You could pick takoyaki, mini burgers or stick to traditional breakfast spread.

21,"This is a beautiful hotel & only one minute walk from the park, but not worth the money. This was the most expensive hotel I've ever stayed in & there was nothing that made it better than the rest.Really uncomfortable pillows that meant a bad night sleep, breakfast was so unorganised that people were queuing for at least 30 mins while tables were empty but not cleaned, (it doesn't help that the breakfast area isn't big enough for the size of the hotel) then extortionate parking prices on top of the extortionate room costs.Hotel Keihan Universal Tower is right next door and cheaper so we'll try that one next time.","September 16, 2018","0     The Park Front Hotel at Universal Studios Japan

22,Pros. 2nd summer visits and celebrations for my husband. Close to USJ. Clean. Spacious room. Buffet breakfast ok.Cons. My husband brought some candies out for my daughter who did not goto conplmentary breakfast. A staff blocked his way and asked him to put back. I was outside & asked what happened. He showed me a sign & said loudly & rudely to me that this is rule not to bring any food outside.. My husband said a 3-year old child in front of him also got candies on hand was also asked to put back candies which made her cry. Why so rude? My husband then stayed for some more time. This staff talked & looked at my husband many times & laugh. This was the birthday of my husband & he had bad feeling. He said he would never visit this hotel again.,"August 23, 2018","0     The Park Front Hotel at Universal Studios Japan

27,Can't go wrong staying here if you want to go to Universal Studios. It is literally 100 meters to the entry gate. It is the closest one to it. Great view of the park from our side of the hotel overlooking the park. The buffet restaurant is probably the biggest I have ever seen its massive and does all the way around to the left hand side of the entrance. More food choices for breakfast than I have ever seen. Staff were great especially Koyama who went out of her way to print off some documents for me. Hotel is surprisingly quiet considering its location. Rooms area good size and very clean.

It's also within walking distance from the ferry to the Osaka Aquarium Kaiyukan and from the entrance to Universal studios. Couldn't have picked a better place. We were given room 2010 which had a great view of the harbor, ferris wheel, and neighboring hotels. The rooms are really large by local standards (ours had three comfortable single beds) and a nice bathroom with separate toilet (by that I don't mean shared, just its own separate cubby with door- really nice feature.)

30,"Loved the convenience of staying at the park front hotel. It is a especially wonderful for families with kids. Pluses:1. The location was superb for anyone visiting the Universal studios.2. USJ train station was right next to it.3. The Osaka bay ferry terminal about 5 minutes walk away. 4. Via a short ferry ride, one can visit the Osaka aquarium near by.5. The train station makes it convenient to go almost anywhere in Osaka, to Kyoto, to Nara. 6. It has more that 10-15 restaurants right around it so, food is not a problem at all.7. The most amazingly vast and varied breakfast Buffet with western, and Japanese cuisine. Especially fun for kids with multiple cereal, candy, fondue as well as ice cream options.8. The hotel has a time travel theme, and is a lot of fun for the kids.9. Festive atmosphere due to the location being right on Universal city walk.10. Very helpful reception and concierge.11. Huge spacious rooms with great views of the USJ Park and Osaka Bay area.12. Large spacious, and modern bathrooms with luxurious amenities.I could really so no negative, and had a great time.

Kids will love it. JR Train station is 5 min away and easy to take airport bus down from kansai airport as bus stop is nearby.

We have the view of the Hogwarts Castle and the USJ entrance. Surrounding the area are restaurants and shops wherein you can find affordable options for food and souvenirs.

33,"This hotel is ideal for Universal Studios as it is less than a minute walk to the park entrance and the train station plus right in the middle of City Walk restaurants so was perfect at the end of a long day in the park. We chose a city view room but could still see 50% of the park. Rooms were clean, shower was extremely powerful, reception staff very helpful and you can purchase park tickets plus fast passes. Breakfast buffet provided good choice of foods including smarties, flumps, and a chocolate fountain! When we booked we were surprised at the low cost (compared to Orlando Universal hotels) however were amazed at the high quality standard provided.

Hotel is designed for families with kids, but is acceptable for all types of travelers. The best part was the location - just a 2 minute walk from Universal Studios.

38,"I stayed at this hotel on a visit to Osaka with my family. The rest of my family are theme park fans and this hotel proved to be a very convenient choice because it is located right by the Universal Studios theme park. The hotel was very clean and comfortable and room sizes were good. When you exit the back of the hotel the universal city is right there , boasting of lots of different restaurants, shops, a huge candy store , a convenience store and many more. The train station is also located right by the hotel . If you mainly want to be right by the park, this is a great hotel since the park is a short walk to the universal studios park otherwise there is nothing else around the hotel, one has to either take the train or a taxi to go to other parts of the city. I was frustrated also because this is one of the few international hotels where very little orAlmost no staff spoke decent english. I think for being such a family oriented hotel with a western theme park, i think the hotel should be better equipped with a more multilingual staff. It was difficult to go to anyone , even to the concierge to ask for help with reservations or just simply to ask questions or make suggestions as to where to go other than the park.

Room was big and clean!The only down side is the tv as the channel are all Japanese and none of it was English or Chinese, no movie channel, if you want movie you have to pay additional which is not good as it’s the official USJ hotel but they did not provide any universal movie channel.

43,"My adult son and I stayed 2 nights this week for 37000 yen booked through the booking.com.iWe caught the airport bus from KIX to the bus stop at USJ.Catching the bus was easy.Easy to find and a person to help you buy tickets from a machine.About 1500 yen each.We arrived early and they offered us check in at 1pm for no extra.Reasonable English at reception.We had a twin room on the 9th floor (905).Although I paid for a city view room (park views cost more), we were given a park view.The Hollywood Dream coaster looked really close and we could see the crowds gathering at the entry gate.There was no noise in the room .The room was in new condition and very large with 2 extra wide singles and a sofa bed.It didn't have a desk/chair.The beds were not too hard, with nice bedding and 2 pillows , one of which was soft for Westerners and one Japanese style.There was a separate toilet and a large bathroom partitioned into an area with 2 sinks and a wet area with a large bath and shower.We went to USJ for one and a half days.I was disappointed because not much appealed to me.I like Tokyo Disney SO much better.It was a 5 minute walk to the front gate which was wonderful for an early start and for returning late.Both nights we had food from Lawson's for dinner.We had a nice Japanese lunch in the park one day and a so so lunch at the Three Broomsticks the other day.We ate cereal for breakfast brought from home in our room.I used luggage forwarding on the second floor.They had enough English to help me.I can't recommend luggage forwarding enough.There is a self service laundry but I didn't see it.We took the bus to Itami airport on departure.It was raining so we took a taxi, lined up on the street outside the 2nd floor entrance, although it was only a short distance.We arrived at the bus stop 15 minutes early and there was already a queue.I highly recommend this hotel if the purpose of your visit is USJ.No negatives about the hotel at all.","February 10, 2018","0     The Park Front Hotel at Universal Studios Japan

Also, the train station is very close to, with also around 3 mins by walking.The hotel room is spacious and having great horizon views on higher floors.Only thing that tourists need to consider is that if we need to travel to city center of Osaka, this hotel is quite far from city center and needs several transfers by train.We will definitely go back to this hotel if we plan for a family trip to Universal studio Osaka.","January 18, 2018","0     The Park Front Hotel at Universal Studios Japan

46,"Hotel was booked because it was so close to universal. It is close by taxi to the Osaka aquarium and LEGO land, however public transport is not so quick if your goi g from the hotel to either LEGO land or the aquarium as you need to change lines and they line to the aquarium and LEGO land is not on a JR line which means your JR pass won’t work (but only a small fee). Taxi from Shin Osaka to the hotel is approx ¥6000 depending on time of day. Getting into Osaka city is quick by JR Tain from Universal City. The hotel isn’t central to everything, but if your willing to travel a bit and have the money (not for budget trips) it’s worth the stay. Area surrounding the hotel is known as Universal City (Same Name as the train station). It has some cool shops as well as heaps of restaurants. Good pricing varies depending on where you go, however value is good in General. Hotel breakfast is great and can’t complain. Hotel is super convenient to go to Universal studios. We went on our last day just as the park opened at 10am. We checked out and left our bags at reception and went straight to the park. Lines where moderate and I’m glad we didn’t have to wake up earlier to get there from Osaka or further away. Once we finished at the park (around 6:30pm) we walked back to the hotel and got a taxi back to Shin-Osaka Would definitely stay again if I’m back.

49,"Being right in front of the USJ entrance brings out a massive sigh of relief from tired parents coming out of USJ - and it was great to come back to a good hotel after a full day at USJ.Location - its approx 1 hour 15 minutes using the airport express bus from Kansai airport and it stops at the bus stop, about 5 minutes walk away. Its flat all the way so no problems with pushing those roller bags - you will be walking past the entrance of Universal Studios and then voila, you will see the hotel. We actually stayed a full week in this hotel even though we did not go to USJ each day. While its not in the main part of Osaka, you have the Universal City train station right next to the hotel. Getting to Namba is about a 20 minute train ride away, which for us was not a problem as the trains are frequent enough. We in fact did day trips out to Kyota and Nara without much hassle. The hotel is part of the Universal City Walk so there are plenty of restaurants to choose from. The hotel has a Lawsons convenience store in its premises, and there is another one just outside - if you get hungry, the Lawsons sells plenty of food - both hot and cold, as well as some of the most fabulous, value for money desserts. Try the cream puffs!The rooms are large and long - so for us, we had 4 beds next to one another, in a very long, slightly narrow room. No issue with the room size, it was comfy enough and pretty large for Japanese standards. Fantastic bathroom amenities, spanking clean, wifi was good. If you can, do get a room that faces the park. It is lovely to see the park during sun rise, and we could also see the fireworks every night from the Christmas show. At the same time you can see the Tempozan Ferris wheel, which is very pretty in the night. The hotel was great with providing accessories for our toddler - like bed rail, and stool which was fantastic. Tickets for USJ can be bought in the hotel and charged to the room. This was useful as you do not need to queue at USJ to purchase the tickets. We had the buffet breakfast each day - pretty good variety, with a Japanese/Asian slant, but quality is very decent, and plenty to eat. We love how they deal with the crowds very efficiently - so even during the peak hours, food is topped up, and queues are manageable. A slight issue would be the difficulty in communication in English, an issue that is not just in this hotel so its not entirely a criticism. We had problems trying to understand the USJ express pass system, and had problems finding a money changer (Which by the way is in the Keihan hotel next door) and problems finding a route to the airport without using the taxi.Our communication with the hotel staff was difficult due to the language barrier. While they were always polite, they were not necessarily helpful in providing proper instructions - again, likely due to language. So if you need help with directions, train schedules, train routes- use Google Maps. It was particularly helpful when figuring out the train system.","December 14, 2017","0     The Park Front Hotel at Universal Studios Japan

Staying late to watch the Christmas show knowing that the hotel is near after a long day was great.- check-in was a breeze.- I took domestic flight to osaka, round trip for limo bus was a breeze.- I like how their bathroom and toilet are separated. Cons:- universal city was fun to walk but limited choices of food. Need to travel out with at least 40 mins train ride. I recommend this hotel just for USJ stay for a night or two. Do travel light to get here (I.e a luggage will be sufficient for 2 to 3 people), it will be easier for you. ","December 1, 2017","0     The Park Front Hotel at Universal Studios Japan

Got a standard quadruple room but was upgraded to a superior with park view!The room is big though with 4 beds a bit cramped but we don't mind. Bath room is separate from toilet and everything is so clean. There's also a lawson store with atm inside the hotel and a coin operated laundry.A bit far from Osaka proper but for us it served its purpose because we were already dragging our 7 year old after spending an entire day in the park.

Since all the hotel rooms are located above 14th floor, you can enjoy nice city view.The best of all was the customer service. I found that I left my sunglasses at the hotel after a week from staying the hotel. When I contacted the hotel they found my sunglasses and sent it back to me using my Fedex account.

87,"It was my first time to visit Osaka after having visited Tokyo a couple of times and was looking for a central and accessible location to explore the place as well as partake of the food that Osaka has become synonymous with — boy did this hotel not disappoint. The location and the accessibility of this hotel is its main draw but don’t be fooled because the rooms are very comfortable and some have been newly renovated too. The Hotel is very near, in fact has access directly, to one of the most well known Japanese Malls - Takashimaya which is not only a good place to shop but is also a great place to eat whether it’s in one of the restaurants or grabbing something at the Basement Food hall! Accessibility from the airport and other nearby attractions like Narra and Kyoto is another draw of this hotel as it sits on top of the train station. If shopping is your thing but you’re not really into malls, this is still the location for you as you there are numerous 100 Yen stores around and it’s located in one of the two shopping districts of Osaka - Namba. It’s close to Shinsaibashi-suji which basically is the 600 meter connection to Umeda (the other major shopping district of Osaka) ","May 7, 2019","1    Swissotel Nankai Osaka

91,"I recently stayed at the Swissotel Nankai in Osaka and the following was my overall experiences. +- Centrally located location- it was easy to get around because the Namba station is right below the Hotel. We were traveling from city to city to wanted to be as close as possible to our train stations and this helped out. + Easy to get to from the train station- there are signs underground that lead you to the right direction. - Rooms are tiny, the bathroom is small- this was by far the smallest hotel we stayed throughout our Japan trip. - The main entrance to the hotel comes from the street/train level and that's the only entrance I found aside from the taxi stand. It's inconvenient when you are upstairs looking around at the shops and having to go back down to that level to take the elevator back to main lobby. Overall, I would recommend this hotel based on the location only. That's about it if you have a lot of luggage or bags it's going to be cramped quickly. I would recommend going elsewhere if you don't mind being further from the Namba station. ","April 27, 2019","1    Swissotel Nankai Osaka

I went with my wife. I had to come down and ask her to give me one queen size bed room as per my reservationI did not get to room till ! PM. The executive floor is nothing but cheap wine and finger food. We do not drink alcohol so it was waste of my money. It is not like Ritz Carlton Club level.I enjoyed my stay in Tokyo, Kyoto . But I found this hotel check in staff did not care for me. I was there for fun not business . May be they deal with more business customers.","March 30, 2019","1    Swissotel Nankai Osaka

106,"Nice large room but after the superb Peninsula in Tokyo quite disappointing service and ambiance. The concierge was literally never there over three days and two nights. When the heat did not work, instead of sending an engineer they sent a bellman who could only (uselessly) turn up the dial on the thermostat. It also turns out they charge 9,000 yen/night to open the advertised fold-out couch in the junior suite for your child to sleep on - it felt like a bait and switch. With no concierge the bellman was nice enough to make a dinner reservation, then spoiled it a bit by telling me firmly twice not to be late. The food in the executive lounge was skimpy - it turns out they will make you eggs, but the waitress did not come over to tell us and take an order until we were nearly finished eating. So in nearly every interaction, the staff betrays poor or non-existent training. The result is that the Peninsula makes you feel like royalty, Swissôtel like they really don’t want you there.","March 24, 2019","1    Swissotel Nankai Osaka

108,"Great property. Service is exceptional and the rooms were great. All of the rooms we have stayed in on our trip were very small. These rooms weren’t as small as the other places but smaller that what you would see in the US. Very nice rooms, clean, well taken care of. Can’t say enough about the quality of the room. AC worked magnificently, kept the room cold, actually had to turn it up. Turn down service at night. We had pizza delivered on Monday June 8th and we waited at the entry to the hotel. The young men there in top hats were very helpful. I wish I knew their names. They were on duty on the 8th around 3pm. The delivery driver forgot to leave the drinks. One of the young men didn’t pause, he took off running to find the driver (I had already walked in the hotelBefore realizing I didn’t have drinks). He came back several minutes later, drinks in hand. Not sure how far he had to go but that was a wow moment. Great job and I hope these guys get recognized for the extra service. ","July 8, 2019","2    The Ritz-Carlton, Osaka

117,"My wife and I were part of the Tauck Tours to Japan to see the Cherry Blosooms and we decided to arrive a few days early for our own private pre-tour of Osaka. The Ritz Carlton Osaka (RCO) is a luxurious 5 star hotel with all the amenities you could ask for.There are several restaurants housed within RCO making it very convenient to choose dining at these high end restaurants. Splendido is Italian, however, since we were in Japan, we wanted to try Japanese cuisine on our first night in Osaka. But, at Splendido, breakfast is a good option providing a buffet and ala carte menu. If you are not big breakfast eaters, Ala Carte is the way to go as the cost is quite high for buffet. If you are not comfortable with left hand driving, as Japan is like the British system using shuttle and taxis is the way to go. Taxi's are queued up at the front of SCO for really easy and secure selection of taxi cabs and reliable drivers to and from your hotel. Check to be sure, that they accept credit cards, best way to conserve you Yen for other travel purposes. Toilet are TOTO, our first introduction to the high tech world of a toilet seat greeter upon entrance to the compartmentalized toilet area. If you choose, you can get an automatic sprinkle wash of your bottom with a warm soothing water spray with a variety of water pressures. What we didn't know is that most of Japan has move to a total ""TOTO"" approach, including public areas of transportation and most high end establishments. Looks like this is going to put a dent in the toilet paper industry!Our room had a great view of the harbor being on the 30th floor with spectacular morning and evening views. We came for the Cherry Blossoms and sad to say, Osaka experienced an extreme cold snap a few weeks before loosing most of it's blossoms. However, if you look far and near you will find some trees with a variety of floral colors. On our first day, we went up to the garden area and found one tree with a few blossoms! We realized that this might just be a indication of what's was to come...Little or No Cherry Blossoms!","May 8, 2019","2    The Ritz-Carlton, Osaka

127,"As a business/event partner/venue, Ritz Carlton has never disappointed given the top notch event organization capacity, service standard, professionalism, amd of course location itself is a big plus as well. But as for individual guests, I have to say this time the experience is a bit underwhelming as my third time here. First of all, the hotel needs a renovation. The rooms and facilities are old. Not the old-charm heritage type of old, but worn out. Service has also become average. It doesn't feel like Ritz Carlton, although the brand has done all it can to undermine that Marriott ownership, which I don't blame them. But it hasn't really delivered the traditional Ritz standard either. More English training is needed for front desk and concierge staff, otherwise this feels like a local chain. The housekeepers need to be more detail-oriented (i thought we are in Japan, excuse me?) to avoid constantly putting back empty toilet amenities without replacing them, or to do better in the night service. Again, if this was for a normal hotel, I wouldn't have ranked four star. But it still carries the Ritz Carlton name, I would assume and expect higher standard. The only standard it never seems to miss is pricing.To be honest, I wonder how this type of old-school so called luxurious hotels stay competitive in an environment that people's travel behavior has fundamentally changed. Anyway, not my problem. ","April 12, 2019","2    The Ritz-Carlton, Osaka

The location is great and the staff is really friendly and attentive. The food could use some improvement. I am specifically talking about the breakfast buffet and the chocolate buffet (yes a mid afternoon buffet that serves everything with chocolate) the quality in my opinion is not at a Ritz standard.

The room wasn’t new but they maintain it well and the bed was comfortable. I have nothing to complain except the strong smell from the toilet.

154,"Checkin was the worse. We arrived at 1:30/1:45, we did not get into our room until 4:30. When we arrived we were advised the room wasn't ready. Others checking in at the same time were able to get into their room without an issue. We are platinum elite status so are entitled to a room upgrade, but were told they didn't have any. That was fine. After waiting 15 minutes, they took us to the room. We asked for a nonsmoking room, when we got to the room, the room smelled of smoke, or perhaps just musty and dusty. Went back to front desk for a room change. Again, no room ready. Front desk manager gets involved. He said he could upgrade us but room would not be ready until 4:30, by this time it is 3. We are too late to get lunch, most places stop lunch at 2:30-3. I asked manager for access to the lounge to make up for the terrible check in experience. At first he said yes, but when we came back he said the he would only charge us 12,000 yen ($107) per day for access to the lounge, discounted from 80,000 yen ($700)!!! This is a ridiculous price. I went on line and the difference in price between the room I booked and the lounge room was only 8,000-10,000 yen, but he was giving us a break at 12,000 yen!! So they did nothing to make up for wasting 3 hours of our time.The hotel is very stuffy, both the furniture & décor and the air. There was no good air circulation in the lobby or bar. Bar on the 5 floor is a cigar bar, very smelly. They charge 1,900 yen per person cover charge. 2 drinks with cover, tip & tax was almost $100 to sit in a hot smelly smoky bar. They even charged a 15% service charge for the mini bar in the room!The room was nice, if you like that style. Again, all felt stuffy. Breakfast was very good, many options. WiFi worked well. Concierge was not particularly helpful with picking restaurants. I’ve stayed at Four Seasons previously, I’ll stick with them.","October 23, 2018","2    The Ritz-Carlton, Osaka

The hotel is really nice, with nice big room and great attention to details. They have the sleeping wear for the adults and the kids. They have also prepared the kids tooth brush and slippers for our kid. Also, they have a nice swimming pool that separated the lap area and kids swimming area. If you plan to swim, please remember to bring your swimming cap. Also, if you have a tattoo, you would have to cover them up by wearing a rashie. They also have rashies to loan you if you do not have one. Around the hotel, the shopping areas are close by with lots of good food. The hotel itself has a wonderful Japanese restaurant.

158,"I visited The Ritz-Carlton, Osaka while traveling around Japan with my husband for our honeymoon. This was our first time in Japan, and we decided to stay in all of The Ritz-Carlton locations in the country.The Ritz-Carlton, Osaka blew our expectations out of the water. Out of all of our Ritz-Carlton stays in both the U.S. and around the world, The Ritz-Carlton, Osaka has been our favorite by far.Our check-in experience was the smoothest we have ever experienced in all of our travels. Upon driving up to the hotel in a taxi, our luggage was already taken care of by the staff. We arrived at the Front Desk and were greeted by a very friendly agent and immediately served water. We booked their standard Superior Room with a King bed, but because of our honeymoon celebrations combined with our rewards membership, we were given a beautiful Suite on their Club Level.We were escorted up to the Club Lounge to proceed with the check-in process while enjoying drinks and treats. The Club Lounge itself is breathtaking and the food served is full of flavor.Once we were taken up to our room, we saw beautiful amenities set up in celebration of our honeymoon both in the living room and in the bedroom. The staff went above and beyond to wow us, and it worked! I almost cried seeing the beautiful set up in the room. They placed photos from our wedding throughout the room, with balloons, sweets, fruits, sake, and personalized origami. The room was comfortable, impeccably clean, and provided stunning views of the city.We also really enjoyed that the hotel was within walking distance to a lot of shops and restaurants, and most importantly, Osaka Station. It is a great location and allowed us to adventure throughout the city without ever having to take a taxi.However, what really stands out in this location is the staff. Every single staff member we walked past greeted us and offered to provide assistance with anything we needed.It is unfortunate that we only stayed here for one night and couldn't fully take advantage of all of the hotel amenities. Overall, we enjoyed this hotel so much that it will be our go-to accommodation when we return to Japan. We cannot wait to come back and stay here for a longer period of time!","September 26, 2018","2    The Ritz-Carlton, Osaka

We've stayed at other hotels in Japan and were really happy that the non-smoking floor didn't smell of cigarettes. Sounds weird but if you've travelled in Japan you'll know what I mean! The rooms were spacious enough and the bathroom, while not opulent, was perfectly fine. The hotel is close to Kyobashi station, which was great. We had a number of suitcases and it really is a 5 minute walk from the station - just follow the instructions on the hotel website. We went to Universal Studios and it was very convenient to jump on the train. There's a Family Mart under the hotel which is great. Note that there is a fridge in the rooms but they're empty, so you'll need to stick up. There's also McDonalds and Subway restaurants over the road if you're feeling the need for something ""western"". All in all, we enjoyed our stay - the rooms were clean, air conditioned (it was really hot when we stayed so a/c was essential), the staff were helpful and friendly and the location was good.

The room was small but not as small as the Ibis Styles Kyoto Station. The room itself could have been more soundproof as I could hear people talking quite distinctly in the corridor. The hotel itself is quite grand and even has an onsite onsen, which I didn’t use. The setting of the hotel is good as it’s just beside a river and the area around the Business Park where the hotel is located is quiet, although lacking in atmosphere. The hotel offers a 11,000 yen taxi service to Kansai airport which was very convenient and I recommend.

Great location close to JR Kyoubashi and Keihan shopping mall. Just north of the mall is a large cluster of little restaurants all collected together over a couple blocks of alleyways, with many dining choices. Looks like lots of locals go there, so not all places have English menus, and prices are very reasonable. Definitely not a touristy place! Hotel Montery Lasoeur itself is beautiful -- lots of wood and polished stone, and an old English chapel on one floor which is popular for weddings and such. Rooms are well-appointed, good amenities, very clean and relatively spacious for a Japanese hotel.

When you arrive at Shin-Osaka station, you have to catch another train to Osaka station, THEN catch the loop to Kyobashi. It's a bit complicated, but once you've done it the first time it's easy.Fairly easy walk to Osaka Castle 20 min-ish.Staff were very helpful, and spoke good English. The room was pretty tiny - but no more than is usual for Japanese hotel rooms! A laundry for guests to use would have made the stay even better.Breakfast was included with our rate... it wasn't fantastic. If you got there after 9, most of the hot food had gone cold.

You have quite a few things (malls, restaurants, riverside) within walking distance and both the train station and subway are around the corner. Yet, you are not in the middle of all the hassle. The breakfast is something you don't see too often... Both Eastern and Western, and of course pastry :)The staff are VERY polite, as Japanese always are. I want to give them ten points for handling a minor incident. I don't want to go into details, but they accepted responsibility immediately and showed us good will afterwards. Also, when my wife had a birthday, they remembered her (I think I mentioned them she has a birthday during our stay). Made us feel appreciated.I would, and I think I will come here again. Next time I will bring the kids too. We went here and there and we think this was a great place to start your journey wherever you want to go, including Nara, Kioto, and Kobe.

From Osaka airport (KIX) to the hotel is almost door to door if you take the train that connects to the Osaka loop, and you don't even have to get off to switch to another train. The ride takes about 80 minutes and there's a 10 minute walk from Kyobashi station to the hotel.The hotel is next to the Osaka Business Park, and there are numerous restaurants all around as well as shopping malls. And because the subway is just 10 minutes away, you can connect to just about anywhere in Japan.I stayed at probably the smallest size room at this hotel, but it is actually very good size by Japan standard especially in big cities like Tokyo and Osaka. And because the hotel is located on the upper half of the building, you can have a pretty good view of the city. The breakfast doesn't have a huge variety but plenty enough and good quality.

192,"The purpose of our trip was to join a wedding lunch so we chose a hotel which could be in a walkable distance to the venue. The hotel is close to Kyobashi JR station and Kyobashi Keihan line which is around 10-15 minutes by walk. It is convenient traveling to Kyoto by Keihan line and to Umeda and Shinsaibashi by JR Osaka Loop line. Also, Osaka Castle is nearby, just around 15 minutes walk. It is definitely worthwhile to go! Such a beautiful and comfortable place to take a walk! Since we were there for a special occasion, the hotel upgraded our room and prepared some gifts for us. It was very appreciated for their kindness! However, there are some points which I want to raise up and hope the hotel to review on that. First of all, the hotel did not offer any help if you want to post any post card. This is so surprising that a hotel does not have this service. This should be a basic service but unfortunately they do not. This is so disappointing and shocking to hear that. We need to find a post office and buy stamps ourselves! Secondly, if you ask for an extra key card, you have to pay for it. I think usually this only happens to 2 or 3 star hotels but yes it happened here. We were travelling as a family group, and needed to look after each other so it would have been more convenient to have an extra key card. However even we took our family's passport to the reception and requested, the answer we got was to pay for extra. Although it was not expensive, it was annoying to us. Overall, the stay was okay.

195,"The good things first - the location of the hotel is good with a JR station just across the bridge with a covered walkway. It helped us immensely on a rainy day. There is a 24 hours’ convenience store below the hotel, which was pretty big and keeps pretty much everything you would need during a vacation. I could find diapers there. There is a McDonald’s and Subway just across the road as well. Osaka castle is also close. The hotel has free and good wifi connection.Things I didn't like include rooms the size of pigeon holes, no room service of any kind, restaurants that close very early, inflexibility with any kind of late checkout request with even an extra hour being charged. Frankly, for me the no room service is the deal breaker and had I known earlier, I would not have gone there in the first place. You need the comfort of in room late night dinners, especially if you are out walking and sightseeing all day!Now, the reason why I would rate this a 4 out of 5. We had sent our luggage from Tokyo via courier and they messed it up. We were probably the 1 in the million case. The front desk staff Hayama-san took over our case and she personally worked with the courier company to ensure that the luggage was re-routed to our next destination. I would have missed entire days, if I had to stay back at the hotel to work with the courier company. It helped immensely that she spoke to them on our behalf, negotiating the language barriers and explaining what needs to be done. She also kept on updating us by email throughout the day.

197,"When you're going to a few different hotels in Japan, you will notice that they are tiny compared to the western world. This was the only hotel out of three that I went to where the bathroom felt big enough for two people. Which is a massive bonus for when you want to relax after a long day of exploring. It's located directly next to a bridge (that actually connects to the hotel) that goes straight to a food area, or straight to two train stations, with a third relatively close. It's close enough to everything to be worth staying at, and the beds were comfortable, where most beds in Japan are stiff, this one was a nice change.The pricing was also amazing, I wasn't expecting what we got for the price. I would suggest asking for a view window, as we didn't (expecting to just be given one, due to the pictures) and we pretty much got a wall. So, make sure you ask!The entrance is amazing and feels so much more expensive then what came out of my wallet. Reason for 4/5 is staff didn't stop the teenagers running up and down the corridors at 1AM for the whole 3 night stay I was there.

207,"I would put my rating as average - as our negative experience may have been a 1 in 10. We booked the semi-double from the website - reasonable price, ok looking room. When we arrive, the room was not at all bad, but somehow bizarre and a little odd. The decor seemed out of place with the rest of the hotel, and we had a peek to other rooms being cleaned and none of them looked like ours. On the top floor, and on the last end of the wing of what seemed to be a full hotel, we barely can hear people and so there was an eerie feeling about the place. In our room there was an odour in the bathroom and close to midnight, we found ourselves restless and unhappy with the room - so we upgraded to the suite as it's the only room available. The suite was a lot better - I would believe we were staying at the hotel we booked. The bed was comfortable enough and the view was great. There was also a dedicated toilet near the entrance, however none in the main bathroom on the other side of the room. Staff is very helpful and the breakfast buffet is pretty good. Also a short walk from Kyobashi Station - but beware, Kyobashi Station is a unattended maze and the West Exit is not easy to find. Walking distance to Osaka Castle and there is a Family Mart attached to the building. Very unlikely for us to return, but won't discourage people to stay.","July 20, 2015","3    Hotel Monterey Lasoeur Osaka

208,The hotel is located at little bit away from the hustling Osaka city. I booked a double room single occupancy and the size was adequate for a 3* business hotel. Not too big and not too small. The room itself however has no charm as visible on the pictures. Even though the hotel looks new the rooms are already slightly worn out. You don't have a side table at the bed so you have to use the table from the room. Improvisation talent is what you need. Very disappointing for me was the dirty day cover on the bed. Even though the rest of the room looked clean you keep this picture in your mind implementing there could be some more which wasn't the case. I wouldn't stay here the next time as they are alternatives downtown for about the same price in the same category.,"July 15, 2015","3    Hotel Monterey Lasoeur Osaka

210,"My husband, teenage son, and I stayed there five nights. Having never traveled in Osaka before, let alone mainland Japan, it took a couple of days to get our bearings. But by our last night, we knew absolutely that Hotel Monterey Lasoeur had been the right choice for us.- Great neighborhood: Situated in Osaka Business Park, it's wonderfully quiet at night. It's directly across the river from a bustling commercial neighborhood with plenty of shopping, hole-in-the-wall restaurants, and other distractions. A covered walkway runs directly into the JR rail station, a shopping mall, and the Keihan mainline. The OBP subway station isn't too far off, and Osaka Castle Park -- a huge urban park with plenty of historic architecture -- is five-minute walking distance.Word of warning: We took the JR line in from KIX. The hotel's instructions on railway arrival are only good to a point. They don't tell you how to get to the hotel FROM the rail station, which is very disorienting -- especially when you arrive, jetlagged, after sundown. From Kyobashi Station, exit at the west gate and head straight past the newsstand onto the covered sky bridge. At the end, take a left to cross the river, then another left, staying on the covered walk. The hotel entrance is clearly marked a few yards away.- Great accommodations: It's hard enough traveling with three adults, harder still when you're sharing a room. Monterey Lasoeur has three-bed rooms that, while snug, still fit us very well. The beds were about American full, so while they wouldn't sleep more than one adult, you could still spread out. They were firm, but with some give (which I came to appreciate after some other hard-as-rock mattresses on other stays of our trip). The bath was western style, with plenty of hotel complimentary items. AC worked magnificently, a godsend given how hot and humid it was outside. Open wifi made our internet planning that much easier. Beyond the room, the hotel sports an Art Deco motif, very lovely. It has plenty of in-house restaurants and other amenities, though I can't say we partook all that much. We had the breakfast buffet: tasty and quite well-stocked, yet a little spendy. Directly downstairs is a 24-hour Family Mart, so we could always catch a quick morning or evening bite, when scheduling prohibited a proper sitdown.- Great service: We never had any real issues with language barriers; there was always someone on staff with very good to excellent English skills. Everyone was polite and beyond courteous. They held our bags for half a day, as well. Always appreciated.","July 7, 2015","3    Hotel Monterey Lasoeur Osaka

I would say average in my scale. Overall I needed a quick stay for a day before i headed back to Tokyo. So I would say not bad to stay for a quick nap. The Location is good. Ask for front side of the view room. The Windows gives a nice view of the outside Castle.The best is when i arrived it was before check in time. I had to go for a meeting so the reception staff really were helpful. They kept my luggage gave me a no card. And whole day i was out doing my meetings and all.

214,Not a great location if you're traveling to and from Osaka to other cities as a tourist. Very long walk from Kyobashi station to the hotel especially with luggage. And some platforms with no elevators so made it even more difficult. Osaka loop line is a very busy line so going somewhere between 8-9am was very tough. I would rather spend more money and stay at Osaka station. Rooms were okay. Nothing spectacular but not bad either.

216,"We originally booked a standard double room (at 175U$/night...) and ended up in one of the worst bedroom I have ever encountered in any 4/5 * hotels in Asia.Room was a cubicle, with a queen bed stuck in one corner and no possibility for 2 adults to walk freely without bumping into each other. No decoration whatsoever, not a spot of colour to remind you that THIS was not a Motel 6 in Nowhereville, USA.. The bathroom was even worst: dated back to the late 1960's, with a tub, no shower area per-se, a plastic tub curtain and depressing wall tiles...Add to this the numerous hairs from the previous guests we spotted all over the floor and tub, AS WELL as the bed bugs crawling onto the bed sheets, and you get a pretty good idea of how high the management holds its customers.After having shared our..annoyance -understatement- (crushed bugs in hand) at the reception, things definitely improved. The Front Desk lady, apologetic, courteous and efficient took the initiative to up-grade us.Our new room, a Deluxe something, was perfect, as if set in another hotel.

221,"We stayed on the premium floor and in a junior suite as there were 3 of us. Room is spacious and nicely decorated with good colour scheme. Windows are closed and opened by controlling with buttons at the head of the bed, same for lights. There is an area near the main door where we can park our luggages and hang our clothes plus a full length mirror. Bathroom is equipped with a good sized bathtub and adjacent is the shower. I especially like the control for shower heads, the off and on buttons, only knob is the one for temperature control Complimentary sets of bathroom necessities are aplenty, always well replenished day after day. The toiletries brand Mikimoto cosmetics is not bad but the body lotion is too liquid not really to my liking. The toilet is in a separate area and really is a proper toilet in itself with bidet and a tiny sink. Also like the Toto washlet with control buttons to enable flushing, cleansing and opening/closing of the toilet seat plus cover. Bed and pillow firmness are just right and beds face the window, which means we can look outside at the city from 28th level. Able to see the Ferris wheel from the room. There are 2 TV sets, one in the sleeping area and the other in the sitting area. We all love the Bose SoundLink Bluetooth speaker in the room and ended up buying one from BIC camera;).As One Harmony members, we were allowed to eat breakfast at 3 different restaurants which serve Japanese, intercontinental food. We kept going back for the Japanese breakfast because of the yummy tempura. But if we went late only the veggies tempura were left.;( Our welcome drinks became farewell drinks as we had the drinks on the last day of our stay.

234,"Location, location, location. This Nikko Hotel is definitely in a centralized location but that’s where my compliments end.This hotel fails the high quality standards we’ve come to expect of the Nikko Hotel brand. Let’s start with our check-in. After sorting out how many room we had actually reserved (They showed four. We had two since we were traveling with family. Thank goodness we had a printed copy of our reservation as proof), the front desk kept insisting that we have two beds in our room. My husband and I (we’re a gay couple) kept telling them no, we want one bed in our room. Keep in mind Japan is supportive of LGBT rights plus, the Nikko Hotel is a transnational corporation so my recommendation to the corporate HR folks is better training. Once we got into the room, we were even more underwhelmed. The room showed its age. Since it’s winter, the hotel doesn’t have air conditioning, just heat, which means we got into a stuffy hot room. The only thing that cools down the room marginally is a portable humidifier/fan. So that basically stayed on the entire time we were in the room which cooled the area down to about 75. There was mold around the room’s air vent and the bathroom looked like it hadn’t been updated in years. The uploaded pictures show the mold plus some holes in the bathroom tiles from some prior repair work, I’m guessing. We saw large groups of tourists in the lobby so my guess is the hotel caters to tour groups more than it does to the individual travel. If the hotel wasn’t linked to the Nikko brand, is give it a higher score. But because it is, it only gets ⭐️⭐️. Probably wouldn’t come back to Nikko if I returned to Osaka. There are probably other hotels close by that cost as much with better amenities.","December 28, 2018","4    Hotel Nikko Osaka

It is very hot in the rooms and the option the hotel gives is to switch off the heater and sleep in the sauna of a tiny room that you're paying hundreds of dollars for. Tiny windows are all sealed so there is absolutely no ventilation. Hotel Nikko is obligated to state this to guests prior to booking or to highlight this on their website, but they would rather deceive customers.ALSO, HOTEL NIKKO IS NOT ACCESSIBLE WITH A JR RAIL PASS!","December 17, 2018","4    Hotel Nikko Osaka

238,We stayed here for 3 nights and we love this hotel. It’s located strategically within Shinsaibashi area and we can just walk to the market and shopping areas. Front Desk & Concierge people have been very friendly and helpful. The room is relatively small for 3 people but this is considered to be normal here in Japan as most hotel’s rooms are smaller here. Toilet is neat and clean and bed is fairly comfortable. We tried the Japanese breakfast buffet on the 3rd floor and we like it. Overall it was a good stay for us. ,"December 14, 2018","4    Hotel Nikko Osaka

The subway brings you to everywhere of Osaka.Room: Bigger than the usual size of Japanese hotels, very clean and tidy.Breakfast: The hotel offers 2 types of breakfasts – normal and Japanese, both in buffet styles and offer many varieties (even ice-cream!), tasty and fresh.Services: Typical Japanese attentive, polite and pleasant.The only shortcoming is the hotel’s free WIFI, its reception was weak and unable to use.

Typhoon Trami hit japan as we were due to travel down to Osaka, so we requested that our two night stay be moved back by a few days. The hotel outright refused to do this. We contacted our travel provider who spoke to the hotel- the hotel only agreed to move our dates if we cancelled and rebooked. The hotel knew full well rebooking at this late stage would cost us more money, which it ultimately did. At check-in they provide guests with complimentary drinks vouchers to have a free drink in one of their bars.

252,"This is our first trio to Japan. We tried to chose the hotel based on quality and location. The Nikko hotel scores very well on both accounts. It is located near the Dotonburi sector where most of Osaka's restaurants are located. The hotel is also near subway stations (you can access from the hotel basement) and is directly situated on the luxury shopping Avenue. The staff greeted us with warmth and kindness and our room was very comfortable. I am glad to say that we finally have had the opportunity to enjoy a traditional Japanese breakfast. All our hotels included breakfast, mainly to prevent from having to hunt for a place that serves breakfast in the morning. We were looking forward to our Japanese breakfast but we were disappointed with the choices in our previous hotels. Not here at the Nikko hotel tough. There is a restaurant on the 3rd floor where they serve only Japanese breakfasts in the form of a buffet. Grilled marinated salmon and mackerel, sardines, steamed vegetables, cold soba noodles, Japanese omelets (made to order), Okonomiyaki, steamed rice and more items I have forgotten about by the time I am writing these lines. Quite amazing. Exactly what we have been waiting for.Great staff, great location and amazing Japanese breakfast","September 10, 2018","4    Hotel Nikko Osaka

Pleasantly spacious, and always clean. The beds were comfortable, the bath and shower were great. Accessories/amenities were always replenished sufficiently and clean.

259,"This is my second stay in this hotel and this time we wanted to stay longer to enjoy Osaka and its neighboring areas of Kyoto and Nara. It is undeniable that this hotel has the best location if you want to check out the shops and restaurants in Shinshaibashi and Dotonburi. Daimaru Department Store is right across the street, most of the high-end boutiques are on the strip, America Mura is close by, as well as one of my favorite stores for knick knacks, Tokyu Hands. There is also a Starbucks and a McDonald’s nearby which is a big help when it comes to feeding picky kids. The subway also runs beneath. However, that’s about it. This hotel is expensive and you are paying for the location. The rooms are small, although very clean. The air conditioning in the room was horrible! I could hear people’s footsteps upstairs, the breakfast buffet is mediocre (for me at least), and the worst part is the the airport shuttle only stops intermittently and only on some selected hours. If you have an early flight out of Osaka, for example, there is no bus and the hotel does not have its own shuttle. They will, however help you rent a van for exhorbitant prices!

Osaka is a food paradise and you will be spoilt for choice. For those who embrace the amazing Japanese train system : the hotel is directly connected to exit 8 from the South-North and South-South gates of Shinsaibashi Station of the Osaka Municipal Subway Midosuji Line; Shinsaibashi Station of the Nagahori Tsurumi-ryokuchi Line and Shinsaibashi Station of the Midosuji Line are connected by a walkway.

The bed was beautifully comfortable and we slept well with no noise.There are 2 family marts and a 7-11 store behind the hotel for small supplies, drinks, snacks etc, which proved very useful.

They look really good and taste at least as good.Tomorrow evening we are dining in Wajo a tepanyaki restaurant in the St Regis. I will be writing my review on Trip Advisor then.We have so far only had two of three days here at St Regis. It is an amazing experience. They have been wonderful.It is so nice to have old school classy treatment from the new young generation of service people.A special mention for Matsu who helped my wife arrange surprise birthday things like rose(he provided without charge), beautiful fruit plate, cake and candles. We arrived on my actual birthday and all these wonderful things were awaiting me. Thank you Matsu.It certainly makes me want to look for St Regis in every corner of the globe.I commend management all the way from the top down for how they select and train their staff. Thank you.","June 11, 2019","5    The St. Regis Osaka

276,Our last night in Osaka was spent here after 10 days of touring. Five star service from arrival to departure including welcome kits for children traveling with you. All staff speaks English and if you are a Gold or higher level of Marriott Rewards you automatically get late check out until 2pm - well worth it. Butler service at your fingertips and comfy beds and robes. We booked thru Hotels.com and got an incredible rate for under $300 a night. A must is a cocktail in the lobby bar. Stunning artwork and a serene place to kick back and enjoy a drink. ,"June 7, 2019","5    The St. Regis Osaka

277,Stayed here for a few nights during a Japan trip. The hotel itself is in a decent location and in a newer building. Entrance is on the ground floor and front desk on an upper floor. Welcome was quite nice and we could check in right away. Front desk team was always very nice. Also the concierge service delivered a high standard and arranged several things in advance. The room had a great view and is equipped with a lot of amenities. It's already a few years old though. Room size was quite good also bathroom which had no rain shower. There is a butler box to service when you are in the room and don't wohnt to be disturbed great idea!The service in the bar on reception level was not up to par. It always took a while to get served and they were not always good organized (outside) . One evening it was even worse inside the bar. Could be a great bar with an awesome terrace but had been disappointed.There is no pool or jacuzzi available. Leisure outlet is very small in general. Expected more in this high end class and prices.In total a lot of good impressions and some which can be improved. ,"June 3, 2019","5    The St. Regis Osaka

At this point and point, this stay and property has been my favorite in the world. You just have to experience it. Pros:Staff - polite, professional, and really good at guessing your needs before interacting with them. Concierge - was able to get us into a popular great restaurant on short notice. Bar/beer garden - actually very fairly priced with great bartenders On site restaurant - only did breakfast there, but the food was all great as well as the waitstaff. Rooms - spotless, especially in the bathroomsLocation - great location and you're right above a subway lineCons:This is something that the hotel really can't control and won't change my mind. But some guests are very rude and don't understand the concept of lines and shared spaces. Every morning at breakfast there were groups of people who decided to cut the lines at the hostess stand and seat themselves as well as letting their kids run around free screaming through the restaurant. If the staff could be more vigilant about looking out for that putting that to an end it would be great.","May 28, 2019","5    The St. Regis Osaka

282,"We stayed here for 3 nights and had 2 rooms. The hotel is very conveniently located near the train station making it a great place to base you travels in Osaka. Overall our experience was positive but did not meet the St. Regis expectation we had from our stay in Mumbai. The positive, the rooms are very nice, spacious, comfortable and well stocked. The concierge in the front went above and beyond my expectations, as when I asked for information, they not only provided me the information I was looking for (where to eat, what to see, directions) but also printed out information and highlighted other things that I can do there including shopping, restaurants, how to go from one place to another. They were all fantastic. It helped given we spoke English and else would have had a more difficult time navigating. Now for the let downs, I had communicated it was my daughter birthday and they were bringing a cake, and when they did they said happy birthday to my wife, also the butler service was not great, e.g. we would order coffee but it would come with no milk or creamer, and when I asked for it, it took extremely long that coffee was cold and it happened multiple times. The turndown service was also inconsistent, one day they would restock the bar, and one day they would miss something. Again nothing was bad but it wasn't what you expect when you book a St. Regis. I would stay at this hotel again and I would recommend it but they have work to do","May 7, 2019","5    The St. Regis Osaka

The rooms were also beautiful and the location is excellent. I want to make a particular mention of Kazuyoshi Matsubara, who is the senior concierge at the hotel and who assisted us immensely during our stay there. It is really rare to come across a member of staff who is extremely knowledgeable, funny and kind - for example, he helped us with putting together personalised itineraries to visit different cities around Osaka and even walked us to a restaurant himself so that we wouldn't get lost. I would wholeheartedly recommend the St. Regis Osaka to any person who asks given we had such a wonderful experience.","May 1, 2019","5    The St. Regis Osaka

286,Never stayed at St. Regis before and now am a fan bc of the butler service. First we arrived very early but was allowed to check in few hours later. Rooms were very spacious and nicely organized. Butler service was excellent!!! We did not need to use a tour guide as a result and visited many nearby cities in the area. They recommended itineraries and we had a lot of questions and last minute restaurant recommendations and changes. All the restaurants were spot on ( locals only places and specialized regional foods). We utilized the ironing service and pillow service ( who knew there were so many different pillows to chose from). We had a flawless stay in Japan and would return to St. Regis again!,"April 6, 2019","5    The St. Regis Osaka

It is also located in a very convenient location for Osaka, with a metro station right beneath it. A covered walking street full of shops and extremely good restaurants locals eat in is literally around the corner. So, what went wrong?- We were offered a welcome drink by our butler upon check-in. We opted for iced coffee but apparently they ran out of skimmed milk. We were rendered speechless, to be honest.- The concierge team was well-meaning but lacked the level of efficiency & courteousness one would expect at St Regis- A dinner at La Veduta was adequate but ultimately very forgettable.

We were staying as part of our honeymoon and the butler brought us a lovely piece of cake to celebrate. The bed was incredibly comfortable and we slept like babies. The staff were very helpful and we absolutely LOVED the location of the hotel. It was perfect walking distance from Dōtonbori (25 minute very easy and fun walk through Shinsaibashi-suji, a covered shopping street that is north of Dōtonbori) so we could experience all of the incredible craziness of that neighbourhood in the evening, but then head back to the classiness of the St. Regis which is located along Midosuji street which has a reputation for being akin to the 'Champs Elysées' of Osaka. The hotel is also a half hour walk to Osaka Castle or a very easy 10 minute taxi ride away. Also, like all St. Regis hotels, the lobby just smells expensive and delicious.

292,"We just completed 2 nights stay at St regis Osaka from total 6 nights in this trip. Before we move to St regis, we just completed fantastic stay at Westin Osaka with huge suite room upgrade. As Ambassador elite member, we have been upgrade to Grand deluxe which is one catagory higher than my booking. It is slightly disappointed for small upgrade since there are many higher catagories room available in Marriott application. Anyway, it is not a big deal. Platinum elite and above will have complimentary breakfast and 3,000 y per night minibar credit which is nice. Check in is smooth and room is in good condition but nothing spectacular. It does not have feeling on high end brand like in my other st Regis Experience. Unfortunately, I have met one bad experience during the trip on my 2nd day morning. Eventhough this is my personal vacation, I would like to spend my short time to greet with one of my VIP Japanese customers in the hotel. After I finished breakfast, I go to check with front desk and ask where in the hotel I can find the space like lobby lounge to have a cup of coffee with my VIP guest. One of the lady replied me with slightly impolite word that our hotel does not have place like that!! I might be confused with Japanese calture or it is limitation of Staff English communication. It felt pretty disappointed particularly when I am top tier Marriott member. At the end of conversation, she suggested me to go to Breakfast restaurant and have coffee there. My VIP guest and I go to ground floor restaurant at 10.10 am and we just ask tables and order 2 cups of coffee. During our short conversation around 20 minutes later, same staff that recieve our order told us that restaurant is closed and we need to leave to sit outside now which is pretty cold. I am very flustrated and want to make a bill immidiately but my VIP guest is ok that we can move to sit outside. After we finish meeting and one of staff said that they will not charge for coffee since they need to ask us to leave restaurant. For me I would rather pay for (only) 2 cups of coffee and sit inside. The rest of stay is fine. Concierge team is very nice and they always are very helpful. Breakfast is good selection. In overall, it is OKAY stay but you might expect more from St Regis brand.

If you're travelling by train, it is easy to get to from the JR line and well signed.

Location between main area was very convenient for me that I had to visit both Namba area and Umeda area in one day. On top of that, their butler service was exceeding my expectation with great service inclding their ironing service(important for me for that I had been traveling over a week by then) and welcome drink. What I have found out on my last night of stay was that you can even have butler make a bubble bath for you! You guys should try. I rarely leave any review on Tripadvisor but this one was worth my time! Thank you St. Regis! ","November 22, 2018","5    The St. Regis Osaka

Start from arrival at the hotel, the service is 5* from the reception, concierge and restaurant, service was Excellent!The room was perfect with a very nice view, the baby crib standard to asian hotel size, a bit just for western size baby but works at the end. Room service was good and with fast reactivity for request.We were absolutely taking care by the Chef Concierge Matsubara San and his team who were amazing and give us the best addresses for restaurants and sites to visit. They really help us for our stay from finding good restaurants for my pregnant wife and a good nanny to watch our infant while enjoying a night out.The Director Marie was fantastic and give us the best service I ever had. Totally available to help us during our stay.Restaurant was good and service too. Only one bad point would be the breakfast which is limited for seating and can make you wait a few minutes. However this was settle on our last day when they opened the second floor for breakfast.To resume, a very friendly and professional staff with great location close to the shopping street and amazing sushi restaurant.

315,"Very conveniently situated about a railway station, and close to an arcaded shopping strip, this is a beautiful hotel, with lovely common spaces, an excellent (and very expensive) bar, and a 12th floor garden. The room we had was spacious enough, had a large bathroom and walk-in robes as well as a floor-to-ceiling window with views over the (very clean) rooftops – which resembled, I thought, a work of art in themselves. Breakfast was very good, in a smaller space than these hotels usually provide, and did not feel as if everyone was desperate to eat as much as they possibly could. Not the usual bun-fight, in other words. Customer service was, of course, excellent. I did think, however, they were very mean with the in-room coffee capsules: just two were provided. Although, of course, you could always ask for more.","September 21, 2018","5    The St. Regis Osaka

We were guided to the room and offered welcome drinks with an advice for a drink based on the time of day and the temperature outside. Also, the sheets and bathrobes were incredibly soft. We slept like babies! Moreover, the spa treatment was excellent with a variety of choices and staff that saw to our every need. At last, the inhouse fine dining options and cosy bar (with garden terrace and live music) made the stay complete.

318,"Had an opportunity to stay at this wonderful hotel in Osaka. It is a 5 star hotel that for the most part, lived up to its expectation. I book the resort via SPG (basic 2 double beds) while my friend booked via Amex FHR. I got a decent rate and was excited to see if this hotel lived up to the hype. I contacted the hotel using the butler service and was able to have them help with dinner reservations. Overall a nice stay.Hotel/Location: This hotel is located in a nice area with many eateries near by. IT is about a 20 min walk to Dotonburi with lots of shopping and eating along the way. ITs still a 45 mins car ride/bus ride to KIX. The area is quiet. Most of the cab drivers knew where it was. There was also a fantastic Ramen place about 10 steps away. Biggest gripe was the elevator situation. YOu have to take 1 set of elevators to the lobby. Then walk to another set of elevators to take to your room. A bit of a hassle. Checkin/Service: When we arrived, I was a tad confused by the check in process. The concierge desk is on the first floor and they ask for your passport and info. We arrived at 10am and they told me that my room would not be ready til 4pm. I was ok with that. However, my friend (who booked via Amex) said that he had early check in. She didn't know what he was talking about but she took us to the 12 floor (which is actually the lobby). She didn't allow our wives to come up (didn't make sense). So we followed her up and found that there were 2 registrations desk. The workers politely had us sit down and began explaining things to us. Initially the first gentleman didn't know what he was doing. He tried explaining things but was confused. The manager stepped in and corrected things right away. We both got upgraded and our rooms miraculously was ready. This whole process took approx 30 mins (way too long). But we were given water bottles in the meanwhile. WE were then escorted up another set of elevators to the 18 floor and shown our room. Soon after, a butler appeared with welcome drinks and gave us the tour of the room. From then on, service was really good. Anything we needed was quickly attended to. We were given daily comp bottle of water. 2 articles of clothing were available to be pressed free of charge daily. Turn down service was nice. Comp coffee can be arranged to be brought to your room daily. Everyone was polite and gracious. Valet guy even walked us to the ramen restaurant and helped us order from the vending machine. Great service all the way around. Room: We got upgraded to a corner room grand deluxe. It did have 2 beds, not a big deal. But was huge compared to our other hotels in Seoul. There was a walk in closet with ample room to hang our clothes. The bathroom was huge with a big tub (had its own tv), separate toilet area, and big shower. The shower had 5 nozzles with the best water pressure I have ever experienced. My showers lasted 200% longer due to this. Towels were soft and ample. The bed was comfy. There was a pillow menu that you could choose from. Lighting was great. Ample plugs. No USB charging station. Wifi was fantastic. There was a coffee/tea station, but we didn't use it cuz we just ordered coffee. The view was amazing. I loved the room.Amenities: I utilized the workout room. IT was ok. There were 2 treadmills, and 2 elipiticals. There were dumbells that went up to 20kgs. But it was kind of small. There is not pool. I didn't utilize the restaurants.Overall, an amazing stay. I would return.","August 23, 2018","5    The St. Regis Osaka

321,"Picked St. Regis because of a great summer special rate. I would say the hotel itself is well maintained and has a nice polish to it. Very tasteful decor and does not feel dated. The main lobby is on the 12th floor....and the concierge/bell service/buffet are on the first floor....so you have to go up 2 sets of elevators to reach your room. In some cases, this could be annoying but this hotel was not too big, so the amount of traversing is not that much.Rooms were standard U.S. size...bathrooms were spacious. Our room was on the 19th floor and it was a corner room, with a view in the bathroom. i liked the butler service....you get free pressing for 2 garments a day, which is really nice.Internet was reliable and free. Amenities were high quality and there were enough US. sockets in the room..and location for sockets are well thought out. they provided a welcome drink after being escorted to the room which is another nice touch...and you get 2 complimentary water bottles a day. Toto bidets...standard issue. Shower is nice...strong pressure and have horizontal jets. There is a cool butler closet so they can deliver stuff too you like ironed shirts and laundry without ringing the doorbell and you answering the door.....they have access to this closet from the outside. very cool.Location-wise - Ideal if you like to stroll to the dotonburi and shinsaibashi stretch. Its literally at the end of shinsaibashi....so, you can walk all the way down to dotonburi....then grab a subway (midosuji line) at namba station and ride back to Honmachi station. The honmachi station exit 3 is literally across the street from the hotel.....so, after a long walk...you dont have to double back...you can take the subway for 180yen back to the hotel.....and continue the next day and just ride down there if you want to continue where you left off.....2 more exits down at Dobutsuen-mae station is Shinsekai...which is really cool shopping/eating area...highly recommended and has a very local feel. So, if you are just staying around Osaka...this is great. But if you are using Osaka as a hub, and going to Kyoto, Nara, Kobe daily....you will have to take a subway to Osaka station then take another one to nara, kobe or kyoto. This is not that big an issue, but an extra step....in this case, i would probably choose a hotel closer to osaka station if not inside the station to reduce this extra step....the problem is, it wont be as nice as the st. regis...and service will not be as good. Overall..if you dont have bad knees like me....and dont mind the extra subway ride....then St. regis is worth it.service wise - Excellent friendly service all over. The check in was a bit slow but it is probably because of the Obon holiday, and there were a lot of people waiting. We also arrived during check out times so, it must have been really busy. But, regardless, i feel they should have more than 2 tables to accommodate for more people...i mean, in other top brand hotels...theres no front desks anymore...just a bunch of people holding ipads and checking you in as you sit in the lounge. anyways...no big deal...but the system could be more efficient.Concierge - i want to give a special shout out to the concierge team...especially Kazuyoshi Matsubara, the Sr. concierge who was great at setting up my nightly dinners and making sure im taken care of.The Bar is very nice...although i wish there was more selection of cocktails. But the bartenders were very skilled to whip stuff up to my liking. No Pool....so if you have kids, and you are travelling in the summer months.....this might be a deal breaker. I opted not to get the breakfast buffet package...even if they were giving it to me for a discounted weekly price. Thought about it, but read from previous reviews it was not that great...i should have tried at least one day to form my own option. Next time.Overall....i highly recommend this hotel....would go back.","August 17, 2018","5    The St. Regis Osaka

325,"We stayed here with group of families in April19 (cherry blossom's season). We moved from hotel in Uehonmachi’s area to this part of USJ for 3 nights. The rooms here are indeed very spacious compared to the last we stayed. Is clean, comfortable and modern. Here are the following points about the hotel.Pros :1. Conveniently located. Once you get off the train at Universal City Train Station, The Singulari Hotel is right at the exit gate.2. Very spacious (with additional day bed), clean, modern and comfortable beds and easily can accommodate up to 3 adults size.3. Plenty of restaurants, cafes (ie Starbucks), pharmacies, convenient stores and shopping shops nearby ie GAP and Hard Rock. Recommend to try one particular restaurant ie “RA-MEN” Produced by Kotan (if not mistaken located at 5th floor Universal City Mall). Is tasty and value for money.4. They have a skyspa (Onsen) (both indoor and outdoor) and is free to hotel’s guest which is a plus point. Great relaxing place to dip in our tiring legs and bodies. However do check beforehand for certain peak/crowded time)5. Good Japanese branded toiletries such as body soap and shampoo provided inside the room. Other toiletries stuff such as razors, head bands, sponge and etc are freely available at the lobby for Hotel’s guest. No body moisturizer provided though. 6. Excellent water/shower pressure.7. Close to USJCons :1. No complimentary drinking bottled water provided. Were told tap water is safe to drink. 2. Bit far from downtown.3. Sound proofing not too good.

326,"I had booked this hotel a few months in advance based on room size (in comparison to other hotels in the area) and a quick read of the good reviews. I was shocked to see so many negative reviews just before we were to arrive. I still felt optimistic and glad I was as the stay was great. The room was a double and it was large! Having travelled over a week in Japan it was one of the largest rooms we had (as you may know Japanese rooms are normally on the small side). The room had lots of suitcase space on sofas that line the side of the room. The room was clean and downstairs they clearly provided all extra amenities that you could need. A lovely little addition was that you could purchase an English movie on their TV for 1000yen (£6) to watch and this was so good given we had been travelling japan for over a week. The staff were helpful at reception regarding universal studio plans / tickets (we had pre bought ours online), however, we did wait approx 5/10 mins to be served as it was busy most times. The breakfast was average but included many good simple foods (pastry’s, toast, fruit, cereal) along with other dishes (pasta, eggs, sausages- not just as good). However, the ‘hot’ food wasn’t overly hot. Other than that, the restaurant was clean and served its purpose... It’s all you really need going to the park and it was nice to sit and have a coffee & food before a busy/long day.  They have a skyspa (Onsen) separated by sex. We didn’t have time for this but it did look great. We used the laundry facilities (washer/dryer machine on the top floor) and these were relatively good but they don’t fully dry your clothes in one shot (we did a second Dry only go and this got them 95% there... there are hangers in the room for the last 5% :)) Overall, the last few negative reviews seem alien to me after our experience. Would happily go back if visiting Universal Studios Japan again! :)","April 23, 2019","6    The Singulari Hotel & Skyspa At Universal Stud...

I originally booked a ""City View"" and was placed in an extremely tiny room with a view of the Refinery factory next door. When I asked about it, front desk supervisor told me there was ""No such thing as a City View here"". Our bathroom smelled like sewer and vinegar to which the Supervisor noted that ""All bathrooms are like that here."" The walls are Paper thin! We were woken up abruptly every morning around 6:30a- 7am, by what seemed to be a Rugby team in the room above us. The worst part, upon check in- I was given a notice that I could not use the onsen spa upstairs due to my ""tattoo"" on the back of my my neck. The rooms do not offer complimentary coffee, and you will have to grab all toiletries downstairs at front desk. The only upside was that the hotel is literally right above the Train Station, so it was very accessible, however, the train station operates early and makes lots of noise.

334,"We stayed in the singulari king room for one night then the normal king room for the next four nights. beautiful nice modern and comfortable stay. Very good location, next to the train station. Walking distance to universal studios and connected directly to it by the shopping area universal city walk. Lots of food places in the area. we love the singulari king room, top class facilities with a private onsen as well. The breakfast was ok, not a big variety, seating capacity was small so we had to queue for a while before we can get a seat. One unpleasant experience we had while checking out. We woke up slightly late and couldnt make the very unusual 11am check out timing. We rushed and managed to check out by 12noon and they charged us 2000yen for late checkout. I tried to plead with them to waive the charge but the staff at the reception couldnt understand what i was trying to say, we had to leave so we just paid the 2000yen.","December 11, 2018","6    The Singulari Hotel & Skyspa At Universal Stud...

335,"Just outside the train station and a 5 min walk to.USJ!Small rooms but functional with a sofa bed which can easily accommodate up to 3 pax. Very clean rooms and toilet, beds and pillows were comfortable.Quite a new hotel, help yourselves to the basic toiletries at the lobby.Nice breakfast including a variety of western and Japanese food, very tasty.Only negative would be the extremely low sink, which can be quite a pain literally to bend down when brushing your teeth and washing. But it seemed low sinks are quite common in most Japan hotels :(Overall for the price and location, it is really value for money and i will consider this hotel if i come back to USJ again.

336,"We booked the suite with the private outdoor bath. The room is clean and small (expected) but my main issue is the use of space. 1. There is a huge outdoor seating at the balcony area and also a couch in the room. After the bed, there is hardly any room to open our luggage (it's too cold to take it outside in autumn). I would prefer to forego the couch for more space instead.2. There is no safe. We wanted to take only the essentials to USJ but alas, no safe to put our valuables.3. There is no towel rack. We had to leave it on the couch instead -_-4. The size of the wastepaper basket is too small. Couldn't fit anything else after throwing a plastic bottle.5. Weird placement of TV. It is at the side at the corner of the room.6. The coin laundry uses the same machine to wash n dry and it doesn't dry well. I'm left with wet laundry in cold autumn with no where to dry them. I would suggest the hotel to get a separate dryer machine. It worked better when tried at other coin laundry in Osaka.Anyway there is also good things about the hotel worth mentioning:1. Big outdoor bath. Comfortable to fit 2 adults. 2. Location wise very convenient. Not the closest to USJ but it is next to the train station. 3. Staff was very helpful n accomodating.","December 2, 2018","6    The Singulari Hotel & Skyspa At Universal Stud...

337,"- Great location! (Right NEXT to the Universal City train station) and a couple of minutes walk to Universal Studios entrance. - Comes with a rooftop onsen (both indoor and outdoor) to soak in your tired body and legs after a long long day. (u need that, trust me) - Skylounge with nice sofa and full glass window view of the port- Variety for breakfast should be improved though. I'm sick of having the same dish for 3 consecutive mornings. **Tip: Book the room without breakfast. there are lots of breakfast choices just outside the hotel (at Universal City Walk) and much cheaper too!","November 28, 2018","6    The Singulari Hotel & Skyspa At Universal Stud...

338,"We had a ‘deluxe room’ which I think is their entry level because it was very compact even by Japanese standards and didn’t have a closet or safe. It did have a mini-fridge and kettle so you can have your own food/drinks there (you can stock up from the convenience stores you pass on the way to the amusement park). The room wasn’t a major problem for us as it was merely a base for going to Universal Studios Japan, which is literally a couple of minutes walk away. It’s also right next to the station entrance/exit so no problems finding it. You can buy your USJ tickets at the hotel reception to save queueing at the park entrance.","October 30, 2018","6    The Singulari Hotel & Skyspa At Universal Stud...

The hotel is modern, reasonable sized rooms, great breakfast.We did not book this hotel for the Universal Studios, but for the location.Staff does not speak English though, but there is a Parking Supervisor ,Miss Chow, who is from Keelung, Taipee, and speaks fluently English , helped us tremendously. Only minus point was that we paid for the breakfast, but had to leave 5AM in the morning for the airport and Hotel was not willing to give us a sandwich instead, Breakfast opens at 7AM.","June 5, 2018","6    The Singulari Hotel & Skyspa At Universal Stud...

344,"I've stayed at the Universal Port Hotel and that one was farther compared to this one. Since its new, I didn't expect too much. However, the hotel was just right in front of me once I came out from the Universal City train station, so that was a plus. The lobby was classy looking albeit abit small. Toiletry supplies were strangely left at the lobby area as well, so you'll see many guests, or not, grabbing many items, though there was plenty to go around. There is a skyspa but never had time to try. We got our USJ tickets here too. No hotel restaurant, but quite a number of restaurants outside the hotel, around Universal City, but they close at 9 or 10pm I believer, so after leaving USJ during closing hours, we had to grab food from the nearby convenient store, which was very crowded during late nights coz everyone had the same thought of needing food/supper after 10pm. Not the hotel's fault tho. The room was great, very spacious for my family of 3 and even had a lounge type cushion that could fold into an extra bed Only issue I had was that the AC remote was all in Japanese and not sure why, but the AC would switch off randomly for no reason. I had to wake up to turn it back on again so I guess it was faulty. The pyjamas provided were very nice quality and designed. One more thing, the lobby staff English could be improved a bit more I think.","April 6, 2018","6    The Singulari Hotel & Skyspa At Universal Stud...

345,"Their standard rooms are pretty small. But for the amount you pay for it worth it. However I find their staff completely lacking in English communication skills, for a hotel with this caliber I was expecting better, especially compared to other hotels I have stayed in Japan. They even double charged me for the room. I only realized it when I left the country. But it would be a nightmare to try contact them as no one speaks fluent English at the counter. One thing that bothered me is I found some old slippers and some rubbish under our bed. Location wise this is the perfect hotel if you are visiting universal studio.

Amenities were great...in the lobby there is a bench where you can freely grab all the extra amenities you need.Location is perfect! Right next to the Universal City train station & a 1 minute walk to the beginning of the Universal City with tonnes of restaurants, cafes, etc.The staff don't speak much English, but enough to get by.

I loved the room, simple, modern, and very comfortable. They provide you with PJs every night, so no need to pack on your own! This is very exciting for US travelers not used to these amenities. We loved the proximity to CityWalk for nightlife and dining. We went to Starbucks every morning right next door so we didn't eat breakfast at the hotel to save some money. The front desk staff spoke decent English, and we had no language barrier issues.","December 13, 2017","6    The Singulari Hotel & Skyspa At Universal Stud...

348,"We found this hotel from USJ official website. This is one of their partner hotels. This hotel is also very new. Everything about this hotel is perfect except the parking is really expensive!! We paid about 3900yen for overnight parking. And this amount turns out to be the most expensive parking we paid throughout our 12 days driving trip. The check in is fast, the staff are friendly & prompt in answering any queries. We have book a room for 3 pax. And our room comes with 2 super single beds and a couch by the window. They have provided 3 sets of towels and toothbrushes but the couch doesn't comes with blankets or extra pillows. We were too tired to call for extra blankets and pillows so the 3 of us just slept on the 2 beds which is still quite comfortable. They have a public onsen on the top floor which is really perfect & what we need after a day of fun & action at USJ. Just 2 minutes walk from the hotel is a mall full of restaurants, I think there are 3 storeys all full of restaurants, also a takoyaki museum and we also saw 2 Lawson nearby.

Definitely no regrets from the additional cash we have to pay. Hotel is very modern (just opened Aug 2017) and room was very comfortable and spacious. Complete amenities, with a Sky bath and relaxation room on the 14F that sets it apart and unique from other hotels along USJ City Walk.

352,"I really like this modern Japanese hotel. It's very young, just one week old since opening. The reason I choose this hotel is because 1. It's just outside Universal Studio Japan, 2. It has an amazing public bath. Staff is friendly and I did not mind they have to bring out their cheat sheet to talk to me in English, most of the guests are Japanese. It's ok they are doing the best to communicate to a forginer. I do not find that unprofessional as long as the message is clearly communicated. Room is clean and comfortable. You can obtain a lot of information form the TV system.Public bath on the top floor and it's so good, open air bath was very refreshingBreakfast is typically Japanese style international breakfast, food variety is good, no egg station, no sunny side up, no omelettes but they have Japanese pan fried egg rolls which is fine for me.After midnight, access to convinent stores needs to walk a little bit, then there is 3 Lawson convinent stores","September 6, 2017","6    The Singulari Hotel & Skyspa At Universal Stud...

From the moment you arrive at the hostel, you are greeted with warm, welcoming and happy faces from those amazing people who work at the hostel. Once you have checked in, you are walked up to your dorm (they also have single sex women dorms if you are travelling as a sole female) and provided with all the essentials - from a toothbrush/paste to towels - you need for a pleasant stay. The dorm we stayed in slept six people, which was absolutely perfect and housed within each capsule bed is a secure safe where you can store any of your possessions. It’s absolutely perfect! Onto the atmosphere. The atmosphere and vibe of the hostel is second to none, and if you are looking to meet lots of different travellers, this hostel is the place for you. As soon as we had checked in, my partner and I were chatting away to the other people who were staying in our dorm, all of who have become lifelong friends.

It's small and quaint and does not offer very much (e.g. pub crawls or a tea workshop or whatever), but what it offers, it does at an extremely high level. The location is great, Dotonbori/Shinsaibashi (arguably the most interesting area of Osaka) is easily reachable on foot in 15 minutes or less. Facilities are top notch; shampoo, conditioner and shower gel are provided in the showers and there are also hair dryers available next to the sinks in the shower area. A small kitchen (with free tea) is provided for those who prefer to cook their own meals rather than go out. The nooks for the beds, which contain a box for your belongings (I think padlocks can be rented at the reception) and a reading light, provide privacy, and the beds themselves are comfortable. The staff is extremely attentive and friendly, always asking about your day and your next plans, providing suggestions (in fluent English) if needed. You can even rent bikes for a small fee to get around.To summarize: Hostel Mitsuwaya is, without a doubt, a place I will visit again should I return to Japan, and it is among the best hostels I've stayed at over ten years of backpacking.","September 24, 2018","7    Hostel Mitsuwaya Osaka

The staff were super friendly and nice, and the hostel was very clean and quiet. It doesn't have an elevator for the upper floors, but the staff will help you carry your luggage if you ask. :) They actually have free breakfast here (tea/coffee and toast) here. Sometimes other hostels advertise free breakfast, but it's not really free. I wish I could have stay a few more days here to check out the local restaurants that were recommended in a little book in their dining area.

377,"This is one of the best hostels I’ve stayed in. It is about 8-10 minutes walk from the Tanimachi 9-chome station. There are other train stations that are a bit farther away but very walkable, which makes this hostel a very good base when exploring Osaka and nearby cities. It is situated in a more quiet part of town but not too far from dotonbori or shinsaibashi (15 mins walk). There are convenience stores nearby and good cafes and restaurants, just ask the front desk! They have very good recommendations. Hostel is very clean. Sleeping area is big enough and offers privacy. Mattress is not so thick, but for me that’s not a problem. There is a small storage area for your valuables (bring your own lock). They have coin operated washing machines, dryers (free detergent). Good sized common area where you can meet other guests. There is free coffee/tea in the kitchen all day, free toast with jam every morning. Most of all, the staff in this place are amazing. They go out of their way to help you and make you feel welcome.

378,"I had a lovely stay at the Hostel Mitsuwaya.I was greeted very kindly by staff every time I came/went and they helped with navigating and recommendations. The location in my mind is perfect. About a 15min walk from Namba- quiet but with enough local charm (Izakayas, udon, market/mall) to keep my interest. The areas to sleep are roomy. The single bay is bigger than any hostel space I’ve stayed in before. The mattress is thin, but I personally had no issue. A roommate had difficulty with the hardness and hostel staff were able to accommodate her by providing a second foam mattress for extra cushion. I’m not sure if this is a normal occurrence or not. Because it’s further from Namba, it didn’t feel like a “party” hostel. That being said, the common space gives a ton of opportunity to lounge around and meet people (and there is beer in the vending machine) and the roof top patio is quite nice to hang out on. Lastly, the hostel design is gorgeous. With All the basics covered (very clean, feel safe, great staff), I would absolutely recommend staying at the Hostel Mitsuwaya.","April 25, 2018","7    Hostel Mitsuwaya Osaka

The staff are incredibly nice and helpful. And just great people to talk to. Good wifi here too. You have all the things you expect, at a really good quality - bathrooms, free breakfast, comfortable areas to relax, a good bed etc. So the overall service and features are pretty great.Location - initially while I was researching and Googling this place, the location kind of worried me - but I found this place easy to find and getting to a from many tourist spots is really easy. I would say around 15-20minutes walking. So if you're sceptical about the location for whatever reason - it's pretty good.There's no bar here as I know come with other hostels but it was never really an issue for me.Sleeping was good but I found the room to be a bit compact at times. Not anything thatt bothered me because I only use it for sleeping - but i know this made affect others.I think overall, this is a hostel that gets right all the neccessities such as great staff, clean bathrroms and resting areas, a comfortable bed and etc. And I haven't even mentioned how cool the place looks.

The hostel is very clean and its modern, contemporary Japanese design creates a fantastic and welcoming vibe. The layout makes it very easy to socialize with guests. I find that other hostel lacks this type of intimacy. In which hostel Mitsuwaya does an excellent job in.We stayed in a mix 6 bedroom dorm and its layout is very spaceous. Floor space might be a problem, however it makes up for it by providing a bunk layout where you have your own personal space which is very helpful. The bunk beds are twin sized. Very spaceous and does the job.Toilets and showers are clean. No issues there.What made the experience that more pleasant were the staff!! Very friendly and always willing to help.

On my arrival, I made a cup of tea which was provided for free by the hostel and kept staring at the cherry blossoms in front of the window. And surprisingly, there's an awesome night cherry blossoms celebration in the neighborhood.I used one day to Osaka Castle where I saw endless cherry blossoms and another day to Shinsaibashi for shopping and eating. Both of these places were just 15 minutes by walk.In a word, according to my experience, I want to highly recommend Mitsuwaya Osaka to people who wants to see cherry blossoms in Osaka!","April 14, 2017","7    Hostel Mitsuwaya Osaka

424,"From the moment I walked into the reception, I had the sinking feeling that the hotel was not going to be good value for the money, and I was proven right.Perhaps I am picky, but the room was incredibly small and the toilet had not been cleaned -there were hairs in the shower and the basin. This is a rarity in Japan - a country renowned for its cleanliness, and it is a disappointment.Service was average, nothing memorable. Lounge-restaurant area feels right out of a backpackers' hostel, and does not feel commensurate to the price point of the property. Property seems understaffed as well.Maybe the hotel fills a market niche, but I will not return.

They provide rice and some traditional japanese foods with high quality, and some breads and salads. I've visited many other hotels around the world, and I can guarantee that this hotel is the best hotel i'vr ever been.Second, they provide free wine, coffee and tea during the day time. They open the cafeteria from 3 to 11 so that the tourists can come down to cafeteria and get some rest. Also the quality of coffee, wine and tea is perfect.Thrid, they provide free shampoo and conditioners and body washers, which are pretty expensive if you buy them outside. It's all free. And they also provide one of my favorite sampoos. Believe me, this hotel provide you with all the best.Lastly, the staffs can speak Korean and english. I had no problem during my stay. They always provide the best things to me. I HAD PERFECT MEMORIES IN HERE. I STRONLY RECOMMEND THIS HOTEL TO ALL THE PEOPLE WHO VISIT OSAKA!!!오시카를 방문하는 여러분!! 이 호텔은 제가 여행하면서 다닌 수많은 호텔중 가장 만족스러운 호텔입니다. 조식도 간단하게 빵만 주는 것이 아니라, 일본식 커리, 오믈렛, 샐러드(각종 과일과 아보카도가 들어간!!!)가 나옵니다. 오후 3시부터 11시까지는 무료 와인 커피 차가 제공되서, 여행하다가 잠깐 들려서 한두잔씩 마시기 좋습니다. 또한 여기있는 직원분들 대부분이 한국말이 가능해서, 제가 여기있는동안 모든 어려움을 해결해주셨습니다. 오사카에 방문한다면 이 호텔에서 꼭 지내세요!!","July 16, 2018","8    Hotel WBF ARTSTAY Namba

442,"o The rooms are pretty large by Japanese standard and offered all amenities a traveller expects in a 5 star hotel. However the interior/decoration of the room does not really make you feel home or cosy. o The bathroom is interesting as it comes with a pretty short bath tub (normal in Japan) and a “6 star toilet” with a heated seat, water jets etc. (often found in Japanese hotels). o Special: the hotel offers a free smart phone which is located in your room. This allows free calls and internet use!o The hotel is very far away from Kansai airport. It takes 1 hour drive early in the morning to reach the airport. The taxi to the airport therefore is costly and was 13.000 yen (107,-- Euro)o I had breakfast and dinner in the hotel. Both were offered as a buffet and tasted good with a relatively wide variety. The price was not cheap but within the price range which is to be expected for such a breakfast/dinner in Japan. o The staff was very friendly and helpfulo Check in is at 3 p.m. only. I could get into my room at 11.00 a.m. but had to pay an “early check in fee” of 4.700 yen (approx. 38,-- Euros). This I find ridiculous bcs. I pay the room for 24 hours but I am allowed to use the room only 21 hours. I informed the receptionist of my even shorter stay of 15 hours only (calculated from 3.00 p.m. to 6.00 a.m. the next morning), but he still charged the “early check in fee”. In this regard the hotel staff is flexible like a railway track and did not make me happy at all (to express it in a very, very polite way!!). I will not stay in this hotel again!","July 6, 2019","9    RIHGA Royal Hotel Osaka

443,"I revisited the hotel after 6 years . Had stayed earlier in 2005 and in 2013. This time I opted for a room in their west wing. The rooms are bigger , brighter with the bath room split in two. The left facing bathroom was a complete loo except the bathtub. The right facing loo had the bathtub and the washbasin console. Different from the usual rooms. In the room we were only given tea satchets(green tea , roast tea and kelp plum tea-more like a clear soup). There were no options for coffee & cream/milk satchets. I had to buy it from the nearby grocery store. The lobby of the hotel is always busy. The restaurant for breakfast is usually full between 7:30 am to 8:30 am and needs increase in capacity. The location of the hotel is perfect with close proximity to the Osaka downtown and station area. There is a shuttle service from the hotel to Osaka station regularly. The grocery stores Seven Eleven and Family mart are about 100 metres from the hotel for grocery requirement. Thereis a fancy shopping centre in the basement of the hotel selling upmarket clother primarily for females.","May 22, 2019","9    RIHGA Royal Hotel Osaka

Staff are very helpful and speak good english and other languages. Wouldnt recommend any of the restaurants for the budget conscious. But lovely food places at the station you can get cheap food. The bakery, Melissa, is fantastic and cheap to buy a pastry or 3 for breakfast. Recommend for couples rather than familys. Lovely toiletries. Reasonable sized rooms and bathrooms.

The most disappointing aspect of this hotel is that even if you are hotel guest, you must pay 3,200 yen (~$30USD) per use of the pool and over 6,000 yen (~$60USD) per use of the gym. Ridiculous and a total rip off. I have never heard of a hotel charge for standard amenities like pool and gym. I would not recommend this hotel.","April 20, 2019","9    RIHGA Royal Hotel Osaka

We called the front desk. Our call was answered by someone who sounded really worried too .. which made us even more worried. We asked about the possiblity of another earthquake.. she cant answer. I asked what should we do.. she sajd.. will get back to us later. After a whileShe called back n told us to go down to the lobby. We went down quickly by the stairs. There were puddles of water. In the midst of all that, i have to compliment one of the hotel staff.. Ms. Buell.. she explained things clearly, helped us with our questions and what should we do next. She made us feel less worried. So we were able to catch a taxi and then shinkansen to tokyo thanks to her aid.

475,"The RIHGA Royal Hotel is an upper-level hotel characterized by friendly service and its location on Nakanoshima (island) in central Osaka. The location is, well... complicated, for several reasons. It's not really close to anything of the note (besides the Convention Center), and although Nakanoshima station, a private rail line, is nearby, it's not the most useful public transportation in Osaka - certainly not as convenient as being close to the metro, which is about a 15-20 minute walk off of the island. If this type of thing doesn't matter for you, this is a better choice. The atmosphere does feel a little more like a business hotel, although I did see a fair amount of families. The neighborhood is prettier at night. There is a handy free shuttle bus that makes the 20-25 minutes drive from JR Osaka Station to the hotel. You should save a map of the pick-up location, as JR Osaka Station is pretty expansive and could be confusing for a first-timer. Once I arrived, the friendly staff quickly greeted me; check-in went smoothly and I had no issues communicating with the front desk. There appeared to be many international guests in the modern, spacious lobby. There are a plethora of shops inside the complex, and they all looked expensive. I found an online deal for my room, which I suspect contributed to it not being too large, but it was comfortable and clean nonetheless. The free wifi worked ok, and the TV wasn't very big, but acceptable. I had a double bed I believe, and I slept alright. The bathroom is the typical standard sized Japanese affair, which was good enough, and the amount of sink space wasn't bad. The housekeeping seemed fine, and the staff responded pretty quickly when I requested an ironing board and iron. Checking out on the last day went without a hitch. Overall, this is a good hotel; due to the location, next time I would probably stay at a hotel closer to the metro, but you could certainly do worse than this place.","July 31, 2017","9    RIHGA Royal Hotel Osaka

478,"We laughed about it after approximately the 10th time we were told ""No.""This is a hotel geared toward Japanese businessmen with large expense accounts.Definitely NOT FOR FAMILIES.Do not bother trying to let children of any age use the pool. First, at check-in, the manager informed us that ""run-of-the-house"" did not include the pool. Later, when I asked the kid at the desk to show me the pool he said, ""NO."" Just ""No."" I asked why not, he said there are no windows. Then he showed me a floor plan of the pool. No problem. Just walk me in. ""No."" Why not? Only pool wear allowed. I went to my room, changed into pool attire, and returned. I said, ""Show me the pool, please."" He huffed and told someone else to show me the pool.Later, I returned with my kids (in pool attire) and offered to pay the approximately US$30 each for them to use the pool. He said ""No."" Why not? They're not old enough. I showed him the same floor plan with rules which clearly stated that my kids were okay to use the pool. He reluctantly let me pay the ridiculous fee to use the pool.Again, he reluctantly allowed my kids to access the pool. My wife suggested we use the nearby spa to get a massage and relax. It was a good idea.Later, we called the front desk to make reservations for dinner at the nearby Italian restaurant. They called back and -- you guessed it, said No.At this point it was a running joke, so we we walked to the restaurant, were told that they had tables available, and enjoyed a most wonderful meal.The reason they get 3 stars is because the room was very spacious and the bell staff were excellent.Don't expect a nice family place.I will post my review of the AMAZING restaurant separately.","May 8, 2017","9    RIHGA Royal Hotel Osaka

481,"The hotel is not particularly well located in Osaka. That said, a train does run to it (but the last stop) and the hotel does provide a very regular and convenient shuttle to Osaka Station.The hotel is stuffed full of restaurants and shops, so one could spend time there, but we ate at cheaper places downtown.The room was small - we knew it would be when we booked - but still comfortable. Would have like a couple more pillows and some coffee in the room, but it was clean and comfortable.Rihga hotels are usually well-priced and have a high quality feel to them, and this one in Osaka fits that.

482,"Wow! This old school Hotel in Osaka is simply wonderful. There are shops of every description, more places to eat that anyone could want, and some truly delightful taverns as well. My Bride and I wandered down to the Cellar Bar for a night cap last night and found ourselves surrounded in a delightful Old English Club atmosphere featuring a piano bar. The prices were quite reasonable. We are planning a wedding here in June so we spent most of yesterday arranging everything from rental Kimonos to western clothing, flowers, meals, invitations, the whole thing in one place.The all day restaurant Remone offers set meals or buffet style meals. You can purchase breakfast coupons very reasonably, The in-house bakery is top notch, two florists, and you can even purchase your new Bentley or Rolls Royce in house if you like. All-in-all this is a wonderful place to stay. The staff is friendly, it is easy to find english speaking staff, or most any language for that matter.","March 26, 2017","9    RIHGA Royal Hotel Osaka

485,"For the price and the title of the hotel, do not expect to be staying in a royal hotel. Ventilation is bad- we came in winter time and the room felt like it was summer. The aircon is actually a heater and the dehumidifier does not do the job. The room is very very outdated and unclean. I found numerous hairs on the floor and even in the bathroom (the short kind!!!) if you plan to take a hot shower or bath, be prepared to feel like your in the sauna as there's no fan. The carpet is rolling up in places, the flat screen is tiny, and the internet constantly drops out. The only saving grace was the staff. If you want something for the year 2017, go elsewhere!

486,"Came to Osaka for a conference and chose the RIHGA primarily for its proximity to the convention center. Room was average-sized but comfortable, so I can't really complain on that front. It's a little warm inside but we found that to be the case all over Japan so just cracked the window the let some air in and humidity out. The taxi stand outside makes for easy transport to various places. The Keihan railway Nakanoshima station is also right outside if you want to negotiate the Osaka subway system—we walked most places.Breakfast buffet is really good but also really expensive (~$50 for two people), so we opted most days to just grab things from joints in the area.

489,"This is by far the best hotel I've stayed at in Osaka. The room was big and comfortable. There's even background music in the room. Clean big super King sized bed with beautiful view at the window. I was most impressed with the laundry service. They were efficient and detail oriented. The wifi was strong and straightforward to log in. Only improvement I guess is that the pillows could have been more firm. All the pillows sank in as soon as we slept on it..Also, the location was mediocre. It is right next to a subway station but you'd have to change a train from Shin-Osaka Station if you came by Shinkansen. Getting around RIHGA is easier by car or taxi if it is nearby. Namba is a 15-20min taxi ride away and should cost you no more than 1600¥. Hotel is great for family holiday and business travelers. Very comfortable stay throughout.

490,"Early check in at noon – ¥8,460 (Over $80.00) was not advised there would be an early check in charge. I arrived from the airport and was told “your room is ready” no extra charge was mentioned, If I had been advised of the charge I would have declined, ¥8,460 is overpriced for a couple hours wait for a regular check in time. This is completely unacceptable.Check out: I was advised by my group organizers I could stay in the room until the time the car came to take me to the airport, 7:30 pm. I made my way to the lobby only to be told my bill would be paid by someone else. I did some checking and confirmed with my group the hotel bill was my responsibility and NOT someone from the group. It seems there was some miscommunication. Finally only at about 7:30 while my car was waiting in front, I was able to convince the front desk staff I was responsible for my bill, not the group. When I saw the bill I was outraged at the early check in charge and the FULL NIGHT charge ¥42,120 for late checkout on Sunday the 18th, neither of which I expected NOR was I directly advised of by the hotel staff. These 2 EXTRA charges were over $500 USD nearly 1/3 of my total stay for 4 nights. This is completely unacceptable. BTW- Weekend rate Sat & Sun nights was nearly 2X the weekday rate.I went to Tokyo that night and had to pay another night hotel in Tokyo, so paid for 2 nights hotel Sunday the 18th.Upon paying I was advised by the staff that after 6pm checkout was a full nights charge. Well had I known I would have and could have been in the lobby to check out at 6 pm no problem! I had packed at noon and I was back in the room 100% ready to go at 6pm just waiting for 7 because the car was coming at 7:30. The point is for a simple miscommunication of the late checkout time and missed by 1 hour, the penalty should not be 1 night stay at over ¥42,000, ($420.00) this is ridiculous. I should have been advised prior to check out time. I had to pay the bill because at this time due to staff not accepting my payment at 7 pm and my car waiting I was going to be late for the airport. Breakfast wait to be seated daily. Worst was Sunday over 30 min. wait. Room keys are made of cheap paper/cardboard material. if you get it a little wet they don't work. I got mine wet... They will attempt to charge you for replacement key if you ask to have it replaced. Don't misplace you CHEAP key or get it WET it will cost you. I wanted to give management the opportunity to fix this issue before posting strong comments on trip advisor and any other social media. I wrote to the GM and I received a reply from the ""front desk"". The reply was they will check the travel agent the booked the group. I will hear back in a week. Also unacceptable, I write the GM with a complaint and the reply form the front desk is they will check with someone else. More miscommunication, I am complaining not the travel agent. No reply from the General Manager.If you stay here beware of hidden fees and overcharges without prior notice! I don't like this kind of service and I will not stay at Rihga Royal properties again.","September 25, 2016","9    RIHGA Royal Hotel Osaka

494,"RIGHA was pretty convenient, with quick and free shuttle bus service to and from Osaka Station, a location near the river, and a convenience store nearby. There's a slightly expensive bakery next to the lobby that sells some interesting items, too. There isn't much else to do in the area, but once you hop the shuttle to the station, Kansai is your oyster.Our room was pretty comfortable, with hookups for charging via USB. The bathtub looked like it had seen better days, though. Our room was small, but cozy.One thing I couldn't figure out was how/why the hotel charged nearly $30 per person for a breakfast buffet; about $20 if you just wanted a continental breakfast. I'd never heard of large hotels doing this to their guests. In addition, if you wanted to swim, you had to pay about $30 per person, too. My wife and I are not big breakfast eaters, so we never partook, but she especially likes swimming and was bummed to find it was ridiculously expensive.","August 22, 2016","9    RIHGA Royal Hotel Osaka

Arriving at KIX airport we chose to take the bus to Osaka Umeda (Hanku) Station approx 45 mins & approx $19 AUD each, then chose to take a taxi to the hotel approx $18 AUD. Painless exercise rather than navigating the unknown subway at night. Come daylight it became apparent what a good location we were at. Turn left from hotel walk short distance to end of street to the start of one of the entrances to Osaka Castle - brilliant. Turn right from hotel & short distance to end of street was the subway, purple line - Tanimachi 4 Chrome Station (T23) to one of the main connecting stations Higashi-Umeda (T20) 10 mins. max. Hotel service was excellent from reception to room cleanliness. Hotel is not new, but is well maintained. Room size was bigger than expected. Only down size was the bed was really hard, but otherwise no issues. Wi-fi operated perfectly in the room. Breakfast was amazing .

The room size of 18 m2 was the largest of the 3 different hotels on this family trip of ours for Osaka and Kyoto. We were given our rooms ahead of the normal check-in time of 2 pm. The hoteI is well located, only 1-2 minutes' walk from the subway station of Tamachiyonchome (Tamachi-4 Chome), 5 minutes' walk to the Osaka Castle and the park and the Osaka Museum of History. The park was beautiful with autumn colours. There are 3 convenience stores around the hotel and a Sukiya restaurant. The hotel provided complimentary self-heating eye masks which my daughters loved. I would recomnend this hotel.","November 24, 2016","10    Hotel the Lutheran

We sent a couple of luggages by courier from another hotel in Osaka a few days before check-in. When we arrived at the hotel, they have prepared the room with our luggages waiting inside. When we had to check out early, the staff stored our luggages in the lobby and was very kind to keep our cheesecakes in the hotel's fridge until we're back in the afternoon. She also helped to book a taxi to airport then carried our luggages to the taxi. Location wise, the hotel is quite convenient. Only 1 minute walk from station exit, and there's a minimart nearby. Osaka castle is just a short walk. However, it's a bit of walk within the station itself from Tanimachiyonchome to Osaka Station, so if travelling with heavy luggages, maybe taxi is more convenient option.

Being japan, of course you have plenty of 7-11 and family marts nearby to grab breakfast. The room was large enough for us to comfortably get a pack and play set up as a crib. If you need to catch an early flight, it's not the most convenient as there is not a direct airport connection - easiest way we found was to take the pink line to Tennoji and catch the airport express to kansai from there (starting at 6:37am).","May 26, 2015","10    Hotel the Lutheran

532,"I chose to stay at Hotel the Lutheran mainly due to the availability at reasonable price when I plan the trip. The hotel location is closed to the tourist spots of Osaka History Museum and Osaka Castle. It is also closed to the headquarters of Osaka police and Osaka government. Though it is just 3 minutes walk from entrance of subway, it will take more than 30 minutes from the hotel to shopping area like Shinsaibashi, Namba, Umeda, etc. If shopping is the first priority, the hotel should not be the preference. However, if Osaka Castle is your main purpose of visiting Osaka, the hotel is a good choice. There are several restaurants and pubs near the hotel. However, after sunset, there are not many people in the streets nearby. It is quite a quiet place. Since it is closed to the headquarters of police, it is safe. The hotel room is small and simple. There is a microwave oven at the ground floor and 2 sets of washing machines and dryers at the underground. The room is equipped with hair-dryers and air cleaner. The free wi-fi is good as a router is located just outside my room. The problem I have with this hotel is the bad smell. The room I stayed is a non-smoking room. However, there was strong smell of smoke in the room. Even the air cleaner was always on, the smell was still there. That is why I do not give a high rating of this hotel.","April 12, 2015","10    Hotel the Lutheran

Non-smoking room does not smell funny. Free wifi that works really well.This hotel has a cafeteria, but we did not dine there. There's an ice machine, trouser press and even coin operated laundry room, which was very convenient.Very near to Osaka Castle and history museum, a good plus. Around the hotel, there are numerous eating places, but being non-japanese speaking, it was quite hard to find one that we could understand. In more touristy areas, they do have english menus, and even if they don't, at least menus with pictures.

Amazing for a Japanese hotel. There is a Subway station within a 2 minute walk of the Hotel as well as a convenience store and places to eat.

539,"Despite of its name this hotel doesn't seem to related to the church. However, I'm sure they are really into charity because they are offering large rooms in a busy Japanese city with very reasonable price. I'm really amazed!The hotel is located in Osaka's business district. It's quiet at night but doesn't feel deserted, for there are several convenience stores and fast food restaurants just around the corner. Hotel the Lutheran is classified as a ""business hotel"" or medium budget hotel. However its room is quite big for that price. Not the spaciousness of a five star hotel. But for a single traveler, it was enough to make me feel a little guilty, considering that I was staying in one of Japan's largest cities. Also the room is clean and cozy, decorated with warm-coloring interior design. I never had chance to complain about it during my four nights of stay. Also the room featured a very large working table. It's even larger than my own desk at work. So it would be convenient if you are here for business. The hotel also features a laundry room with large capacity machines. Usually hotels in Japan only provide small capacity laundry machines for guests to use. They don't function normally if you put more than like two T-shirts in it. But with these large capacity machines i think you can put many clothes in at once, good for a long time traveler.The breakfast is OK for its price. But since it is in a business district, you can easily find some place to eat if you want. The subway entrance is only few steps away. However since Tanimachi line does not pass through Osaka's main tourist districts, you need to transfer at least once to get anywhere except Osaka-Jo castle, which is directly observable from some of the rooms. Overall speaking if you are looking for a high cost-performance hotel and don't mind to be slightly away from the busy districts, this one is definitely recommended.","September 7, 2013","10    Hotel the Lutheran

540,"We stayed here for two nights before we flew home from Kansai. The hotel was pretty good value for what you get. Nothing too spectacular, but everything is well appointed and clean. It is also right next to a metro station on two lines, however finding your way from the metro to the hotel can be a bit tricky as there are no signs point ing to the hotel. (For reference, 1B is the best exit - keep walking straight out 1B and it is about 25m on the left. Exit 1A is also close and has a lift / elevator, if you have luggage).The hotel is built beside / on top of a (presumably Lutheran) church, though the door was locked when we went to look at it, so I cannot confirm whether it is in use.It is walking distance from Osaka castle, which is a nice attraction (if a little fake given that the current structure dates from the 1930s).To get to Kansai Airport we took the metro four stops south to Tennoji and then took a local train to the airport (¥1030, 45 mins, about one train per hour). There was also an express from Tennoji which took 37 mins and cost about ¥2,000, but we had more than 8 minutes to spare so we saved our cash.","July 17, 2013","10    Hotel the Lutheran

541,We had other accommodation booked that fell through 2 weeks prior to our arrival on a very busy weekend in Osaka. The Hotel Lutheran was the only hotel I could find at a reasonable price that I could get 3 nonsmoking rooms at. I usually prefer to stay closer to the action and prior to arriving I was disappointed that I wasn't staying near Namba/Shinshibasi area as previously planned. However the location turned out to be absolutely fine and only a few stops on the metro from Namba or Umeda. The hotel being only 5 min from the castle grounds was nice location for a morning walk/jog. There are also quite a few restaurants around the hotel and we ate in 2 of them during our stay and both were good.

Another bonus for us was the close proximity to the station, just take the B2 exit at the Lutherin Hotel sign and it was just up the street, which is great for us and we didn't know the area. We both agreed that we'd stay at the Lutherin again.","November 26, 2009","10    Hotel the Lutheran

548,"My friend and I enjoyed our stay here. It was inexpensive, clean... your typical Japanese business hotel– which was exactly what we wanted. We had first thought we'd stay in a hostel-type situation, but were able to stay here for less (and it was infinitely nicer). The neighborhood was great. We enjoyed exploring the local izakaya, where foreigners almost never go. There were tons of cute restaurants, cafes and bars in the area that had a great local vibe. And it's about 5 min away from a good subway station, which made travel and day trip convenient.Would definitely say again.","July 4, 2019","11    Hotel WBF Kitasemba West

The hotel is clean and it's facilities are good (guests have use of a smart phone/WiFi device) and the free ramen in the evenings are a winner. It's convenient for Yodaibashi Station which is convenient to get to Kyoto on the Meihan line for day trips. There are a few convenience stores and eateries nearby.

551,"It is easy to reach the hotel via Kansai airport. Just take the Nankai Airport express JPY 920 per person to Tengachaya station. Transfer to subway Sakaisui Line at K20 station (about 10 mins) and get off at Kitahama Station Exit 6 where lifts are available at this station which is especially useful if you have huge luggage. It's about 10 mins walk to the hotel from the station. The entire journey takes about 1.5 hours. The room is clean with slippers, coffee/tea coupled with electric kettle and bathroom amenities provided. However, I'm quite disappointed with the housekeeping as they do not wash the coffee cups when you used it. Also, my friend actually stain the bedroom slippers but they didn't even change it. The room is so small that I couldn't even lay down my luggage . Well, they do provide free ramen every night from 9.30 - 10.30 pm. There are also coin laundry at 300 Yen and dryer at 300 Yen but I rather go the public laundry shop that is located 2 min away from the hotel since you don't have to queue. It cost 500 Yen to wash 10kg of clothes and 100 Yen for every 10 mins of drying. Check-in time is 3 pm and check out time is 10 am and if you wish to extend, you need to pay extra.

554,"It was my first time staying in this hotel in Nov 2018. Initially we were attracted by this hotel given it was a chain hotel and newly opened in 2018, yet after the experience we had with our stay in this hotel, we definitely had changed our mind. This was quite normal to put personal care items including facial cleanser, toothbrush kit etc (which were all our newly opened ones) in the washroom as we didnt prefer to use hotel supplied ones. After the first day hotel room cleaning service, unfortunately we could not find back all our personal belongings which were initially placed in the washroom. It was a very inconvenient experience to us that we lost the personal care items on first day of travel given shops all closed when we realised we lost them and couldnt enjoy our stay in this hotel. On same day night, we reflected our concern to the hotel staff to investigate the issue we lost our personal belongings in the washroom. However, not all staff could understand English well and it seemed that they were quite green in handling guests enquires/ resolving guest problems. After several days of our follow up with the hotel staff, the hotel manager just reverted a comment that the cleaning staff would not throw away personal belongings of the guests and they showed no sincerity in following up our issue any more. After this experience, we had to keep the washroom empty with our things everyday to avoid losing our personal things anymore. Hence better take our experience as a reference when choosing this hotel. We would not choose this hotel chain anymore in the future after this unhappy experience.","December 1, 2018","11    Hotel WBF Kitasemba West

While it does not cater to foreign tourists, it does provide for a comfortable and pleasant stay. Breakfast is free. They serve mostly bread and danish in small portions, cereals, and yogurt. Coffee is available the whole day. The rooms are clean and just the right size. However, it’s quite a long walk to the nearest subway and bus stations and to shopping malls. But service is efficient. Staff is not the friendliest I’ve encountered but helpful; the lady at the front desk (Kinichi?) helped us a ton on the day we checked out.

We walked everywhere and took train when necessary. Definitely recommend.","October 15, 2018","12    Arietta Hotel Osaka

Shampoo and bath gel did not cause allergy. Wifi free and good. Walkable distance to both Hommachi and Sakisuji Hommachi Station. Staff attitude good. Breakfast free but limited choice.

595,"This was the first hotel we stayed at on our trip around Japan. The hotel itself is located between Namba and Umeda - we walked from Namba station which took about 15/20 mins. The nearest tube is Hommachi station and takes about 5 mins costing under 200 yen. The hotel is very compact with the reception area also being the breakfast buffet area. We arrived at 10am hoping to check in early (say 1pm) but they were unable to help us and insisted that 3pm is the earliest we could check in. This wasn't what we wanted to hear after a 13 hour flight and in need of a quick nap. Most hotels in Japan stuck strictly to the check in times during our visit. The room we got was quite nice and averagely sized. It was clean and was a non smoking room. The breakfast buffet was terrible - it was hot drinks, yogurts, fruit and pastries. Nothing special and most of it completely average. It was super busy as the reception area doubled as a breakfast area. Overall a good location for most sites (20 min walk to Osaka castle) and well connected on the subway but rooms and service average.","April 24, 2017","12    Arietta Hotel Osaka

598,"This hotel was quietly tucked away from the mai. Street just a short walk from the subway station. It's very well located in Osaka and surrounded by a lot of good Izakayas. We were warmly welcomed upon arriving and quickly checked in.The beds are certainly firm but still got a good night's sleep. The room wasn't giant but that's to be expected in Japan. What was surprisingly big was the bathroom. Which came with a huge bath tub and some really good provided amenities. The lobby also had a few free products as well if you had forgotten your comb or other feminine items. The breakfast was suitable. It's not some Grand buffet but it has a good selection of pasties and some cereal, yogurt, and salad. Coffee, tea and juice were also available. One of my favorite things was the green tea bread. All in all for an extremely reasonable price this hotel is great. I will warn those coming from North American, you may want to get the upgraded room with the larger bed. The standard bed will likely be a little small for you. Thank you to the staff of the Arietta for making the stay most pleasant.","January 11, 2017","12    Arietta Hotel Osaka

Nice touches in the room include anti-fog bathroom mirrors, heated toilet seat and a full-size bathtub.

Value-for-money choice for (1) its proximity to Honmachi station (exit 1), (2) its location at the one end of Shinsaibashi shopping street, which takes you to Shinsaibashi in 10 minutes on foot with hundreds of shops along both sides of the street, (3) reasonably big room with large bathroom, (4) plenty of one-seater sofas and space in the lobby for you to wait for friends and repack your luggage after final shopping, (4) simple energy-charging breakfast served from 630 to 930, and (5) efficient check-in and -out.

They were happy to store our suitcase as we broke our 2 night stay with a night in Hiroshima in between. The location was probably the wrong choice for us as it is in a business area and we would have had to take a subway to get anywhere.

Despite the slight oddness, we quite enjoyed breakfast in the comfortable lobby. There is also a self-serve laundry facility. The location was excellent, two blocks from the subway. As we learnt, it makes a huge difference which subway exit you take from the station, so do check for the hotel on the area map in the subway. We seemed to be only two or three subway stops from any place we wanted to go in Osaka, so it was perfectly located. We also walked to restaurants within ten blocks of the hotel.The only problem with the hotel was that there were no closets or even drawers, only two wall hooks, so we couldn’t unpack.

The bus drops you at Hotel Hankyu International, and you can take the subway 2 stops to the metro stop near the hotel - after that it was a 2 minute walk. The sidewalks even have ramps to help with your bags!-Free breakfast (pastries, juice, bananas, etc)-Very charming appearance with greenery and climbing vines-Very easy walk to Osaka Castle, the aquarium, etc.-Great rate!-Windows in the room actually opened!-Nice amenities in case you forgot your toothbrush, razor, etc.-Bathroom was really quite large but had the pocket doors typical in Japan. Cons:-As with all rooms in Japan, the room was very small. There wasn't much room to maneuver-Beds were rock hard, but again, this was the case everywhere in Japan-Keys must be turned into the desk if you leave the hotel to sight see, eat, etc.I think this hotel was great for a few nights but I think the tight space and the hard bed would get to me after a while.

If you are a good walker, you can walk along Shinsaibashi to Dotonburi in about an hour. Hotel staff are friendly, helpful and can speak good enough English to serve you. The room is sizable for Japanese business hotel's standard. It's clean and well equipped. You can choose non- smoking floor as well. Breakfast is strictly continental but the croissant and pie are nice. I stayed here with my family and we have a good time. If you are planning to visit Osaka, this hotel should be one of your option. ","July 13, 2014","12    Arietta Hotel Osaka

626,"We stayed in this hotel for 8 nights with our 6 month old baby and it was very good. The location, Honmachi is excellent, halfway between the two main districts of Namba and Umeda, which meant we could get to both easily. Travelling with a baby meant that sometimes we would walk to our destination and then catch the subway back (or vice versa), and being in this location made it easy to do this. Honmachi is a business district, so relatively quiet compared to Namba and Umeda, which was well suited for us and baby. One Saturday evening we went out to an izakaya and it was actually empty because it was the weekend, so baby was able to join us and relax without getting over stimulated by noise and disturbed by cigarette smoke.The rooms are spotless and modern, with super fast WiFi. We had a standard single room, so it was very small, but had a double bed so find for a couple. In hindsight, we would probably take a twin room, for the extra bed and the extra space. In the single room, it was tough to find somewhere to sit when baby was taking a nap and having a bigger room would most certainly have helped. Special mention of Pola toiletries in the bathroom, which is a treat.Breakfast was also included. It was just simple and basic - breads, fruit, yoghurt, coffee, juice. But it was delicious and sufficient. Those that know Japan, know that is actually difficult to find breakfast, so this made it easy, and gave you a kickstart to the day. Overall, I have no qualms about staying here again or recommending it to others.","June 8, 2014","12    Arietta Hotel Osaka

627,"I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights of a quick Osaka-Kyoto trip with my friends. We are very pleased with the room and mostly the spacious bathroom which consists of separate bathtub and shower. Pretty amazing compare to small hotel room which is common in Japan. The location is great since it is very near to the Hommachi subway station. Just a little tips to find the location from the subway station, take the 3rd Exit, turn right and go straight until you see the first alley, turn right again and just go straight, you will find the hotel pretty soon. There are lots of convenience store along the way to the hotel as well which is quite handy if you wish to buy water or small food such as onigiri, sandwich, etc.They provide many amenities such as shower cap, hair band, comb, etc. They also provide free breakfast as well. Most important thing that makes me love this hotel even more is that they found and kept my mobile phone once I left it in my room once I checked out from the hotel. Appreciate it so much.I recommend this hotel to everyone and probably will stay here again if I ever visit Osaka in the near future.","June 3, 2014","12    Arietta Hotel Osaka

628,"Hotel is no doubt very conveniently located to Hommachi subway station, about 3mins walk, but it is sort of in the middle of a business area. And since we planned a lot of side trips which required us to switch to JR or Kintetsu trains from either Namba or Umeda, it became a bit pricey towards the end (a one-way trip to Namba was already 180 yen).Nonetheless, the other amenities were great. We were placed on the top floor which was great. Rooms were much bigger than those we stayed at in Tokyo and the toilets were very spacious for Japanese standards. Staff were helpful but spoke very limited English (only one girl who helped check us in had good English). We didn't try the breakfast since it was simple bread and cereal so we had rather saved our stomachs for something else. Overall, our 6-day stay at Arietta was quite enjoyable.","May 7, 2014","12    Arietta Hotel Osaka

632,"Conveniently located just above Hommachi Station, which allows you to easily access almost most tourists' spots in the city. Take Exit 1 and turn left, and you will see it on your right of the 2nd block. It's quiet at night as it's in commercial area. What excited me is how close it is to Akachan - an ideal place to do shopping for infants and kids, which is within 5 minutes' walk. After shopping you don't have to carry your stuff a long way back to your room. Cons: (1) The bed was not soft enough for us to get deep sleep. (2) The adapter/sockets were all out. They seem to provide a small number of socket adaptors for borrowing. You should get yours ready. Other major concerns are discussed in other reviews and I'm not repeating.","January 5, 2014","12    Arietta Hotel Osaka

633,"My husband and I stayed at the Arietta Hotel after a stay in Kyoto. We stayed for 3 nights and had perfectly lovely stay. The hotel is pretty simple, and breakfast is okay with bread, pastries and yogurt, so it meets all of your basic needs. The hotel does NOT have wifi, but if you bring your laptop, it does have connection in the room for internet, which is helpful. There is also an area in the lobby with computers if you need to look anything up, which is great too.My only complaint is that the pillows were the hardest thing I have every experienced. The best way to put it was like it was sleeping on a sack of flour, which was not comfortable at all. I knew the mattresses would always be firm (this is Japan), but the pillows threw me off a lot-make sure to bring your own when you travel here.Make it a point to also stop by the St. Regis Bar, it's right down the street. A BEAUTIFUL way to indulge!","January 1, 2014","12    Arietta Hotel Osaka

Very little noise from outside however. Staff were delightful... and very patient with the Englishman who spoke very little Japanese. Nothing was too much bother. Breakfasts were limited but absolutely fine. Fresh fruit; juices; pastries etc. The rooms were spotlessly clean. No complaints at all about our time there.

641,"The Arietta is really well located, very close to Exit 1 of the Hommachi station on the Midosuji line. There are plenty of places to eat close by, and there is also a Mini Stop (convenience store) just down the road. The staff are friendly and helpful, and the light breakfast provided in the large lobby is great.We were fairly happy with the room. While on the small side by Western standards (there was barely enough room for our bags and the bed), it was nicely appointed and contained everything we needed for our stay. There were also items that reception can loan you, such as nail clippers and chargers. We are pretty hard to impress in terms of room cleanliness, but we were super impressed with the Arietta on this aspect. It was spotlessly clean on arrival, and returned it to this state every time they serviced the room. The bathroom was fairly spacious on comparison to the room, and included a bath and a toilet with many electronic functions ('music', bidet, etc). The toiletries provided were lovely as well.We only had two complaints about the Arietta: firstly, the bed was VERY hard. My husband eloquently described the pillows as sleeping on a sack of sand. Secondly, the size of the rooms. Being 'Westerners', we often felt like Gulliver in Lilliput. Overall, however, it is a great hotel and location for the price.","December 25, 2012","12    Arietta Hotel Osaka

One small issue I had was the staff was not very good in English thus my email correspondence with them to find the hotel was difficult. But for the enjoyment I had in this hotel, that wasn't a big issue. Thank God for google maps and friendly Japanese. Will try their other outlets in other prefectures next time.

656,"City Plaza Hotel, OsakaOK, after a week in Kyoto, I was back to Osaka. For a bit longer than one night this time.It is 14 storeys, modern hotel with the top 2 floors looking like an UFO has just landed on top of the building. (Do not confuse with Singapore).It is rather interesting place: located in Chuo – financial district and tourist areas – it is as modern as weird. In the amusing, positive way.Location suited me fine, as it is away from Namba, Minami and Amerikamura, which are just over – rated, proverbial Tourist Traps.City Plaza is enormous; it has 200 rooms and most of them are single or twin. The UFO on the top contains an Onsen (Real One = with real minerals), also an outdoors Communal Bath and beauty Spa.There is also ‘OE’ – Japanese Restaurant, ‘Rivage’ – something European sounding and Sake Bar.No comments as I hardly ever use Hotel provided food and drinks.There is ‘Tully’s Café’ at the Lobby; they make very good coffee and serve strange food as Hot Dogs with Bolognese topping and other gems like that. Surprisingly good and the service is great.Also, this is the only place at the whole complex, where you can smoke outside.About the rooms > Japanese descriptions are always rather confusing, therefore – their range starts from: Standard Single =16 square meters, Deluxe Single = 18 square meters, Double= = 20 … and it goes up to Plaza Suite = 53 square meters. Mind boggling.I stayed at the Double 20 (I think) and it was very comfortable and spacious for Japanese standards.There is a lot of green feature walls in the rooms and dimmed light. You can open windows a bit if you wish. All pretty tasteful.Bathrooms? The same as everywhere else: small, but functional and well equipped with all you need. The foyers on various floors have similar, subdued/greenish décor and they also play some version of Whale Songs for your comfort. Cute. They also have those see-through, futuristic elevators, where you can watch the mechanism work before your mosaicked and mirrored box arrives. Fun.The weird thing is the actual entrance to the hotel: it is very wide and long and decorate with kitschy flowers and garlands. Apparently, this is a popular place for Wedding Receptions, so there is even a Booking office with endless videos of happy couples streaming endlessly. Funny, but not offensive.Front Desk > the same again: they are super friendly, but language difficulties.I have absolutely no problem with it as it is I who visits their country, therefore it is my duty to learn few words, no? Which I did, but obviously not enough.Besides; English is my third language, so all my support goes to those nice people who do their best.Plus, we all have our APPS, no?Back to location: it is NOT in the tourist hot spot, but only 15 minutes’ walk to Osakajo > 16th.century Castle with grounds surrounding that will blow up your minds.Across the intersection from that is Osaka Museum of History: 10 floors super modern building that takes you through the volatile story of this town. Not to be missed.OH! Transport!There is a Subway on every corner. Literally. The hotel will supply you with good maps and iffy directions every time you need to get somewhere. Taxis are cheap.If you need to return to Kix; you can catch the train or bus to Namba Central and then get the Shuttle to the Airport. But it is rather hard to find the Shuttle Terminal over there, as it is a bit removed and on the first floor of some building with no signs in English. Abbreviations only.So, I got the City Plaza Hotel to order me a taxi. It is only $1400 Yen or so and no need to drag your stupid bags around asking for directions. Delivered @ the right escalator; the ticket to Kansai costs a bit more than the taxi = 1500 Yen and the trip takes about 50 minutes. Depending on traffic. So, good Hotel; not in the middle of all the tourist madness but not far away either.Highly recommended unless u can stay @ the Ritz.I like Osaka very much, but as there are some unreal, modern buildings that look like large scale sculptures – it could be anywhere. I am sure it does have a soul, but I had not enough time to find it.","November 3, 2018","14    City Plaza Osaka

657,"I liked this hotel, although don't expect too much English to be spoken. It was a good value, and a somewhat larger room than expected for the price. It is a little inconvenient for public transport, as it is a good 7 to 10 minutes walk to a subway station. There are, however, 3 different lines less than 10 minutes walk away, so that makes up for a bit of a walk. That also makes it a little inconvenient getting to/from the airport, as a taxi will likely be needed to get to whatever station the airport train drops you off at. Namba station is likely the closest, then a taxi cost maybe $14 one way, but the savings compared to hotels close to Namba or Osaka Station will quickly pay for itself right away, as this hotel is a good 30% cheaper.I stayed here because this hotel has an authentic and REAL natural hot springs ONSEN on the roof. It is not simply hot tap water, it is actual mineral water pumped up from the ground. It will have a slight sulfer smell up there, so you know it is real. They have both indoor and outdoor baths. Men and women are separated, and it is required to bath in the nude, in the Japanese tradition. It is incredibly soothing and relaxing. They are open I think from 7 am to midnight, with some closure during the middle of the day. One thing that is truly spectacular in this hotel is they have a few rooms, I think 10 total, where you can have the genuine hot springs water delivered right to your private bathtub, in your room. These are technically handicapped rooms, but you can enjoy the ONSEN experience in the privacy of your room, 24 hours a day. These rooms are an incredible value for the experience you get. This type of room is a true rarity in the world, especially inside a large city, at a reasonable price. There is a 7-11 convenience store at the hotel entrance, and the food in the restaurant was great, and the buffet a great value...both western and Japanese food.","July 1, 2018","14    City Plaza Osaka

668,"My sister and I stayed here as part of a group.Location:- it is about 5 mins walk from the Sakaisuji Hommachi subway station (not to be confused with Hommachi station)- although we were near some major expressways (seen from our 9th floor room), noise wasn't an issue- there is a 24h convenience store outside the hotel (great for snacks and quick lunches)- the hotel hosts many wedding functions so the lobby level is full of displays- it's about 5-10min walk to Osaka Castle- the rest of Osaka sightseeing can be seen by taking the subway eg. Dotonbori district- it's strange but there is a 1am curfew (not that we were out that late, but there were warnings in the room)Amenities:- breakfast was a great spread of Asian and Western items (eggs, sausages, rice porridge, noodles, pickles, fruit, salads, pastries)- we did not visit the gym or onsen, but many of our friends enjoyed the onsenRoom:- we were lucky to have a very large and spacious room, but some of our friends didn't seem to fare as well (from their descriptions of the amount of space around the bed) - we had a small sofa and table, a separate desk for working, and the toilet was separate to the shower- climate control worked well- free wifi- there was also a large wardrobe with iron, safe, slippers, and a small bar fridge with tea making facilities- the room was quiet and comfortable with plenty of lightingBathroom:- the shower/bath was separated by a door from the sink and make up mirror... it didn't seem to make much sense taking a shower by moving the nozzle to point over the bath because it just sprayed everywhere. However the design of the separate room appears to be that you are supposed to shower on the FLOOR in this separate room (and take a bath in the bath). I couldn't get used to this, so I still showered in the bath... but be prepared for wet floors! This doesn't matter so much because the sink is outside, and the toilet is somewhere else, but it's still pretty weird- there was a laundry line inside also- it was nice to have a small chair and table with the make-up mirror- the toilet was across from the shower room, and had an individual sink (however there was no soap here, so it was a bit annoying to walk across to the other sink to use the soap)Overall, having stayed at two ryokans and sleeping on tatami mats on the floor in Tokyo and Kyoto, it was nice to come back to a Western-style room with comfortable beds!","March 11, 2016","14    City Plaza Osaka

Its amenities are somewhere between ""business hotel"" and full service hotel. The rooms are somewhat spartan, but vey efficiently designed.

City Plaza Osaka is a modern hotel with all comfort one can expect from a 4 star hotel. Room is small and compact with a small double bed which is suitable for asian couple. We find it a snug to share a small bed but its okay for us. The room has a big window and this help brighten up the small compact room. I find the room very clean and comfortable.Room has LCD TV, fridge with free mineral water, water boiler with free tea, hairdryer, a humidifier, and even a massage chair ! Pajamas and slippers are provided too. Bathroom is big in relation to the size of the room and toiletries are provided too.Location wise is okay as you are a short subway ride from the bustling namba area. There arent many dining options around the hotel, so we ended up going to namba for food every night.The best thing about this hotel is the spa on the top floor which is free to hotel guests.

We couldn’t sleep well because of the heat and humidity. We will not be staying here again.

694,"As a westerner (USA) it is a bit of an adjustment to stay in small, Japanese hotels. That said, we stayed in other similarly priced hotels and found that while small, their rooms were of much better design than the WBF Namba Kuromon. Our double room was very tight and uncomfortable due to poor design (and we're both small people). The Namba Kuromon seemed to be a new hotel made cheaply and quickly. For example, we called our bathroom the ""trailer"" because it felt like an afterthought in the room. You had to step up to enter the bathroom and once inside it, it felt very temporary. We also got unlucky and had a room with a depressing view and a neighboring pair of rooms that had a loud party our first night. However, those last two things could really happen anywhere. In addition to the our issues with the hotel itself, we wish we had stayed further from the Dotonbori. It is very, very touristy and each meal we had within a 5-10 block radius felt lackluster and sometimes predatory (table charge of $3 per person, food from a fridge/freezer). In our opinion, Osaka's charms are not in this neighborhood -- which is better suited for a quick walk through to see the lights and crush of people. We kept finding ourselves wanting to get as far away from the hotel as possible to sightsee, eat, etc. Not a great setup. Overall, we just found the neighborhood too hectic and dirty and the room too small and poorly designed to comfortably rest or relax during the day or at night, which is a really key part of travel. I think we could easily have found a better value.","June 26, 2019","17    Hotel WBF Namba Kuromon

695,"The hotel has an excellent location! You can reach the subway station within a minute by foot, and the famous Dotonbori is just a 7 minute walk away. Also, the famous Kuromon Ichiba Market is just across the street, and the shopping mall Namba Parks is a 10 minute walk . A long the way to the mall, you’ll walk past several streets that is full of great japanese resturants! The hotel room was nice too, but maybe a bit small for two persons with a big suitcase each. But hey, it’s Japan, and we made it work! No biggie. The minus though was that when we checked in we were recommended to go see their rooftop bar with the nice view, but when we went up that same night, the rooftop was only for lounge guests. That was a bit disappointing. But besides that, we had a great stay at this hotel!","June 24, 2019","17    Hotel WBF Namba Kuromon

The staff were friendly and helpful.The room was fairly small, but well designed and had most things you need e.g a fridge and a safe.

The best feature was a free smart phone which we could take out with us - ideal for checking things online (maps, train times etc) when exploring Osaka and beyond, without having to worry about WiFi or charges.The hotel also has a Sky Lounge which, for a small fee, residents and guests can spend the evening in - drinking and eating with no further charges.I would recommend this hotel, and would certainly check out their other hotels in Japan.","May 17, 2019","17    Hotel WBF Namba Kuromon

702,"Brand new modern and stylish hotel in a very central location in Namba area. Closest station is Nipponbashi but more convenient is Namba Station which is either a 1-stop subway or 10-15 walk away (via underground passageway). Very close to lots of restaurants and shops as well as Dotonbori street and canal. On the positive side: location is the main draw. Staff are friendly. Rooms are a good size (by Japanese standards), and rooms provide kettle, fridge, pyjamas and a mobile phone with data- - which is a great benefit. Free hot coffee machine in the lobby.On the slightly negative side: Cleanliness could be slightly improved (on more than one occasion I found hairs that were not mine in the bathroom and on the bed). Storage isn't great; there is no drawer space and only one small coat rack with 4 hangers. Also, there is no bedside table or nightstand which is a bit odd because is just an an empty space between the two beds which would perfectly fit one. Day or night the lobby was always filled with noisy guests just hanging around. Not sure for what reason. They will store your luggage but keep in mind it's not kept secure, so all the luggage just stays in the lobby.","April 23, 2019","17    Hotel WBF Namba Kuromon

Many restaurants/Dotombori market within walking distance and Nippombashi Station 5 mins away.Hotel provides free tea and coffee from 6am-12am and a WIDE selection of different shampoo and conditioners, all in the lobby (free to use). Breakfast wasn’t as great as expected after reading other reviews, but still has a nice view from the 15th floor.Rooms were smaller than expected and struggled to walk around after opening 2 medium-large sized suitcases. Bathroom was also small but still managed to fit a bathtub.CLEANING has to improve!! Rooms were very dusty, above the headboard had a layer of dust which my sister had to wipe down herself and the pyjamas/bed sheets had strands of hair from previous guests. Pillows were too hard for my liking but can choose more from the pillow menu provided.Air conditioner made a lot of noise, even when not in use. Upon arrival, rooms were very hot and stuffy so I decided to switch on the AC. Then realised it was on heat mode and when I asked staff at lobby to change it to cool mode, they said it was centrally controlled by them but insisted we open a small window instead. A day prior to checking out, they finally changed the AC to cool mode, probably from all the guests’ complaints.Overall was a decent stay here. Staff were friendly-ish and the hotel in general was very clean and modern. Handy phone was provided with 4G unlimited internet and 30 mins of free hotspot (or could pay for 24hrs). Wifi in hotel rooms - very strong + 5G.

Thats the strangest thing I’ve ever heard and when I ask for the hotel manager they say its Sunday so theres no manager. In hotel business there are no Sundays , you have to have one senior authority on duty every day and in a country like Japan thats so advanced I don’t understand how I’m facing such a problem that I’m awake in the middle of the night because I’m suffocation cause of the heat that too when Its winter.

The room was not soundproof at all, I could hear people in the halls as well as my neighbours. I heard conversations a family had with their child who was unwilling to take a bath. It wasn't a cheap stay either which is why i ranked it average. There also was no free water given in the room which was a perk I got at APA hotels in other parts of Japan.

Although the subway is a bit further away but I got used to it. This might be a problem or tiring for older folks but when travelling in Japan there is a lot of walking.I got a single room which is sufficient and the standard size of any Japanese hotel. The luggage stand was big enough for my luggage and there are drawers to keep my shopping/stuff away so the room do not look to untidy.Staff were friendly and greet every guest that return or leaving the hotel. My check-in & check-out was also very prompt and easy.I didn't book the room with breakfast so cannot comment on the breakfast.

On the day of check-out, they keep my luggage and I picked it up later in the day when I leave for the airport (so I think that is quite standard service).","October 2, 2018","18    Sarasa Hotel Namba

Well, here it goes.We opted for a Japanese-western room to cater to 3 adults and a child. Hotel room was ready when we checked in around 1 pm although the indicated time was 3pm. Thankful for that and rare in Japan!Room was immaculately tidy with 2 western beds and 2 beds on tatami ready. Am sure it can sleep 2 more pax if needed. There was also a couch, coffee table and dining/tea table. Room was super huge by Japanese standard for the price. Toiletries amenities were adequate throughout our 4 night's stay. Toilet and shower are separate areas.Very near to Namba station and away from the main hustle and bustle of Osaka which could be too overwhelming for some. Near to a handful of convenience shops and eateries. 5 mins to Kuromon Market for fresh seafood. Anime fans will love this area as it's surrounded by anime-related shops.Just one grouse. No place to hang towel and clothes when taking a shower.Definitely opt for this hotel again if coming back to Osaka.","January 21, 2018","18    Sarasa Hotel Namba

794,"After having stayed in super cram hotels in the Shinsaibashi district, I'm glad to have found this hotel! It's easily accessible from the Kansai Airport (even if you arrive on the SQ night flight) - just take the Nankai train direct to Namba station. Once you exit from the Shinkansen tracks (you will be on 3rd floor), look for the escalators or lift to take you to 1st floor. Then look for Takashimaya or the East exit towards Den Den town (it's quite a small exit so do look out for it!) Cross the traffic light and there are a few ways that you can walk towards the hotel. You can look for SEGA down the road and walk straight past the carpark, the hotel just opposite this white unique looking building (some national archives) - inside the sheltered walkway along the shop houses! There's a conbini just across the cross junction so it's pretty convenient and there are many other shops just down the road to Namba station. I absolutely adore the wooden floors !! Instead of the carpeted floors inside the rooms which traps dust, these floors are much better and makes you feel more at home! :) Will definitely be back when I visit Osaka!

805,"Getting around in Osaka isnt as easy as in Tokyo, good thing Sarasa is easy to find. From airport, take Nankai Namba Aiports express train, stop at Namba. Then walk about 350mtr or follow Google Map, Sarasa Nipponbashi should be there. The hotel is located in the heart of Den Den town, the anime culture area. Also close to Namba area, the second most crowded area in Osaka after Umeda/Osaka. Near the hotel there are Namba Parks and Namba City with many shops. Kuromon market or the fish market is also very close by. If you wonder why they call it Sarasa Nipponbashi, its because you can also get off at Nipponbashi Station which is 1 stop before Namba Station.When we reach the hotel, it was late in the afternoon. Greeted by the GM Mr. Tetsuya Nunoi, who is very nice and fast in handling our rooms. The rooms were roomy, we get the double bed with sofa bed for our family. It was clean and somehow advanced. USB plug was on the wall, 2 at the desk, and 2 at bedside. Make it easy to recharge your gadget.. I like it. The bed was nice and simple. The AC is motion activated so you wont get too warm or too cold when you sleep. Amenities was allright, and there are extre sink outside the bathroom (something you dont see at other hotel), so dont have to wait if the loo is taken.Too bad for the TV channel with only 10 channels available, no cable yet since this is newly open establishment.Breakfast was surprise because I thought it would be too simple. Yes it was simple, yet it was nice. A combination of western and japanese breakfast, with great japanese style black cofee and tea. The only downside is the tray and the plastic plates that they use is somehow too simple. The tray was also slippery, so watch out when you tilt it, the plate might fall off. Overall, I am happy with the breakfastWhat makes this hotel more convenient was the laundry and dryer machine available on 2nd floor. This made us easier since did have a long stay at this hotel. There are also plenty of food around the hotel, easy for you to try traditional japanese food, not mall food. In short, I would return to Sarasa again when I visit Osaka next time. With a short walk from the station, you can check in to a nice, simple and yet comvenient hotel to stay. I would recommend it for a family with either short or long stay in Osaka.","December 26, 2016","18    Sarasa Hotel Namba

The hotel is just one min away.Foods and small supermarkets/stores everywhere along the way.We will return if the price is kept low (we spent ard 140 SGD a night).

The staff and cleaners are very efficient and extremely polite as the culture of Japan dictates. The breakfast is substantial but I really missed the fruits as the fruits are of the frozen variety and a small bowl where after you scooped, you seem to have taken all the fruit! What I find really uncomfortable is that the cooked eggs are cold (from the fridge)!! I have to soak them in hot water or soup so as not to eat chilled cold eggs. Location wise, this hotel is strategically placed - there is a huge supermarket nearby, food streets just a few minutes walk and the Railway Station is 10 mins. The underground station is 5 mins.

Of course, room size is not that big but a standard room is manageable for 2 adults. Nice bathroom. My husband and I slept comfortably for the whole duration of our stay - 5 nights! Their breakfast also is not that pricey and has good selection of both local & Western food. We enjoyed the breakfasts we had and their staff as well were pleasant to deal with - very helpful.

We were told that if we would opt for take out breakfast we would be given a fruit cake and non other. Well what to do ,so we had to wait until the restaurant opened at 6am and eat with a great sense of urgency as our pick up was at 6:30am. The spread was very nice but one cannot truly appreciate it given less than 30mins to enjoy it. The rooms are cute but functional , the coffee in a drip bag was splendid .

The breakfast here is also very nice. It provide a variety of food choice which includes local cuisine and western breakfast. I love the hot spring egg and the milk Motcha so much.

If you are taking the train there, exit from Exit 1 of the station, do a 180 turn at the top of the stairs and walk straight, the main road should be on your left as you walk.","September 7, 2016","19    Richmond Hotel Namba Daikokucho

843,"Stayed here for 4 nights as part of my Japan holiday after staying in Tokyo and being a student, was a chosen for the price of the hotel. From the looks of it hotel is newly built and very modern.Location: Great location, 3-4 minutes walk from Daikkucho station which is where the main midosouji line is (red line) which stops at the main areas, Shinshaibashi, Namba/osaka station, and Shin osaka ect.. so getting to these places is cheap and easy! Theres a massive supermarket called life behind the petrol station opposite the main road of the hotel which we missed on the first 3 days and only found on the last day which is a bugger. Its called Life and has a flower logo outside so dont miss it! 10 minute walk to the bottom of the namba shopping area, if you keep on walking north of the hotel main road youll come across a lot of shopping areas and eventually end up in shinsaibashi. Room: Very clean and well equipped with kettle, tea, toiletries, fridge, large bath and shower, spacious room for a budget, very comfortable bed. Facilities: Hotel has laundry and dryer facilities which is great. Didnt try the breakfast here since theres a lot of food places nearby but its a buffet breakfast which looked pretty nice. Overall: Very nice, clean hotel with location as its best point. Im very picky about hotels since my standards are extremely high and this hotel met my standards. Good for budget travellers in terms of space in the room and good amenities. Would definitly recommend to people staying in Osaka.","June 25, 2016","19    Richmond Hotel Namba Daikokucho

851,"Been a fan of this chain since I stayed in one of their properties in Matsumoto. This Osaka hotel did not disappoint as well. The rooms are tiny- barely enough space to move around- but are clean and functional. The toilet is one of those modular installations quiet common in Japanese hotels. The water pressure jetting from the shower is particularly commendable (try it). Had breakfast at the hotel for each of the 5 nights at the hotel- I never got tired of the selection.Location wise, the hotel is a stone's throw from Daikokucho station, which is just one station from Namba along the Mido-Suji subway line. Alternatively, its about a fifteen minute walk to the Dotonbori area. Umeda station is about ten min away by rail.Directions to the hotel from Kansai:(1) Take the Haruka to Tennoji Station(2) Go on the Mido-Suji subway line on the direction of Umeda(3) Disembark at Daikokucho Station, leave from Exit 1 (no lifts in sight)(4) Walk along the street towards Pachinko and Sons (5) Turn right at the intersection of Pachinko and Sons","March 30, 2016","19    Richmond Hotel Namba Daikokucho

Upon reaching the station , take exit 1 to the ground level , then left towards a Red building with the big words ""Pachinko & Slots"". The hotel is slightly off the main road but still visible. As mentioned by many travelers , it is a relatively new hotel , clean and modern. Everything works well from the moment we check-in till we reach our room. However , the room is rather small in my opinion and we have problem finding a place to open up our big luggage without interfering with access. Other than this , every aspects of the room is well taken care of. I like to mention that if you have doubts whether to opt for the breakfast , do not hesitate and go for it. The variety they offer for breakfast , while not duly extensive , is sufficient with a good spread. They even offer ""halal"" meals which will be a plus point for Muslim travelers looking for suitable accommodation. After breakfast , the restaurant is converted to a lounge offering free flow of drinks to hotel guests throughout the day till 8pm.

854,"We stayed here for four nights in a double room. Check-in was efficient and we used a self-service kiosk to pay for the room and get an extra room card. The staff here were very helpful and friendly. As per our high floor request in the booking, we received a room on the 8th floor. The hotel had many brochures that they had made themselves, with attraction maps and food maps, all in relation to the location of the hotel itself. These maps were great in helping us to find good restaurants around the hotel as well as which train lines to take to get to some major attractions, such as the Osaka castle. The location of the hotel is good. It is a 3 minute walk to the Daikokucho metro station. By taking the midosuji line from Daikokucho, you are one stop from Namba (major eating street Dotonburi and shopping area), one stop from the Tsutenkaku tower and about 8 stops from Shin-Osaka (where the Shinkansen departs/arrives). The room itself is great and a good size for a couple with two large suitcases, two duffle bags and two backpacks! There is a clothing rack to hang jackets, a desk, a bath and a toilet seat with a seat warmer! The bed is one of the comfiest I've stayed in and the television is huge (42""). However, there was only CNN to watch in English. But there was paid tv with movies, which cost 1000 yen per day. Check out is 11am, but we checked out at 12pm, which cost 1000 yen extra (it is 1000 yen per hour after 11am). Our check out was efficient and only took about 1 minute.

Although it was a good size for Japanese rooms it soon became clear that as we were overlooking busy roads it was going to be noisy. The road noise continued pretty much through the night and then the construction work outside started! We were glad we were only staying the one night.

Bathroom small but we found all the bathrooms in all the hotels we stayed in were small. Room for one but tight squeeze for two people. We ate our evening meal here and the food was lovely. They did a buffet and there was plenty of choice.,"June 2, 2018","20    Hotel Elsereine Osaka

878,"Everything in Osaka seems to be underground, as if it were a freezing cold city. The subway tunnels are initially awkward to navigate and it is easy to go astray. (Not the hotel's fault!) When we eventually found the hotel, it was equally difficult to find the entrance to reception. The staff here were accommodating and arranged for a breakfast box for the following morning since we had to leave before breakfast started. However, there is no one to carry luggage to/from your room; you can use a trolley but this is not easy at 05.30 when you have five million other things on your mind. A minor detail, but one which I feel the hotel could and should address. The receptionist actually left his post to assist us with luggage down to the waiting taxi, so full marks to him for compassion.","April 28, 2018","20    Hotel Elsereine Osaka

879,Nice hotel. Very clean and good sized rooms. Bed is quite firm though so I found it hard to sleep. Bathroom has lots of amenities which is handy. Friendly English speaking staff. Close to Osaka station (10 minute walk) and other trains with easy access anywhere. I wouldn’t recommend eating breakfast here though as eggs and sausages were stone cold.

880,"Just left from the hotel after the vacation. The hotel is near the airport express bus station and just take around 10-15min to walk. The location is quite convenience. There are some convenience stores and excellent quality restaurant beside the hotel. For me, some of the points I dislike. 1, although location is quite good, it is far away from the Osaka station / some main interchange stations and the main department store like Grand Front Osaka. 2, the wifi is not fast and in low signal sometimes. 3, the tv placement is bad which locate near the window side not at the front. and i guess there is very limit channel they offered to the visitor. I cannot find one of the channel that about japanese drama.","February 10, 2018","20    Hotel Elsereine Osaka

881,"Maybe it is because the decor is mainly in white, which would show the slightest stains and splotches, but the rooms looked a bit worn and unclean (e.g. scratches on walls and stains on the carpet). Service was also average and the staff, though polite, did not really seem to care.Although this hotel is close to Nishi-umeda subway station, travelling between Osaka station and and the hotel would most likely be done by walking as they are connected by underground walkways. However, this walk is not easy (15 min if you can find your way on the first try) as the signage is not always clearly labelled and the walkways are always crowded. Unless it is snowing or raining, it would be much easier to walk on ground level so you get better bearings. If your activities are centred around the Osaka/Umeda area, you may be better off finding a hotel in another location (e.g. Yodoyabashi) but closer to a subway station.","January 22, 2018","20    Hotel Elsereine Osaka

Getting to this hotel from main Osaka Station is quite a distant, again you can go via underground shopping area.

887,"Location: I'll start off how to get here as I wasted alot of time with lots of luggage )':Tip: If possible, take a train to NISHI-UMEDA station. That's right at the foot of Dojima underground shopping centre and it'll be a breeze to get to the hotel. You can also get here from Namba station in case you took the Nankai line from the airport. From JR Osaka station:Walk towards the South gate, Yotsubashi Line (Blue colour).You will see Eki Marche on your right. If you turn right to Eki Marche, follow the path and go down the escalator on your right to Macdonald's. Follow the underground passageway with Murals on the walls.Follow until you see an Exit 8. This would be the one right behind the exit to Hilton Osaka. (It leads off diagonally to the left, assuming Hilton Osaka exit is on your left.) Follow the path to Dojima Underground Shopping Centre. Turn left into Exit C84 which has a Hotel Elsereine signage on top before the exit. Go into the lift lobby and take a lift to the 2nd floor, where you should find the reception lobby. (If you happened to walk towards Daimaru, go straight through the doors and turn right, there should be a small flight of steps up, follow that path towards the Yotsubashi line/Nishi-Umeda line and you will eventually end up in the scenario above where you look for an Exit 8 and so on..)From JR Umeda:Walk towards JR Osaka station. If you happen to get up onto a connecting bridge with LUCUA and Yodabashi Camera around you, take the escalator down to B1 and find your way to JR Osaka.Hotel rooms were spacious, although the carpet was a little worn out. Great view from my room on the 12th floor, and really charming Cinderella concept to the hotel. (Their main doors close at 12 am, wondering if it's a coincidence)Whole hotel is Non-Smoking which is great for me. I reached at 12pm and they let me check in early since they prepared the room. Normal check in is at 3pm. Nice. Took a night flight and they allowed me to keep my luggages there til evening when I left. Would be perfect if they gave a free bottle of water :) (All other amenities provided for.)Overall, great stay. But I really recommend planning on how to move around from Nishi-Umeda station.","September 5, 2017","20    Hotel Elsereine Osaka

888,"My husband and I stayed in Hotel Elsereine Osaka for 2 nights. The hotel is very convenient in location and can be accessed from Osaka JR station using underground subway in around 10 min. However, there are many subways around the station so make sure that you are finding the right way. You may look for Eki Marche near JR station and there is an exit C-1 leading to underground street. Then you can find the way to Hilton Plaza at the underground street and the subway between Hilton Plaza West and Hilton Plaza East is the correct subway going to the hotel. The Hotel Elsereine Osaka is just a few steps from exit C-84 and you can take an elevator to the lobby level from the subway level B1. There is no need to go outside after leaving the JR station so it is very convenient even if you carry many luggages or under bad weather. There are many shopping malls and restaurants near the JR station and you can absolutely spend a day or two just shopping nearby.Staff at the reception are very helpful and the check in and check out process are quick and simple. The room size is not very big but should be fine with 2 people and 2 luggages. The bed is comfortable and the washroom is clean with many toiletries provided. Kettle, fridge and hair dryer are also available. Just one thing making me a bit disappointed is that there are many stains on the carpet. Wifi signal is stable and the connection is smooth.We didn't try the breakfast in hotel but the environment of the restaurant seems very nice. There are many lockers available at the JR station and the nearby subway station so you can store your luggages at the station after check out to save the time from going back to the hotel to get back the luggages.I will recommend this hotel if you want a decent short stay and convenient location.","August 13, 2017","20    Hotel Elsereine Osaka

889,"Several reviews talked about how far the hotel is from the station and times quoted were between 10 and 20 minutes walk which is a big difference. The hotel is actually 10 minutes walk from Osaka Train Station and less than 2 minutes walk from the nearest subway station - IF you know where you are going and without luggage as the underground area is very busy with local commuters as well as tourists going all directions, and the signage can be confusing and it will take longer if you have suitcases; there are escalators but you will need to find them which takes extra time.From Osaka station just head towards to Dojima Shopping area and then just keep on walking, then you will see the one of the exit signs with the name of the hotel. From there the stairs take you to above ground or to the lifts to the hotel. There is no need to go above ground from Osaka train station. The underground area has shops and restaurants so very convenient.The hotel seems to be more catered for Asian tourists as most leaflets were in Chinese and/or Korean. Receptionists spoke English and were reasonably helpful although they did not always seem to know how to go to some tourist places, unlike some other hotel receptionists in other major cities where there are lots of tourists.Some other reviews said the room was small. The room certainly wasn't big but there was enough room for two people and two suitcases (unlike the room I stayed in Tokyo, it was VERY small).","June 1, 2017","20    Hotel Elsereine Osaka

They have free wifi but it's only for your room. If you go down the lobby, you will be disconnected already. There's a vending machine & ice maker in every floor, this was the thing i liked about this hotel. The receptionist guy wasn't so friendly & not all can speak english, but most can understand. Location wise, it is near a train station, but we never went to that station since where we needed to go we had to always ride the main Osaka station. And it was a 10-12mins walk. This was a problem when it rained. There are convenience stores near the hotel & some restaurants too. Dotonburi was 15-20mins taxi ride, more if you take the train. Shinkansen station was just 10mins away by taxi. From the airport, it was quite far, about 1hr & 10 mins.Overall, this is a good hotel.

900,"This hotel is right in the centre of Osaka, just 500 metres from Osaka Umeda Station - walkable with a suitcase on wheels! (A taxi would be a bit of a rigmarole around the one-way system.)The hotel astonished us! Our impression was of almost dazzling overall whiteness with little bits of pink and glitz - white marble floors, white rough-casting, white grand-piano (the piano in a veritable sea of real pink begonias). All this, plus Cinderella's coach (turned back into an LED-lit pumpkin), and a strategically placed glass slipper (near the lifts). It felt like walking into a fairy-tale castle.Our room, however, was quiet, enormous and sumptuous. A corner room on the tenth floor, we entered via a hall-way which contained a full length mirror and a walk-in closet. This led to a small seating area, with table, two chairs and a standard lamp, situated at one end of the bedroom. Off the far end of the bedroom, was a bathroom suite: separate, fully-automatic toilet (opened and closed its own lid and flushed itself), a lobby with a hand-basin and mirror, and a separate wet-room with a shower and a bath.The extensive buffet breakfast is served at ground-floor level, around the grand-piano. There is a wide choice of Japanese and European foods in seemingly unlimited quantities.Staff were friendly and polite, with English speaking reception staff, and the whole hotel was immaculately clean. The room provided tea and coffee making facilities, including western-style black tea bags (although you do not get milk in Japan).Our only criticism is that there were no drawers - it would have been really nice to be able to unpack our suitcases! - and just four coat-hangers.","September 28, 2016","20    Hotel Elsereine Osaka

901,"The hotel is a ten minute walk from Osaka Station. The all white decor with pink accents in the lobby is certainly striking, but it also makes one very sensitive to any defects in cleanliness in the rooms. I stayed here one night and then returned for two nights a week later. The first room had a carpet that seriously needed cleaning or replacement, and the white decor emphasized this. I had a different room for my second stay, and the carpet was much cleaner. In both instances, the linens were clean and fresh. The people at the front desk spoke English. Breakfast buffet was very nice. In order to reach the lobby you must either go up an escalator which can be rather awkward with a large suitcase or find the elevator. I stayed here as a member of a tour group. If you plan on doing a lot of sightseeing in the Osaka area using trains and subways, I would compare prices as there are several hotels very near the station.","September 12, 2016","20    Hotel Elsereine Osaka

Since this is our first time to stay in this hotel, it's easier to find our way on the street instead of going through the underground. We take the Exit 8 at Umeda Midosuji line (South Exit), Daimaru is on the right with Hilton Hotel on the other side of the road. Walk round Hilton Hotel along the road and further down about 2 blocks, Hotel Elserine is on the left.Once we get used to the surroundings, it's easy to walk to Osaka/Umeda station using the underground. Simply take the hotel lift to LG, follow the signs and this is the best way to go to the station on a rainy day.The large and bright lobby of the hotel is on the second level, on top of the open restaurant on the ground floor and can be accessed by using escalator or lift.The lightning in the room is one of the brightest Of all the hotels that we stayed before. Some like the room to be dimmer and more romantic, but we prefer to be in this way. The room we stayed is 22 square meter and got enough space for us to move around.The hotel is built in 2010, clean and modern with decorations of Cinderella.

903,"We traveled as a couple in our 20's and stayed for 4 nights. Room 1204 on the 12th floor. Standard Twin Room.The hotel is located about a 8 minute walk from Osaka railway station and 12 form Umeda subway station and is accessible directly from Osaka's underground walkways. Just keep walking in the direction of the hotel until you see a big sign with the hotels name. It was raining most of the time while we were in Osaka so this was very practical. Nearby you can find tons of continence stores and Japanese-style restaurants.Check-in was quick and easy. We had already paid for our reservation through Hotels.com. We got our room key and was pointed toward the elevator. The reception is located on the 2nd floor and is accessible, from the ground floor, both with an elevator and escalators. The room was clean and bright. In the room was a TV, water kettle, hair-dryer, 2 beds, sofa-bed, a small table and a desk in front of the window. The view from the window on the 12th floor was okay, the big buildings in front of the hotel didn't allow for much of a skyline view. There were both regular curtains and black.out curtains to keep the room dark after sunrise. The beds were of the firmer type and comfortable to sleep in. Extra duvet and pillow was available in the room. There was an ice-machine and a vending machine full of alcoholic drinks next to the elevator on our floor.The bathroom had a bathtub, a Washlet-toilet with ""oshiro"" and bidet. Lots of toiletries: toothbrush, toothpaste (this tasted incredibly bad), hairbrush/comb, soaps, high-end one-use razor, shaving cream, hairnet, body-towel, cotton pads, q-tips, separate one-use shampoo and conditioner-packs. The staff made sure to refill everything daily, including the toothbrushes. This is always appreciated even if you don't use a new toothbrush every day it feels nice that you always have everything stocked up.The bathtub was bigger that that of a standard Japanese bathtub.We did not have anything to eat at the hotel so I cannot provide a review of the food but we did have one problem during our stay. The wifi in the room was extremely slow at times before disappearing altogether on the 2nd day. After telling the reception staff about this I got the wifi-password for the 2 adjacent rooms. Internet was still slow while sometimes disconnecting so that will be an issue if you're someone who likes to stream movies on Netflix etc.. The hotel had clearly printed out that the hotel had no guarantees that the Wifi quality would be good, so this doesn't affect my score a whole lot but it did take away from a otherwise great experience.The location, cleanliness of the room and price is enough for me to recommend staying and Elsereine Osaka.","July 8, 2016","20    Hotel Elsereine Osaka

904,"What I liked most about this hotel is it's close to the Osaka station about 8mins walk and has an underground shopping mall to entertain along the way and keep you dry if it's raining. You step into the hotel off the subway tunnel. The hotel itself is really aimed at business travellers and weddings as opposed to tourists but if you mainly aim to sleep here it's perfect. The staff are professional, the hotel is 'fancy' looking, according to my 7 yr old. There's even a crystal like horse and carriage in the foyer. We had a triple room and it was very cosy. Which is 3 single beds in the one room. There's no place for suitcases other than against the wall in front of the beds but it left a little walkway to get past. At times we had to climb across the beds to get past if someone was getting something out of their suitcase but like I said, if you are just aiming to sleep here than it's fine. Breakfast was included in our deal and they have a buffet. This included, fruit, juice, scrambled eggs, bacon, sausages, cereal, toast, pastries, sweet potato, dim sims. The food is not outstanding (although the pastries taste great) but it will fill you up until lunch. Espresso is included in the price. There are some restaurants within the hotel, we didn't eat there other than breakfast because in the underground mall outside there are plenty of restaurants that are cheaper. There's also a subway (sandwich place) and Outback steakhouse nearby if you want to eat something off a menu you understand for a change :) Price for the quality was good.","June 30, 2016","20    Hotel Elsereine Osaka

It was also quiet.Breakfast was very good, and had a wide range of types of food on offer. Westerners were well catered for.Overall this was a top class city hotel stay. Recommended.","June 12, 2016","20    Hotel Elsereine Osaka

906,Like the area where it's close walk to major subway station with lots of linkages underground to shops. Room is fairly small for a double room and added a rollaway bed for the third person in my room. Hardly space to put luggage and move. Vending machine outside of room has ice dispenser which is what I like.,"May 25, 2016","20    Hotel Elsereine Osaka

907,"This is a businesslike hotel in a stylish, modern building. Our room was spotless, sleek and of a good size for European standards. Location is excellent: the hotel is in a nice and quiet area, there are lots of small restaurants nearby and Osaka main station is just 7 minutes away on foot. We were very happy with our choice and would definitely go back. From KIX airport, take the Limousine bus and get off at Osaka station. This will take about 50 minutes. Then just walk to the hotel.","May 17, 2016","20    Hotel Elsereine Osaka

Now Hotel Elsereine Osaka is no ordinary hotel, its new its clean and very beautiful hotel with easy location, get down you will find a cab and go to Shin-Shibashi dont bother with trains it will waste time and if you are family of 4 use the cab i guess it wont cost you more than 1000YEN I have stayed their twice once in August 2015 and then in March 2016 and yeh the background score in hotel is very nice classical music!!

910,"I arrived a few days ago, and so far my stay has been more or less good. The room is big enough for one person, with a sofa , which is quite nice to just relax after a long touristic day ! This hotel would have been perfect if little things like: translating instructions into English , English Channel provided instead of only one CNN and dubbed to Japanese !!!i have difficulties in finding plugs in the room but only to discover they were covered and instruction of course in Japanese !!! How difficult could translating be these days??? Internet works perfectly well, the staff ar very helpful although with very limited English . The pajamas are provided and changed everyday..Am staying in this hotel until the 16 th of March , but writing this review in advance hoping to get the attention of management.

911,"We stayed at this hotel for one night, in a room with 3 single beds. It was a tight squeeze but cozy! The hotel is in a very good location, less than a 5 minute walk to Kitashinchi station, and about a 10-15 minute walk from Osaka Station. Near Osaka station you'll find a lot of shopping and eating options.The room itself was very clean. Basic toiletry supplies were provided. The reception staff were helpful. We tried the breakfast buffet on one morning - standard hot and cold breakfast options were provided but I personally don't think it was worth the cost. There are many eating options around the hotel.To get to and from the airport, I would recommend taking the Airport Bus from Kansai Airport to Herbis Plaza, then walk about 5-7min to the hotel. It's a much cheaper than the train and about as long (1 hour). You can also catch the Airport bus back to the Airport from Herbis Plaza.","February 26, 2016","20    Hotel Elsereine Osaka

914,"This is a relatively new hotel in the center of Umeda, vey convinient to all shopping places and the Osaka enormous central railway station. Also convinient for the bus transportation to KIX airport. The hotel decor when entering is very light and white which I personally find not atmospheric and business like. But this is a personal taste. Nothing wrong with the room/ everything is there. Amazing to see that in such a new hotel the rooms already need renovations± the carpet is tarnished, and the pain (white again) on the walls is showing it's wear. However, I must say that the price was very attractive so I didnt really care. Reception speaks some English and there is a business center in case you want to print something (extra cost). I did not have the breakfast there as there is a Starbucks just around the corner. All in all recommended.","January 3, 2016","20    Hotel Elsereine Osaka

917,"I recently stayed at The Park Front Universal Studios for 2 nights and it delivered what was needed. I was definitely worried about the potential noise factor, being in a hotel with so many children; but really didn’t hear much of anything once inside the room.For all of the lobby glitz, the room was spacious, but basic. I was in a park view room with 2 single beds. The bed were firm, which I love. Though it was a twin bed, it’s not what we consider a twin in the US, it’s definitely bigger. Two kinds of pillows offered: thicker and thinner- which was nice.There is a separate toilet room and bathroom. They were fine but nothing special. The bathroom consisted of a shower and tub room, so to speak. The towels were very thin.The safe was big enough to fit an iPad and something the size of a folder, which was helpful.The blackout shades, though helpful, did not truly blackout the light come morning.The room overall was tired and a bit dated. That being said, for the location and price, I was pretty happy. We were literally steps from the park and from the train...so convenient. For those reasons, I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel if you want to be close to the park.","June 10, 2019","0     The Park Front Hotel at Universal Studios Japan

926,"This hotel is located literally 100 meters from USH gates.Some tips:- if you traveling with family from Kansai Airport, it is more convenient to go by bus to universal studio. It took less that an hour. From the universal studio bus stop it is like 300 meters walk to the hotel. If you travel by train, the universal city station is also very close to the hotel.- if you arrive early, the hotel will keep your luggage and they will have it ready in your room by the time you come back- you can purchase USJ tickets and express pass from the tickets counter at the 3rd floor (next to the check in counter)- breakfast buffet spread is awesome. There are an extended japanese and international selection. It is good value for money and best option before going to the park- for lunch and dinner there are numerous restaurants option in the universal city shopping & dining area. They are open until late.- there are luggage forwarding service (Ta-Q-Bin) at the 2nd floor. It opens from 7 am to 12 pm. I use it to send big luggages to my next hotel in Tokyo- They have a room with park view. It depends on your personal judgement, but after spending a whole day or two at the park I wouldn’t pay extra for that view. The room and bathroom is very spacious though- they dont provide iron & ironing board in the room but you can ask to borrow one.- there is lawson store at ground floor. It’s very convenient to buy some snacks, drinks and other stuff. They also sell electrical adaptor and other crucial traveling stuffs.","January 17, 2019","0     The Park Front Hotel at Universal Studios Japan

I love spacious rooms (something that is rare in Japan).I didn’t go for the breakfast option as it’s quite expensive and there are a couple of good cafes nearby. I’m glad I didn’t as I see huge lines outside the cafe in the morning. I wouldn’t want to queue for my breakfast especially if I’m rushing to USJ. It’s a beautiful hotel and yes, I will recommend it if u are intending to visit USJ. Try the sushi place (revolving sushi) nearby as it’s pretty good! There’s loads of eateries where the hotel is. Try asking for the room facing universal studios. I think it’s more expensive though.

928,"Stayed at this hotel from 2nd till 3rd Dec 2018, Room 2202 and 2203. The booking was made via online through their website. Check in process is normal and can be considered average. There is nothing special of the services rendered by the reception staff. My main concern is that no one assisting us (I come with my family of 5) with our luggages upon our arrival. We arrived via taxi at the ground floor roughly around 7pm. There is only 1 lady staff at the small concierge unit. Not so fluent in English and just told my family “check in upstairs “. We have to carry out out luggage on our own to the lobby by the escalator. She is not telling us whether there is an elevator or otherwise and till today I really not sure about it.Nothing to shout about the room as I believe on par with other resort boutique theme park hotel. Main advantage is just the hotel is near to USJ and located along the universal walk. The rest I think is average and could be a bit expensive and not worth of money.Breakfast is ok. Maybe it’s time for the hotel management to consider halal @ Muslim friendly food as the number of Muslim customers are growing fast. Another thing probably the tv channel inside the hotel could provide ‘live’ coverage of the theme park for information of its patrons. There is a counter selling tickets for the park inside the hotel which may benefit the customers. ","December 7, 2018","0     The Park Front Hotel at Universal Studios Japan

You can easily purchase the tickets and fast lane passes right in the hotel, so there is no need to queue at the park ticket counters. The room was huge and the view as even better. It was especially interesting to see what is going on after the park closes with all the preparations during the night. A must see for Universal Park fans. There is also a train station with quick access to other parts of Osaka. There was no desk or workplace for a laptop and given the room size, they could easily add that.

933,"We've stayed at the Park Front Hotel @ USJ on last Sunday night. We chose this property as we thought we might stayed until the park closed. We did arrive in the morning to leave all baggage then spent time at USJ. The check-in process is not complicated and take just 2 minutes. When we came back to the hotel, our room was ready and luggage was delivered to the room already. The room is big compared to Japanese standard room. The hotel provided all amenities we needed and specially the foot spa pads, it's very nice after you walked all the days at USJ. The decoration may not be super-fancy like you stayed at Disney official's Hotel but it's fine for me as we didn't travel with children. There is vending machine, ice machine and microwave on the floor we stayed (28th floor). Breakfast, we didn't expect much on this so it's beyond our expectation. The line buffet is great, there are variety of foods and we're really enjoy. We did book the room directly at Hotel's website as it's cheaper than the other website. Even hotel is not located in the city center but, personally, I still recommended this hotel for the others, especially, if you have a train pass and mainly use JR, not subway.

This was the most expensive hotel I've ever stayed in & there was nothing that made it better than the rest.Really uncomfortable pillows that meant a bad night sleep, breakfast was so unorganised that people were queuing for at least 30 mins while tables were empty but not cleaned, (it doesn't help that the breakfast area isn't big enough for the size of the hotel) then extortionate parking prices on top of the extortionate room costs.Hotel Keihan Universal Tower is right next door and cheaper so we'll try that one next time.","September 16, 2018","0     The Park Front Hotel at Universal Studios Japan

938,Pros. 2nd summer visits and celebrations for my husband. Close to USJ. Clean. Spacious room. Buffet breakfast ok.Cons. My husband brought some candies out for my daughter who did not goto conplmentary breakfast. A staff blocked his way and asked him to put back. I was outside & asked what happened. He showed me a sign & said loudly & rudely to me that this is rule not to bring any food outside.. My husband said a 3-year old child in front of him also got candies on hand was also asked to put back candies which made her cry. Why so rude? My husband then stayed for some more time. This staff talked & looked at my husband many times & laugh. This was the birthday of my husband & he had bad feeling. He said he would never visit this hotel again.,"August 23, 2018","0     The Park Front Hotel at Universal Studios Japan

943,Can't go wrong staying here if you want to go to Universal Studios. It is literally 100 meters to the entry gate. It is the closest one to it. Great view of the park from our side of the hotel overlooking the park. The buffet restaurant is probably the biggest I have ever seen its massive and does all the way around to the left hand side of the entrance. More food choices for breakfast than I have ever seen. Staff were great especially Koyama who went out of her way to print off some documents for me. Hotel is surprisingly quiet considering its location. Rooms area good size and very clean.

The most amazingly vast and varied breakfast Buffet with western, and Japanese cuisine. Especially fun for kids with multiple cereal, candy, fondue as well as ice cream options.8.

954,"I stayed at this hotel on a visit to Osaka with my family. The rest of my family are theme park fans and this hotel proved to be a very convenient choice because it is located right by the Universal Studios theme park. The hotel was very clean and comfortable and room sizes were good. When you exit the back of the hotel the universal city is right there , boasting of lots of different restaurants, shops, a huge candy store , a convenience store and many more. The train station is also located right by the hotel . If you mainly want to be right by the park, this is a great hotel since the park is a short walk to the universal studios park otherwise there is nothing else around the hotel, one has to either take the train or a taxi to go to other parts of the city. I was frustrated also because this is one of the few international hotels where very little orAlmost no staff spoke decent english. I think for being such a family oriented hotel with a western theme park, i think the hotel should be better equipped with a more multilingual staff. It was difficult to go to anyone , even to the concierge to ask for help with reservations or just simply to ask questions or make suggestions as to where to go other than the park.

962,"Hotel was booked because it was so close to universal. It is close by taxi to the Osaka aquarium and LEGO land, however public transport is not so quick if your goi g from the hotel to either LEGO land or the aquarium as you need to change lines and they line to the aquarium and LEGO land is not on a JR line which means your JR pass won’t work (but only a small fee). Taxi from Shin Osaka to the hotel is approx ¥6000 depending on time of day. Getting into Osaka city is quick by JR Tain from Universal City. The hotel isn’t central to everything, but if your willing to travel a bit and have the money (not for budget trips) it’s worth the stay. Area surrounding the hotel is known as Universal City (Same Name as the train station). It has some cool shops as well as heaps of restaurants. Good pricing varies depending on where you go, however value is good in General. Hotel breakfast is great and can’t complain. Hotel is super convenient to go to Universal studios. We went on our last day just as the park opened at 10am. We checked out and left our bags at reception and went straight to the park. Lines where moderate and I’m glad we didn’t have to wake up earlier to get there from Osaka or further away. Once we finished at the park (around 6:30pm) we walked back to the hotel and got a taxi back to Shin-Osaka Would definitely stay again if I’m back.

965,"Being right in front of the USJ entrance brings out a massive sigh of relief from tired parents coming out of USJ - and it was great to come back to a good hotel after a full day at USJ.Location - its approx 1 hour 15 minutes using the airport express bus from Kansai airport and it stops at the bus stop, about 5 minutes walk away. Its flat all the way so no problems with pushing those roller bags - you will be walking past the entrance of Universal Studios and then voila, you will see the hotel. We actually stayed a full week in this hotel even though we did not go to USJ each day. While its not in the main part of Osaka, you have the Universal City train station right next to the hotel. Getting to Namba is about a 20 minute train ride away, which for us was not a problem as the trains are frequent enough. We in fact did day trips out to Kyota and Nara without much hassle. The hotel is part of the Universal City Walk so there are plenty of restaurants to choose from. The hotel has a Lawsons convenience store in its premises, and there is another one just outside - if you get hungry, the Lawsons sells plenty of food - both hot and cold, as well as some of the most fabulous, value for money desserts. Try the cream puffs!The rooms are large and long - so for us, we had 4 beds next to one another, in a very long, slightly narrow room. No issue with the room size, it was comfy enough and pretty large for Japanese standards. Fantastic bathroom amenities, spanking clean, wifi was good. If you can, do get a room that faces the park. It is lovely to see the park during sun rise, and we could also see the fireworks every night from the Christmas show. At the same time you can see the Tempozan Ferris wheel, which is very pretty in the night. The hotel was great with providing accessories for our toddler - like bed rail, and stool which was fantastic. Tickets for USJ can be bought in the hotel and charged to the room. This was useful as you do not need to queue at USJ to purchase the tickets. We had the buffet breakfast each day - pretty good variety, with a Japanese/Asian slant, but quality is very decent, and plenty to eat. We love how they deal with the crowds very efficiently - so even during the peak hours, food is topped up, and queues are manageable. A slight issue would be the difficulty in communication in English, an issue that is not just in this hotel so its not entirely a criticism. We had problems trying to understand the USJ express pass system, and had problems finding a money changer (Which by the way is in the Keihan hotel next door) and problems finding a route to the airport without using the taxi.Our communication with the hotel staff was difficult due to the language barrier. While they were always polite, they were not necessarily helpful in providing proper instructions - again, likely due to language. So if you need help with directions, train schedules, train routes- use Google Maps. It was particularly helpful when figuring out the train system.","December 14, 2017","0     The Park Front Hotel at Universal Studios Japan

967,"I’ll keep it short.Pros: - a extremely short walking distance to USJ. Staying late to watch the Christmas show knowing that the hotel is near after a long day was great.- check-in was a breeze.- I took domestic flight to osaka, round trip for limo bus was a breeze.- I like how their bathroom and toilet are separated. Cons:- universal city was fun to walk but limited choices of food. Need to travel out with at least 40 mins train ride. I recommend this hotel just for USJ stay for a night or two. Do travel light to get here (I.e a luggage will be sufficient for 2 to 3 people), it will be easier for you. ","December 1, 2017","0     The Park Front Hotel at Universal Studios Japan

968,Just a few steps from USJ's entrance and the Universal City Station. Very good location especially after a very tiring day at Universal Studios. Got a standard quadruple room but was upgraded to a superior with park view!The room is big though with 4 beds a bit cramped but we don't mind. Bath room is separate from toilet and everything is so clean. There's also a lawson store with atm inside the hotel and a coin operated laundry.A bit far from Osaka proper but for us it served its purpose because we were already dragging our 7 year old after spending an entire day in the park. So overall it was a great stay and my kids loved it. ,"November 8, 2017","0     The Park Front Hotel at Universal Studios Japan

There is also not a lot going on in this part of town but, given it's closeness to a subway station, this suited us just fine. The room was clean and comfortable, a little on the small side (as is to be expected in Japan). We enjoyed our stay here. I was however, a bit confused on the room types and may have ended up booking a less nice room for the same price as an upgraded room not realising the difference between deluxe and comfort. Rooms on higher floors with access to the bar would be nice as the restaurant seemed confused when we popped in for a drink and a snack. In saying this, the sashimi was some of the best we ate in Japan! I would stay here again. ","May 31, 2019","22    Mitsui Garden Hotel Osaka Premier

The bed was very comfortable but I found the pillows very hard, when mentioned to reception they did supply some more they said were softer, but it was difficult to tell any difference.

The hotel is about a 5 minute walk from the subway which was convenient. Unfortunately the hotel didn’t have a great vibe. It seemed like it was located in a kind of business area so there wasn’t much going on there. The hotel also doesn’t have a bar which was a bit of a downer. We paid extra to stay on one of the floors which had access to the hotels exclusive lounge, unfortunately the lounge was literally just some couches in a room that had average views. There was some free tea and coffee there as well. Also I don’t know how exclusive it was cause anyone could walk in there.

The staff were helpful, and all spoke good English. Unusually for Japanese hotels, all of the various gadgets in the room were also labelled in English.The hotel restaurant is quite good, and surprisingly reasonably priced. Breakfast is a bit on the expensive side and largely focused on Japanese guests: the western-style options were limited, with the hot food being lukewarm at best. While the hotel is a little bit out of the way, this isn't a bad thing as it's very quiet at night. The closest subway station is only a 5-10 minute walk away, and quickly takes you to Osaka station or the centre of the city. Getting to and from Kansai International Airport by train is a bit of a chore though, requiring two transfers.

985,"We caught the hotel's shuttle bus from the station - it was relatively easy, we only had to ask one railway official which side of the road it departed from. On arrival at the hotel, we were delighted to see a sleek modern highrise situated adjacent to a river. After a fast check-in, we were also delighted to see our bags in the room, given we had forwarded them 2 days prior. The room was fabulously appointed. Floor to ceiling windows with a beautiful river and cityscape view; stylish sliding wooden screen divided the bedroom from the foyer/bathroom; the best tiled bathroom - fully enclosed; good size bath and free standing shower; cupboards/dressing table/ basin and separate toilet, are in another area. The tones are understated, with textured wallpaper and the room was quiet and dark, with blockout curtains, ensuring a good nights rest.Thoughtful touches included free wifi and a free mobile phone, accessible for the duration of the visit - ensuring you were unlikely to get lost. A man made onsen on the top floor added to the relaxation. The restaurant on the first floor was first class. The location provided the opportunity for walks alongside the river, access to wonderful restaurants, bakeries and sweet shops tucked away in the highrises and walking distance to the Science Museum and Museum of Modern Art. The free shuttle bus linked the hotel to the train station, providing regular access.

986,"Needless to say, I will not be staying here or at any other of the Mitsui Garden Hotels. Upon arrival after arriving in Narita and taking the Shinkansen from Tokyo to Osaka and being delayed because of a typhoon. I arrived hoping to just get some rest. Unfortunately, this would not be the case.I started by checking in and sent numerous emails months in advance that my room would be for just two people. I had to change which friend would be staying with me, since another was going to be arriving late and found their own hotel. This was discussed via email with the staff two months in advance.So, after clearing up this confusion, again. Even though two months in advance, they said they understood. I was told my room was not available. That only a King bed was, after I reserved a room with two beds. I was too tired from traveling for over 24 hours straight and a typhoon. I just said “fine” and went to my room.Before I stay in any room, I always check for bed bugs. This is a habit I have done since I started traveling on a regular basis since 2011. Quickly into my search, a bed bug was found, I recorded a video of it and showed the two young ladies at the front desk. I asked to speak with a manger. They said that no manager was there. This was the final straw and I demanded a refund and called a small local hotel that was bed bug free and stayed there. This was the worst experience at a hotel I’ve had in Japan to date. This was my fourth time in Japan and can’t believe how unorganized and unclean a hotel could be. If I could give zero out of five, I would.","November 13, 2018","22    Mitsui Garden Hotel Osaka Premier

Thanks to previous TA comments we knew to get the free shuttle bus on our arrival outside Albi outdoor store, after exit Osaka station via Sakurabash gate. Walk half way down the store front and you will see busstop information signs for several hotels. The hotel is in the business district, and there are a few good hidden gems nearby for drinks, dinners, etc, particularly Manryo and Beer Belly, if that’s your thing. Hotel restaurant also seems to do good meals at lunch, etc. We opted to have breakfast there on 2 days. It was enjoyable, very Japanese as you would expect, we enjoyed it, tho it doesn’t vary much. This is standard for most hotel breakfast buffets world wide so not a criticism, eggs your way available, toast, cereal, so you don’t have to eat like a local. We were here when the second typhoon hit on 29 Sep, and pretty much the whole city began to close down as a precaution from noon. We almost got stuck in Osaka as even the metro started to close at 2pm. The hotel kept us informed via tannoy system about shuttle bus stopping. We had an early dinner reservation across the bridge at Manryo, and decided to brave the torrential rain as it was only 5mins away. The staff spoke to us on leaving to ensure we would be safe which was considerate of them. To be honest at 6pm it wasn’t that bad, much heavier when we returned 90mins later. We checked in with them on our return so they knew we were safe. This is a country that puts personal safety high, so it wasn’t a surprise places closed. The Seven Eleven’s were doing a great trade on food and snacks that night! Would definitely return as it is a great base.

999,"We booked 3 rooms this property at a high price and we expected a lot more. The reception area was really so so. The service was good, nothing much to say about that. The room was really small for the price, we expected larger rooms and that was the down side of our stay. The bed was comfortable and the facilities in room was modern. The highlight was the WiFi they lend you for your whole stay! What a great tool, we were there for a short stay so that made it way more practical to walk around and discover the area! The breakfast can be improved (food and service) for this type of establishment. The location is not the best but still ok","June 25, 2018","22    Mitsui Garden Hotel Osaka Premier

1000,"We had read favorable reviews of this hotel, and I will say, they were accurate: a very clean, midrange business-hotel property, decidedly within Osaka's business/financial district. There are a few things around, but take the free hotel shuttle to where the action is for shopping. The staff was friendly, not quite overwhelmed with a pretty busy day of guests,and everything worked out well--timing, taxi calling, luggage handling. The room was fine--clean, with a compact but nice layout. It was comfortable enough, but a squeeze for two. Would we stay again? Depends on what we do in Osaka, but if this hotel were convenient for our needs, it would be in the running. ","June 19, 2018","22    Mitsui Garden Hotel Osaka Premier

1002,The good about this hotel is still pretty new and lovely decor and big enough room for japanese std. Downside is location wise need 10-15 mins walk to subway station and its not mainline yotsubashi line. You need to walk further to main line which is midosuji line that connect you everywhere. You can connect through yotsubashi line but expect long walk. Love the onsen at garden spa 16th floor. Tried to booked smoking room but they ran out during my stay all smoking room are booked. They have smoking area at 2nd floor though. They provide free shuttle to/from osaka station south exit sakurabashi gate which is nice. But last shuttle from osaka station at 21.30. Nice overall stay just wish location is nearer to central subway line and got my smoking room. ,"June 10, 2018","22    Mitsui Garden Hotel Osaka Premier

But, it is located in a business area, and there is very few restaurants or shops near by.The room was very up to date, and as of now, is the only hotel that I have seen that had an available HDMI input port on the TV.

1005,"Stayed here with my daughter's family and 2 little grandkids. Very clean and rooms are small but efficiently laid out. If you have a room in one of the lounge access floors, you can use their lounge on the top floor; the same floor where the large spa baths are located. We were able to take the kids up to the lounge where they had more room to run around. The baths are nice, not crowded in the evening, and very relaxing. Don't forget to take a towel from your room since they don't have towels for you to use! The breakfast buffet offers a varied Japanese breakfast as well as some Chinese and western options. Overall, a very comfortable stay. Its in a business area, so it gets quiet at night. There is a shuttle bus to one of the bigger Osaka stations (Umeda)but they do not run at noon time.

1007,"My husband and I stayed here for two nights right in the middle of Golden Week 2018. Although the room was of a decent size for Japan and the bed was comfortable, we probably wouldn't opt to stay here again for a few reasons, but let's first start with the pros. PROSThe standard queen was a good size for two people by Japanese standards with good A/C and a fridge. However, those coming from countries where rooms are typically larger may find it a bit hard to move around with luggage. The shuttle to/from the Osaka train station (Osaka, not Shin-Osaka) was handy. If you have trouble finding the pick-up location at the station, just look for the Albi store (large outdoor shop) using the station directories/maps. Several busses and shuttles stop right in front of the Albi store and you just have to wait next to the sign posted for the Mitsui Garden Hotel (shuttle is a burgundy color). Check the hotel website for pick-up times, but note that there are no transfers for a couple of hours during mid-day. There is a small onsen on the top floor (separate for men and women). I don't believe I could go because apparently those with tattoos are not allowed (per past reviews, but I never tried or asked as I wasn't really interested). If this is what brings you here and you have tattoos, you may want to contact the hotel to confirm. They provide a smart phone to use throughout your stay. It's in the room on a charging pod. This is getting pretty big and we have had the same phones in other Japanese hotels, as well as hotels in other countries. CONSAs they say...location, location, location! While this hotel has a great view next to the river, it didn't fit the bill for the way we like to travel, particularly due to the bad weather while we were there. It's a 1.5 km walk to the Osaka station to catch the JR loop (or take the hotel shuttle or subway that isn't included in the JR pass) and 3.5 kms to Dōtonbori. Without rain, this would have been fine for us and we would have just walked everywhere. However, even with good weather, this makes getting around Osaka a bit more challenging for those with young kids. The last return shuttle to the hotel from Osaka Station at 21:30 was too early for us to catch (we didn't go back to the hotel until 23:00 or later both nights). While there is a Starbucks in the building across the street (to the right - kind of hidden behind the Family Mart), there isn't much else in the immediate vicinity. In summary, we just personally did not like the location of the hotel and would opt for something closer to Dōtonbori as we found ourselves there both nights during our stay. However, if you don't mind walking the distances and the weather is good OR it doesn't bother you to have to take the subway to get everywhere, then this hotel could be okay for you (especially at the right price).

1008,"Terrible start to our stay here. Check in is at 3pm. We arrived at 11:30am. Our room was ready, but we were nonetheless forced to pay a $150AUD early check in fee. The only thing we needed to use in the room was an iron (as my wife was attending a business meeting before 3pm and needed to iron her shirt). This was clearly explained to the lady at the reception, who did not budge and refused to call the manager. So, we ended up paying $150AUD to iron a shirt. Massively unfair.

1010,"This hotel has very informative website.FreeShuttles run between Osaka JR Station 2-3 times most hours the exact times are on website.The room was good size for Japan.We were in Supreme Double without view on 14th floor.I suggest you do not pay extra for access to lounge unless you drink excessive volume of coffee..

No sodas.No bottled water.The bathroom is typical Japanese style. It is a wet room with no separate shower.The very large flat screen TV has CNN.The only negative was the distance from shopping which is 2.2 km , in Japan pedestrian traffic that is a good 15 to 20 minute walk. The subway and metro is very little assistance in this regard as the walk to subway that takes you to shops is 700 metres then another 800 from closest station to the shops.There are many small good restaurants within walking distance.There are separate men and womens olsens on 16 floor free of charge for guests.

1013,"Osaka was our first port of call on our Japanese trip, and we were delighted to be able to call the Mitsui Garden home for three nights.Upon arrival (a Saturday morning), we were a little surprised to find the area around the hotel so quiet, but it certainly came to life Monday morning (this being a business area).One thing business people need the world over is coffee, and there is a plentiful supply of cafes around the hotel. We sampled a few, as our room didn't include breakfast. All of which were really good (there is also a Starbucks amongst these, for those who want something familiar).Most of the areas tourists will want to access in Osaka, including Umeda and Dotombori are easily accessible by the two subway stations which are a short walk from the hotel.The hotel itself is fabulous, it has such a warm homely feel to it, thanks to the decor and the friendly, welcoming staff. The room are also well appointed, with lovely wooden floors (be sure to take your shoes off!) and are a good size for Japanese hotel rooms. Everything is fairly new and as you would expect for a mid-range hotel like this.Conveniently for travellers, there is an onsite laundry, a bargain at Y300 per load.There is also a public bath on the top floor. While I didn't use this, my partner said it was terrific.Overall, we really enjoyed our stay at the Mitsui Garden during our time in lovely Osaka. Highly recommended.","April 10, 2018","22    Mitsui Garden Hotel Osaka Premier

1016,"Arrived at KIX around 8:30 pm and after reading on trip advisor, i understand the shuttle services stopped at 9:30pm so we took the cab from Umeda station back to the Hotel. It costs us around 680 yen. Check in service was smooth. Front desk staff were extremely helpful. Rooms are normal size as other Japanese hotels, and I think this is more spacious than other hotels I have been in Tokyo. LOVE the bathroom, with the toilet, sink and shower/ bath tub are seperated (I really can't get enough of it). The hotel is also very quiet at night, being away from the Umeda station.There's a convenience store right across the hotel that opens 24-7, including Sunday. Shuttle service was great. And nothing beats the convenience of Umeda station, with JR and all other subway/ train passing by. You can easily hop on the train to Kyoto, Wakayama and surroundings. There are also lots of department stores around the Umeda station.

What I liked the most was the Japanese-style toilet and bathroom.Very large TV screen, though not in a very favourable position, as one cannot watch TV from the bed without having to turn one's neck. I guess the layout of the room doesn't allow to have the TV in front of the bed, but still. I found it very impractical. The choice of TV channels is as per Japanese standard, which means that CNN is the only English-language channel.I missed a bottle of water in the room.Breakfast caters mainly for a Japanese clientele, but I was pleasantly surprised about the toast, which was excellent in taste and with the right thickness. Not easy to find such good toast in Japan. Also the freshly brewed coffee was excellent and not necessarily expected.A few things that could perhaps be improved (though the position of the TV may be a challenge), but overall a hotel that offers a very pleasant stay at a reasonable rate.","January 25, 2018","22    Mitsui Garden Hotel Osaka Premier

The Breakfast Buffet is the best among the whole family Trip in Osaka. The Buffet locates at the 1/F, where provides different varieties of food and beverages for you to choose.

1036,"Negatives-(1) The Hotel was not centrally located for shopping (depending on what you wanted to buy) but you can always get a taxi at reasonable rates (there were 3 of us so we shared the fares). Wish had a longer stay.(2) The walls and ceilings are not sound proofed; you can hear sounds from other rooms especially from upstairs. But still 'manageable' though.(3) The hotel rate can be considered pricey but then again we're in Japan so yeah :P Positives-(1) I must commend they staff especially those at the reception counter as well as those at their souvenir shop. They speak good english and and were able to provide assistance and give recommendations and they were very friendly and attentive. (2) We only spent 1 night in Osaka and we checked in around 8,.30 p.m. after arrival from Hiroshima, I wanted to do a little shopping at UNIQLO & H&M... one of the female staff member at the reception helped to call a taxi but there was no taxi available so she asked me to wait at the nearby taxi stand and wrote a note in Japanese for me to show to the taxi driver. Everything went smoothly THANK YOU SO MUCH!!! (3) There is a duty-free store nearby the hotel. There is a taxi stand just next to the store.(4) There is a convenience store nearby too.(5) Their breakfast was very good with standard variety of Japanese/oriental as well as western dishes.","March 27, 2018","23    Hotel Plaza Osaka

But it’s still well within walking distance (less than 10min walk) and you get to see the neighborhood and it’s bars, shopping districts and eateries. Room cleanliness was good and the daily housekeeping kept it that way. The Iroha Guest Lounge is a fun place to hang out in with complimentary Japanese snacks with traditional Japanese and modern pop culture (anime cosplay) outfits that the lounge staff will help you don.

1044,"My husband and I stayed here for a week because it was convenient to my son's apartment and we were in town to spend time with him. We chose an executive twin and were pleasantly surprised at the huge room size (including a large leather couch with coffee table, round table and chairs, massage chair, two beds, and kitchenette, with space to spare). And the views from our 17th floor room were fantastic, with the river to the left and the sunset over the hills to the right. The place was big enough to entertain my son and his girlfriend a couple of times with no one sitting on beds! Those beds were nonetheless comfortable for sleeping and there was sufficient closet space. The bathroom was perfectly functional but lacking in aesthetics (a study in seamless tan plastic, just like I remember from an older business hotel my company used to use in Moriguchi). Overall, we were very comfortable and enjoyed our stay but don't expect luxury finishes and appointments (although it looked like some rooms were more updated). There are several restaurants on site; we ate lunch at the Japanese restaurant once and it was both very good and reasonably priced (plus discounts if you're a hotel guest). We'd stay here again in the same situation without hesitation. ","May 8, 2017","23    Hotel Plaza Osaka

1046,"The pro:Room was ok, view was ok. There was no smell in the room, it was quite clean and nice.Service was ok as well, very fast check in and check out.Price was fair.The con:Not a good location to explore Osaka. It is close to a station, but you'll spend some time to make your way to/from the hotel to the Osaka center, so I would suggest a hotel in the center already. (I booked to late, there was almost no room in Osaka center, or they would be too expensive).Also, located among some love hotels.Solo Female Point of View:The room and hotel are safe and ok.But the location was not that nice. I did not like to go through the front of so many love hotels. There was no one in front, nothing happen, and Japan is considered very safe place. But that doesn't mean you can let your guard down. So I really suggest you go for another hotel, more in the center.If you have company, doesn't mind staying a little far from the center (trains in Japan are fast and great), this hotel is ok.So:Are you in a group and don't mind train travel? Stay here!Are you a solo female? Try somewhere else.With all respect to the workers of the hotel, they were all very polite and great!

1047,"This hotel is located at the edge of the Red Light District which is not nearly as scary as it sounds. Rooms are very tiny which is to be expected in a major city. It is a massive hotel and was popular at the time of our visit with school kids after a day at Universal. This was the last night of our study abroad adventure in Japan and we enjoyed a farewell dinner in a less than private dining area. Tough to make emotional speeches when you're competing for sound. Went for a run across the nearby bridge to get into the heart of Osaka to explore the area around the base of the Omeda Sky Building which we later toured. About a 30 min run but you will compete for space with bikes on the bridge so be careful. Not many of staff speak English so practice up on some Japanese. On a more positive note, at this point in our journey I was seriously craving a beer with flavor (not the same beer with a different label or can) and I found a nice IPA in the hotel gift area. Not cheep but tasty.","July 6, 2016","23    Hotel Plaza Osaka

1050,"I stayed for 4 nights with my parents. We came by bullet train and arrived at Shin-Osaka, and took a taxi to the hotel. It was close enough so that the fare was pretty cheap.Location:When the taxi was pulling into the area, I became pretty worried. We had just stayed in a nice area in Tokyo, and by comparison this area looked pretty sketchy. The area had several ""Love Hotels"", and was generally unattractive. I was pretty relieved when we finally arrived at the hotel, and it was the nicest thing in the area.Upon walking in, you could tell it was really nice and classy. We arrived too early to check-in, but the staff stored our bags for us while we went out. Then, there were no problems checking-in.The closest station is Juso, and it's not too far of a walk. There were a few restaurants nearby. We tried an Italian place, and an Okonomiyaki place, and neither of them had an English menu or English speaking staff. The staff was really nice though, and helped us as much as they could. I spoke just enough Japanese to get the gist of what they were saying, and we were able to have decent meals. The good thing was that Umeda Station (a big hub station connecting to Osaka JR Station) was only one stop away! So it was convenient enough to be able to travel to other places such as Nara, Kyoto, etc, Room:Our room was HUGE! We were really excited. Our hotel in Tokyo was tiny, but this room had 3-double sized beds, a lot of storage space for our belongings, and living-room area with couches and a coffee table. The only problem was that it smelled like smoke. The room was clean, but it had definitely been a smoker's room recently, and that bugged us. It bothered my mother a lot, so that night we told the front desk, and they were going to use a special machine the following morning to get rid of the odor. The next day, when we arrived, it still smelled. We went back to front desk, and they kindly agreed to move us to the next room. The room next door still had a faint smoker's smell, but not nearly as bad as the other room, so we agreed to stay. Food:The breakfast was buffet style. I was grateful there was an egg station where someone made your eggs to order. There were a lot of options to cater to several tastes, but none of the things I liked were high quality (scambled eggs, bacon, sausage, etc). I'm picky, though. But like I said, there were a lot of options (cereal, breads, etc). Every time we had breakfast before 8am it was extremely busy, and they stopped seating for breakfast at 9am. There were restaurants in the hotel as well, but they were obscenely expensive. On one day, we decided to have the Chinese Buffet. As usual, the staff was superb. But the food quality was low. For the three of us, it was about $100, which was not worth it, at all. I wonder if it was because we arrived at 8:30, half an hour before last order. Many of the restaurants closed at 9pm, which was pretty inconvenient for us because we are late-eaters. We were thinking about attending the steak place on the 19th floor because my parents wanted to see Teppanyaki-style dinner, but $65 per person for dinner was kind of steep for us, especially considering our crappy experience at the Chinese restaurant downstairs.Staff:The staff was really nice. They spoke enough English to help us with all our questions. We had no problems checking in or checking out. It was also nice of them to change our room. There were ladies assigned to hold the elevator for you, which was really cute touch. Overall, it was a good place for the price we paid.","April 4, 2016","23    Hotel Plaza Osaka

They provide all your basic needs, even the soap and the shampoo were Shiseido, one of the foremost brand in Japan. As most hotel in Japan does, the hotel really pays attention to the cleanliness of the surroundings so it was very convenient for me. The breakfast was average as they separated the venue for group & individual travellers. Maybe the served better on the other restaurant. However, the service for the group breakfast was amazing. Even though the restaurant was packed, the staffs were very fast in doing the buffet refill as well as clearing up the dirty dishes. They provide free wifi too in the public area and in the room.

1061,"This is a big hotel that one gets the impression that it is either in the four or five star hotel category, but it is not.CONS:1. The cost is in the ""pricey"" territory (about US$ 130 a night) that, methinks, for less than that, one can still get the same service and facilities. The point is, there is nothing remarkable about this hotel except, maybe, No. 2 below.2. Taking off from the typical Japaneses hotel, the rooms have two larger-than-usual bed: One queen size and one oversized single bed (48"" x 75""). Yes, this is true even in their ""single rooms."" I know since I booked both twin and single rooms and lo, I discovered that they are exactly the same, making me thin in hindsight that I should have booked all single rooms instead (cost is only about US$ 86).3. Because of No. 2 above, there is hardly any space between the two beds that one has to tip toe passing these two beds to be able to traverse from the main entry area to the other end of the room which is the window and TV area.4. As with other Japansese hotels. the cable TV are all Japanese channels that tourist may find it not necessary to turn on this appliance.5. The Toilet/Bath area is so miniscule that If you are big in height, say about 5'10 and above, you will have a hard time squeezing yourself inside it, much more its bath tub.6. The price stated in No. 1 above doesn't come with breakfast so no review of food here.7. Since this is a big hotel, there are times that using the lift will be a challenge and guests gathering at the lift waiting area tend to get noisy.8. On rush hours, the lobby area becomes noisy as guests gather in that area.9. There are no big shopping places nor tourist spots near the area.PROS.1. As mentioned in the title and No. 2 above, the beds provided can actually accommodate three persons.2. the rooms are neat and clean, ditto with beds and linens and towels.3. The hotel uses the Shiseido brand in its toiletries.4. The hotel location is fine with lots of convenenience store, a duty-free thrift shop (Don Quixote), eateries and flea market.5. Osaka is just one train station away.6. The hotel is very near the Juso Hankyu train station. Kyoto, through the end station called Kawaramachi station is just a train ride from Juse through the Hankyu line 7. After emerging from the Kawaramachi station, you can simply walk and go through the different tourist sites in Kyoto passing by several historic temples, shrines and parks.8.

There are coin operated machines for washing and drying laundry in the basement which worked well.The nearest station is Juso, which is part of the Hankyu Railway line. You can change to the subway system at Umeda. Just follow the signs for the Midsouji Line. Or, conversely, follow the signs for Hankyu Railway when you're transferring from the subway to the Hankyu system.When using the ticket machines at Juso you need to put money in first before you can indicate which ticket you want.The Hankyu line can take you directly to Kyoto (e.g. for a day trip). But be aware the Google maps information for the Kyoto parts of the Hankyu line is generally wrong (e.g. you'll end up on local trains instead of express ones).There's a lot of love hotels around Plaza Osaka, by there's no dodgy characters on the street.","February 18, 2015","23    Hotel Plaza Osaka

1065,"First let me start with the plaudits for the exceptional honesty displayed by the Hotel house cleaning maid whose name i was not able to ascertain inspite of efforts! I was staying with a friend of mine & while going for B`fast i left the key with him & told him to take it along with him.Being an elderly person he probably forgot.In the evening after we returned from the local sight seeing the key could not be found with him!keeping our fingers crossed when we reached our room we found it in exactly the same condition as we left with of course the cleaning having been done!My room partner had forgotten his expensive camera,purse full of money & suitcase open & all these things remain untouched!What a wonderful unique honesty!It would have been better of course if the maid had informed the reception lobby & deposited the room key there who did not know about the incident! This was one of the ever present Japanese character which i noticed as they strongly believe in `Karma`!Otherwise the room was old & scruffy & the bed linen in not a very good condition along with the toilet. A/C was not cooling & it took a very long time to get repaired & with the lack of english knowledge of the staff much more difficult! The B`fast was nothing much to write home about along with the service.","August 9, 2014","23    Hotel Plaza Osaka

1068,"This was the 4th and last hotel our family stayed in during our road trip through western Honshu and Kansai. We had two adjacent rooms on the 5th floor. The rooms were a decent size, especially by Japanese standards, but the views were disappointing: other surrounding hotels, with a glimpse of the river between buildings. Inside, the hotel showed signs of being past its prime: dated furniture in the rooms and tacky white marble counters in the lobby. Also, the hotel was advertised as having a pool, but it turns out that it belongs to the Gold's Gym on the 2nd floor and you have to pay extra to use the pool and children under 16 cannot go in, even with an adult accompanying--our kids were disappointed. When I paid for parking, the concierge pulled out a battered metal cash box. Parking was a hassle: not included with the price and then difficult to negotiate with the attendant in the basement garage, as he wanted not only the hotel's parking receipt but some ticket thing. Even then, they grudgingly allowed us to use one of the larger spaces for our crossover SUV. Overall, the hotel gave the impression of a formerly nice hotel that is ageing and declining to be average.","April 4, 2013","23    Hotel Plaza Osaka

Taxi from Shin-Osaka Station costed nearly 3,000 Yen.Although we requested for non-smoking room on non-smoking floor, we were given a smoking room. The staff were very unhelpful, it was either take it or leave it and forfeiting our payment. They didn't even bother to attempt to help in any way.After we checked out, they refused to provide any assistance to contact our local guide; we couldn't even leave a message at the front counter.My family was so upset with the experience that we didn't even bother to tour Osaka and just proceeded on to the next stage of our journey (Hiroshima).","December 2, 2009","23    Hotel Plaza Osaka

1076,"This is our second visit to this hotel. We were impressed the first time so decided to come back. The location of the hotel is extremely convenient if you're taking the train to go to the airport or another city in Japan. It is not really central for touristic sights. Both times we stayed in Osaka as a transit stop so it has worked out perfectly for us. The service is very attentive and detail oriented. I read some reviews where people think the service is not good. I have to say that my understanding is that people often take their jobs very seriously in Japan, so what might be perceived as ""not friendly"" is actually them being respectful and courteous. The rooms are well-appointed and spacious for Japan. The view is always great. I enjoy the cute pjs and the shower with good water pressure. The club lounge is what sets this hotel apart for us. The space is big with high ceilings. Beautifully decorated with Japanese accents. The service again, is 100% on point. The food for happy hour was easily enough for dinner. The beverages offered are a step above the average. Breakfast featured eggs made to order, which is usually missing from a lounge breakfast. Our second stay was just as wonderful as our first. I highly recommend this hotel and will be staying here again next time I am jn Osaka. ","July 7, 2019","24    Osaka Marriott Miyako Hotel

There is also a zoo near enough next to the hotel and lots of temples to visit. Very good, clean, modern hotel with everything you need nearby.

1079,"The highlight of this hotel is the incredible views from the rooms. Since this is one of the tallest buildings in Osaka (and Japan), the views are breathtaking.Check-in: Because this hotel is so massive, the lobby & check-in felt like you were lining up for airport security. The overall lobby was very bright with dramatic high-ceilings but not many spaces to sit & relax.Service: As English speakers, it was a little harder to communicate with the staff, but regardless everyone was friendly & warm. Even though we are platinum elite at Marriott, none of the perks were offered to us (early check-in, room upgrade, etc).Rooms: The rooms are the redeeming quality of this hotel as the view is spectacular & truly breathtaking. The rooms were very clean & very well maintained.Overall this hotel is a great value. Due to the size of this hotel, be prepared for large amounts of crowds entering & exiting (the elevator wait can sometimes take 10+ minutes) but if love a good view, this is the perfect hotel.","June 27, 2019","24    Osaka Marriott Miyako Hotel

Great location next to Tennoji JR station and underneath the hotel is a huge supermarket and linked to other railway options.

This was especially handy for travelling with family. There is also a small bank outlet to exchange money if you need in the lower ground between the entrance to the supermarket and the train station. The shopping centre across the street is very handy for varienty, also the nearby convenient store (like 7-11) were great for buying buys and snacks. THe hotel room and separate bathroom/toilet were great - super modern and always clean. the only feedback is the carpet were stain. Otherwise a great hotel and hotel staffs were extremely friendly.

The lobby on the 19th floor of the Abeno Harukas building (the tallest building in the country) and guest rooms are on floors 38-57 so good views are guaranteed, if you like that sort of thing!Our room was on the 42nd floor and was very comfortable. Not the most up to date decor but the bed was super comfortable and amenities top notch, including both bath robes and pyjamas. The loo was one of the best we’ve encountered in Japan with a motion sensor which opened the lid when you entered the room and closed it again once you were finished. I’m a total convert to Japanese loos!Breakfast was great, a fantastic choice from the large buffet and egg counter for omelettes.All staff very professional and lovely- there were a lot of them.Hotel is three stops on the metro to the brash, busy and bonkers heart of Hamba and Dotombori- an experience which is totally Japanese.

Very polite staff and very helpful in guiding us throughout our stay. The hotel occupies floors 38-55 and is in the tallest building in Japan. The top has an observatory (tickets are included in your stay) and the metro/JR station is right below the hotel. ,"April 3, 2019","24    Osaka Marriott Miyako Hotel

1098,"We have had a woest experience ever at the hotel. I think this Osaka Marriott does not reserve a name Marriott, considering the hospitality of the staff, communication. Communicating both in Japanese and English did not go through and we truly had an uncomfortable moment. for example, we wanted our luggage to be delivered soon after the checkout, but the hotel front staff, Ms, Lee did not understand our request properly, or delivered our message differently as we have not yet gone out of the Rooms. Hotel location is bad as well and the guidance in Japanese is wrong ina way that people misunderstand the way to the hotel. I think the hotel website should be throughly changed to a correct one. Worst experience ever and we are very sorry for us that we chose this hotel to stay. 最低最悪の経験でした。このホテルは、マリオットと名乗るべきではないと思います。スタッフの教育がなっていません。これまで、マリオットでここまで酷い経験をしたことはありませんでしたが、今回、日本でまさかこのような経験をするとは。","March 30, 2019","24    Osaka Marriott Miyako Hotel

1100,Located strategically in central Osaka this hotel is truly top notch. The level of service from the staff is excellent. Room size is good view spectacular and facilities are well maintained.Food options are plentiful with B1 and B2 full of fresh choices and Floors 12-14 with restaurants.The only negative I can find is not actually that is specific to this hotel but a lot of the hotels in Japan. This is they have a very limited selection of English movie channels and children’s channels. So if you are traveling with children please keep in mind you may be stretched when it comes to choice.That being said a special thank you to Azumi with the concierge team for helping me with a very large box and to organize transport to the airport.I will return to Marriott with my own family in the future.Thank you to the Marriott team.Arigatōgozaimashita,"March 22, 2019","24    Osaka Marriott Miyako Hotel

1101,Had a very good time in this hotel. At check-in they were already waiting for me and was immediately redirected to a staff member that spoke Portuguese in order for the experience to be more fluent and that really impressed me.The room was very large by Japanese standards and very well-appointed. The fitness center was also very pleasant and offered amazing views of the city. The hotel is in the Abeno Harukas building and they offer a complimentary ticket to the observation deck on the 63th floor.

1105,"If you want the wow factor, stay in a premium corner room in the Marriott Miyako Osaka. We stayed here for 3 nights and wished it was longer! The view from our room on the 44th floor was breathtaking day and night, particularly with the double aspect floor to ceiling windows. The room was really spacious, unlike other hotels we have stayed in in Japan, and it had a little sitting area and also another little area with a small round table where I guess you could work. The bedding was great and we enjoyed 3 brilliant nights sleep. The shower and bath were incredible and also had views of the city. The hairdryer was rubbish but that is my one and only criticism of this fantastic hotel. The lobby is very impressive with high ceilings and floor to ceiling windows and it really is an oasis from the madness that is Tennoji below. Upon checkin we were presented with complimentary tickets for the 60th floor observatory which is a must do. We did not have breakfast but did order dinner with room service and it was very nice (there was a good vegetarian menu). The location suited us well with very easy access to trains. Finally, the staff were exceptional and couldn’t do enough for us. I would highly recommend staying in this hotel and particularly in a premium corner room.

Lots of places to eat down stairs, great for families and kids. The hotel itself is very busy with a number of bars and restaurants on the foyer level. Overall very good stay with nice clean room and great views of Osaka. This building is actually the highest in Japan, there is a observation level that hotel guest get free entry on top. The only issue we found was the quality of the food for buffet breakfast was very poor compared to rest of the hotel. ","January 14, 2019","24    Osaka Marriott Miyako Hotel

1107,"One of the best hotels in which I've stayed. The location is ideal - whether you arrive into Osaka via train, bus or plane. The hotel is located immediately above a JR rail station, so if arriving by train, it's only a matter of catching an elevator upstairs from the station. Similarly, you can catch a train from/to the airport, or (better) airport limousine bus which deposits you right outside the hotel.Previously unbeknownst to us, the hotel is the tallest building in Japan, so accommodation there also includes a free pass to the top floor observation deck, which costs money for all other tourists.Our room was perfect and considerably larger than those in other Japanese hotels in which we stayed. Full sized bath, etc. Amenities were top quality. Breakfast was the best hotel breakfast we had in Japan. Finally, service was top-notch. All in all a fantastic stay and I highly recommend the hotel. The only thing missing was a swimming pool :-(.","January 7, 2019","24    Osaka Marriott Miyako Hotel

Our corner room on the 50th floor of Japan’s tallest building gave us spectacular views of Osaka. Concierge lounge was very nice; breakfast on the reception floor was very fun. No spa but the gym has a great view of Osaka and you can watch the sunrise over the city from the window-facing treadmills. It’s worth a visit to the top floor although the option to put on a harness and hang off the top of the building is closed during the winter months.

1112,"It was such a pleasant trip staying at Marriott Miyako in Abeno Haruka once again after my last trip this May. I am addicted in staying this place. The location is perfect for transportation (between airport and all other sightseeing attractions), shopping and eating places around the hotel with variety choices. The staff are very helpful, attentive to details and positive attitude that you can feel from heart.When I came around Osaka Marathon period on 25th Nov, the hotel had a special event for house guests being a part of the race, there was a 'Sky Jog' at 60th floor from 7:20 to 8:20am. A very creative idea, not many guests came up to jog but I did and love the quiet time in enjoying a a very good view at 300m high.My friend was one of the runner and requested to have a late check out as we wanted to have a shower after the run, the staff was very helpful & extended the check-out time for us. An extra nice touch for my next return this December.A bit pricey to stay here but it all worth it after all. Be honest, I wanted to keep this good place for myself but guess more people should enjoy the best services there. Hope it will never changed.","December 11, 2018","24    Osaka Marriott Miyako Hotel

1115,"As we said in our previous review, we visited Japan during this month of November. At this stage, we stayed 5 nights at the Osaka Miyako Marriott Hotel, which is located in the Japanese tallest building. This was the starting point for visiting the Kansai region (Osaka, Kyoto and Nara) and Hiroshima. It is a recent building, very modern, which has commercial areas and very convenient access through the galleries to the subway and train. In addition, this building has an observatory (Harukas 300) at its top, at 300m altitude, to which the hotel guests have free access, and from where you can enjoy amazing views of the city.On arrival at the front desk on the 19th floor, we had a quick check in and we were assigned a top floor room (#5509). We were escorted by a bellman that provided us adequate explanations regarding the room.The room had large windows, with a superb view over the city. Its décor was very modern, had a very comfortable king size bed, AC that worked perfectly and very quiet, which allowed us a great sleep quality. Although the room was not very large, there was enough space for two people to relax comfortably. Complimentary Nespresso coffee, tea and water were replenished daily. The bathroom had very good conditions: electronic toilet allowing Japanese style hygiene in separate space, one basin and separate shower and bath. All necessary amenities were made available in the bathroom and replenished daily with generosity. Housekeeping did a good job.As a Platinum Premier member, we had access to the Club Lounge, which was a grandiose space with a modern and cosy décor, where we had buffet breakfast, which we considered regular, and enjoyed the evening cocktail, where good quality items were made available, although somewhat repetitive.As for us, the service provided by the hotel staff is somewhat patchy, although some elements did a great job. There are, however, some details to improve, causing them to compromise the property rating. For example, on the day of our departure when we had an early flight forcing us to arrive at 6:30 am at the Club Lounge (opening hour) the breakfast was not ready, there was only some bread, some pastries and some cold cuts... It was not a good farewell!We did not comment on other hotel facilities because we did not experience them.Nevertheless, weighing all the experiences we've had, the rating we give to this property is a “short” 5 stars. For those who want to combine modernity, comfort and strategic location, this is the place to stay.","November 24, 2018","24    Osaka Marriott Miyako Hotel

1116,"Very awesome hotel with perfect view, despite the elevator is a little inconvenient (we have to take elevator to the hotel lobby on 19F then change to another guest lift to reach our guestroom).Bell attendants r very friendly and helpful and the room is perfect in all aspects.Front desk staffs were polite too, however, we asked for assistance with restaurant reservation upon check out and got rejected just because we were checking out. I believe that is not appropriate for a 5-star hotel to reject a guest’s request that way, it makes us feel like once we checked out then we are no longer your guest..we are not blaming the staff at the front desk though, maybe that’s the hotel’s policy or whatever.We will still choose this hotel as our first choice when we return to osaka. Overall experience was still excellent.","November 19, 2018","24    Osaka Marriott Miyako Hotel

1119,"Quite simply one of the BEST hotels I have ever had the pleasure to stay in. Located inside one of Japan’s tallest buildings it doesn’t matter which floor you are on you will have a clear unobstructed view of Osaka anywhere. Easy access if you are an international traveller using a JR pass as the hotel is directly above Tennoji on the Osaka Loop line and direct connections from the Shinkansen at Shin-Osaka. The wow factor starts from the moment you walk into the lobby on the 19th floor, which has to be at least 3 stories open plan with cafe, restaurant and lounge all located here. As platinum elite guests we were then taken up to the lounge to check in and the expectations kept being smashed. The lounge again is very impressive, large open space on the 38th with a large selection of snacks throughout the day. Evening meal was also ample and the drinks selection in the evening had something that would cater to almost everyone. Breakfast was a little less satisfying but I still shouldn’t really complain. Our room was on the 51st floor and had stunning views across Osaka, really took my breath away. The rooms are modern and stylish and have everything you would expect in the including an espresso machine for the coffee addicts. The wet room/ shower is also a welcome addition including the option to open the room out to continue overlooking the Osaka skyline (don’t worry you’re very high up so no one can see you!) As hotel guests you are also allowed to jog around the 60th floor in the morning. It may only be allowed from 7-8:15 but it really is worth the early start. The 360 views are spectacular. You are also given a free entry ticket to return after 9pm and see the city at night. Again very worthwhile.There are plenty of things to do around the hotel, Tennoji zoo, shopping in the Abeno Harukas Kintetsu Department Store, the Tsutenkaku district for food and entertainment but with the JR line and subway lines you can get to pretty much anywhere you need to. All the staff were friendly and attentive, I cannot say a bad word against any of them. I would stay here again in a heartbeat. If you have the opportunity then stay in this hotel!","November 4, 2018","24    Osaka Marriott Miyako Hotel

1120,"For our fourth stay in Japan we stayed for 16 nights in this hotel, this time in a Superior room (budget wise more friendly) whilst we previously stayed in Premium Corner Rooms. It was a big smaller but size-wise still very generous and i was pleasantly surprised. I do notice a little bit of wear and tear of the rooms that I did not see previous times. For instance, dirty spots on the side of the bed-side-tables and orange spots on the walls of the bathroom next to the mirror. It made me want to start cleaning. Also the carpet was fraying a bit and had some marks on it and there is a bit of mold starting in the bathrooms. Its not really obvious perhaps, but as i have a bit of OCD when it comes to hygiene and cleanliness i just notice these things maybe a little bit sooner than other people. Still, i am very happy with the hotel and i will stay here next time. The view from the hotel is exceptional. We received water bottles and coffee cups every day. The staff is very friendly. Check-in took ages however, but that was more the ""fault"" of the guests who were arranging all kinds of trips during the check-in process. Staff should have told them to come back later, or go to the concierge counter... there was a long line and people were very annoyed. Its not good to annoy so many guests just to make one guest happy with immediate service. Especially when you come from a 12 hour flight and you are just knackered.I hope these small issues can be solved, just for the sake of keeping this hotel the top hotel it truly is. Its located exceptionally and i cannot wait to come back!","November 3, 2018","24    Osaka Marriott Miyako Hotel

1121,"It was my first experience in a Asian hotel. I had heard the rumors... now I know: not a detail is missed.The views is the first thing to talk about. Floor to ceiling windows with a view of the city that is nothing short of spectacular. Our room faced north and you could see all the way back to Kyoto. Day and night, it was a fantastic thing. We didn't even use our complimentary vouchers for the observatory because the room view was so good.Location is great. We got everywhere we needed to go in Osaka quickly and all from Tennoji Station. Quick walk to Tsutenkaku. 15 mins to Dotombori. 20 mins to Osaka-jo.Service is at least two levels up if you're used to American rack Marriotts. From dropping off out luggage prior to check-in, to taking us through the room to check-out, everything was constantly on point without being oppressive. We had been staying in AirBnBs for the front end of our trip and wanted a more traditional hotel for the final night and they made us feel right at home.Enjoyed the lobby bar (not cheap, but when you're looking out the window at the Akashi Kaikyo Bridge on the horizon with the lights of Osaka around, it works out.Highly recommend.

Facilities all new and although some wear and tear on the furniture is already evident, my room was a truly superb space (corner room, club floor).Check-in went smoothly and quickly but I had to point out my Marriott rewards status and ask for an upgrade or I wouldn't have gotten it.The staff were all attentive, professional, prompt, and polite. Well done. They speak multiple languages. Must apologize for forgetting their names - they deserve recognition. Rena Katsumoto was quite helpful in making my checkout quick as possible. The spacious bath/shower room even had a wonderful view and was well designed with large stone tiles and a large floor to ceiling window - a couples paradise. The shower had an awesome massage function - the strongest/best I have ever used. Water was as hot as could be and came out strong. Very good. The bath had a timer so you could fill it and the faucet would turn off automatically - Marriott provides nice bath salts. The amenities were great. All towells were fresh and fluffy. The bedroom was large for Japan at this price point, and the coffee (nespresso) was a nice service. The bed was not firm enough for my liking and sagged a bit towards the middle but I did have a very restful sleep. They brought me firmer pillows within 5 minutes of my request - very good service for such a large hotel.The lighting is quite well done and easy to understand. TV.... not sure, was too busy or too asleep to really watch but it was large enough for the room, new, and in a perfect location to watch from bed if you so desire.Elevators: for such a high location, I was surprised at the efficiency of the elevators. There are 2 sets (one set from ground floor to lobby, and one set from lobby to rooms) but I didn't wait more than a minute or two at a time - and never felt like I had been kept waiting - quite amazing considering how high up it is. I wasn't particularly impressed with the lobby space or the way it was laid out, and it seemed quite crowded - almost like a train station - designed for a flow of foot traffic rather than for pause and relaxation. The JR Haruka Train to Kansai Airport (KIX) leaves directly from Tennoji JR station, a short 5-10 minute (indoor) walk from the hotel. Takes about 40 minutes to get to KIX, give or take.Finding this hotel from the airport train could be a bit tricky as the station area is quite a busy place and there is another hotel with ""Miyako"" in the name - be sure to go towards ""Marriott."" Best to depart the train platform by the ""Chuo Deguchi"" (Central Exit). Turn left after coming out of the turnstiles and walk about 100 metres to a down escalator (towards ""Abeno Harukas"") - there, you can see a sign for the Marriott Osaka Miyako above the stairway/escalator. Proceed down the escalator as if going towards the Kintetsu department store and the elevator to the Marriott will be to the right before entering the department store and well marked. There are 2 Marriott-guest-only elevators.","September 27, 2018","24    Osaka Marriott Miyako Hotel

Unfortunately it can be lengthy wait around peak hour.Located in the tallest building in Osaka, on top of metro station.

1131,"We stayed at the Imperial hotel at the end of our Osaka trip and when we arrived, we got upgraded to the imperial level, which was very nice and unexpected. We had an amazing view of the river from our room. The room was very spacious and so was the bathroom. I believe our room had around 40 sq m. I instantly felt welcome and comfortable in our room and the variety of bathrobes and PJ’s was a nice touch. The staff was very friendly and super helpful and the room service and food was high standard. There is also a shuttle service going to one of the main train stations. It might not be located in the heart of Osaka, but it is very close to sights such as Osaka castle and Hokoku Shrine. The breakfast buffet was also good. It was quite small for a 5 Star hotel buffet, but it had something for everyone, which was great.

1133,"Look, I'm not saying this isn't a nice enough hotel. The lobby is large and fancy in a severely outdated style, and the rooms are well appointed, but in desperate need of an update. However, it's shortfalls were far too great to justify the ridiculous price.So let's start there. I got serious sticker shock after discovering what I had accidentally paid for this room. After travelling in Japan for a collective month in the past, I knew that rooms in some hotels are charged per person. This visit, staying at only the most luxurious places (for my honeymoon, no less), and extremely conscious of that fact, I noticed that high class hotels tend to forgo that uniquely Japanese pricing structure, and so in a momentary lapse I didn't notice that Imperial was the exception. Therefore, upon arriving at the hotel, I was stunned to realize that one of the most expensive hotels in Osaka was actually twice as expensive as I had anticipated. This was devastating as I had left Okinawa that morning because of an inability to justify the price at the luxury resort there for more than a few days. Of course, this was my fault, but it set my eyes to carefully assess what I was paying for.Now, though I know it isn't strictly illegal, every luxury hotel I have stayed at in Japan has been voluntarily non-smoking. Indeed, no smoking signs are erected all over the Imperial. This did not stop the room I was allocated from smelling so severely of cigarettes that I could not even make it over the threshold. The second room I was allocated, kindly upgraded but no longer on the Imperial Floor (executive level or something like that), smelled distinctly musty but mercifully not like an ashtray, so it was just about acceptable. If I had walked in to this one first I would have rejected it. The room was otherwise fine, but felt as if it had not been touched since the mid-90s. If you like that sort of thing, then fine, but I expect a little bit of modernity in ultra-modern Japan, unless I'm in a traditional Ryokan. I was disappointed to find that the cleanliness was sub-par, as certain very obvious bits of dirt were not rectified between cleanings. Otherwise, nothing in the room deviated from what you would expect in a mid-range international business hotel chain.Location was a real problem. Osaka is a ridiculously well connected public transport city, and the Imperial seems to be situated in the only dead spot. The views are nice enough up and down the river, but it is very difficult to get anywhere else in the city. It is at least a 10 minutes walk to any subway, which when it is raining as it often does here can be a real barrier to enjoying your visit. The only benefit to its location is if you happen to be there for the one week a year when the Sakura are in bloom. A 5-star hotel, as the Imperial purports to be, has certain amenities as standard. It has been mentioned before on this site that the gym and pool are not included, but it was still a shock to be told that, on top of the exorbitant room rate, we would have to pay an additional 50USD or so to access what is even the most basic feature of any hotel. It was, frankly, offensive.One of my favourite things about travelling in Asia is the breakfasts, and Japan is no exception. I have had so many exquisite breakfasts at hotels here that the Imperial offering was a real let down. It was very limited and for the first time ever I left feeling hungry and let down. Despite having paid for it in advance, I skipped subsequent breakfasts in exchange for a bun from the 7-11 down the road. If that isn't a damning indictment, I don't know what is. At breakfast was also the only time I have ever felt discriminated against for being foreign in Japan. Upon entering, we were not offered tea or coffee, not even the a la carte menu options, but just left to our own devices. Others were accorded far greater courtesy and availed themselves of more appetising meals. When I flagged down a waiter to request tea, he came towards us and then caught the eye of a Japanese lady at the next table. He immediately turned to her and pretended never to have seen us. I was shocked, and deeply offended.All in all, a true let down. The cost was sky high and the hotel was a serious let down in many areas. My recommendation is to stay elsewhere.My wife would like me to mention the horrific uniforms. It makes her uncomfortable to witness employees being tortured in such a way.","April 30, 2019","25    Imperial Hotel Osaka

Amenities restocked every day. Toiletries cover almost everything. Room is refreshed every day. The breakfast was delicious with multiple choices attending to all tastes and preferences. Facilities are excellent. The only things I could think of that could improve are TV entertainment (very limited and mostly in Japanese with no subtitles). BBC World is not particularly what one would want to watch on a holiday. The other thing is language. Some staff seemed to struggle with English and most of the written material (flyers, brochures, booklets etc) were only in Japanese. ","March 21, 2019","25    Imperial Hotel Osaka

1142,"As part of our tour of Japan my wife and stayed two nights in Osaka in the Imperial Hotel ( again based on Trip Advisor recommendations). Situated on the riverside conveniently near two subway stations this is a large reasonably upscale 4 star double tower block property with a good range of amenities . Very good fitness and spa centre with a full size ( 25 metre ) swimming Pool that I used whilst staying ( after of course paying the irksome extra charge that all Japanese hotels seem to levy for using these sort of facilities) Our room was a decent size and very comfortable . And one has to say the staff were extremely courteous, friendly and helpful and all aspects of their customer care was excellent. Like most better quality Japanese hotels there was a lot of expensive restaurant facilities that we didn’t use. The exception was the Imperial Cocktail bar ( despite also being pricey) where we did have a couple of drinks . Very nice interior ( a sort of classic Art Deco feel ) and again excellent service made this a pleasant place for a nightcap . In the environs of the hotel in easy walking distance there are also a number of more modestly priced bars and decent restaurants which we took advantage of . Overall we really enjoyed staying at the Imperial would recommend it unhesitatingly and return there again if we ever get chance to revisit Osaka . ","August 30, 2018","25    Imperial Hotel Osaka

1143,"This was the third hotel we visited on our Japan trip, and it was certainly the grandest. In Tokyo and Kyoto we had tiny hotel rooms, so the spacious room at the Imperial felt especially light and open, and we loved it.Arrival: the regular and frequent free shuttle-bus from Osaka station is easy to find, spotlessly clean, and a great way to get out to the hotel. It's operated by the hotel so it doesn't waste your time by stopping anywhere else, and the drivers are immaculately presented and polite, helping with the luggage and showing you to a seat.Check-in: fairly fast, very polite, and good English spoken. Then, we were shown to our room and given a tour of the facilities.The room: big, as mentioned, and a little bit tired. The carpet has seen better days, the paintwork on the wardrobe is scuffed, and the furniture is dated. It's perfectly clean, however, and the mattress and sheets were spotless and very comfortable. There was plenty of space, a good-size wardrobe, a desk with a fairly comfy chair, a couple of armchairs, a window with a view over the river, and - shortly after our arrival - there was a selection of welcome-gift snacks that we enjoyed very much. The bathtub was big, and there were masses of amenities in the bathroom.Internet: fast wireless, worked perfectly.Food: did not try; Osaka is a city for eating out, so this was not a reflection on the hotel's offerings, just our choice of priority.Fitness room/pool: Ah. Yes, this is by far the biggest problem with the Imperial: it's listings on hotels.com, Expedia, etc etc all show a fitness room and swimming pool as hotel amenities. This is an OUTRAGEOUS LIE. The hotel has no fitness room. It has no swimming pool. It is adjacent to a facility where these are provided, but not exclusively to hotel guests, and at TREMENDOUS COST. Seriously: a single visit to these facilities would have cost US$100 for me and my companion. ONE visit. It's grossly dishonest of the hotel to claim these as hotel facilities. When I stay in a hotel and want to work out a bit before breakfast, I do not expect to pay US$100 for the privilege. I can stay in ANY hotel and visit the nearest pay-in gym.Service: Excellent; we ran the staff around getting irons and ironing boards, power adaptors, and we never had the slightest problem with using English, and the staff who responded so promptly to our requests were polite and helpful. Can't fault the staff in this hotel. Not at all.Check-out: Quick and easy too, and the staff member at the desk provided information about how to find and use the limousine bus to Kansai Airport. It was lucky I double-checked this, though, because they were using an out-of-date timetable from 2017, and if I'd turned up for the 15:08 bus as they'd suggested I'd have been very disappointed because it departs at 15:03 now.Overall, The Imperial is extraordinary value for money. I have no idea how they provide this level of service and surroundings for the price they charge. I'd definitely stay here again next time I'm in Osaka, and I'd definitely recommend it to others, but I'd strongly advise them to update all their listings on web sites to make it perfectly clear: the hotel does not have a pool and fitness centre; it is just next door to one.","August 6, 2018","25    Imperial Hotel Osaka

1144,"We arrived in Osaka via the Shinkansen into Shin-Osaka station and transferred to a local train to get to Osaka station. Here you can pick up the hotel shuttle bus (which runs approx every 15m) to get you to the hotel which is about a 10-15 minute ride depending on traffic. A taxi from Osaka station cost us around 1200 yen.Check in at the hotel is 2pm. Staff here is very typical of what we have witnessed on our journey throughout Japan - polite, courteous, respectful and very friendly and more than willing to help.Be sure when you book to request a smoking or non smoking room. We thought we had booked a non smoking so surprised to be allocated a smoking room (17th floor is a smoking floor), which if you're not a smoker, you will find unsuitable. despite this, the rooms are pretty big compared to the rooms we have stayed in when we visited Tokyo, Nara and Hiroshima. The hotel instantly offered a change but as there were no more non smoking double rooms, we were upgraded to a Junior Suite on the 19th floor.....and what a fantastic room this was with ample seating, twin beds, a sauna, safety deposit box, tea/coffee, minibar, separate shower/toilet, TV/wifi and an office desk. Defintely worth booking if you can afford 100,000yen per night!There are also a number of small noodle bars around a 10 minute walk from the hotel that offer up cheap and tasty local dishes if you don't want to eat in the hotel. Of course, the hotel provides four menus; Jasmine Garden (Chinese)/Les Saisons (French)/The Park (Buffet)/Kamon (Open Grill) should you wish to try these. We opted for the local food!

Nothing was advertised when booking about this.We booked this hotel only because of the pool. When confronting the reception about this, they were sorry, and blaimed Expedia (hotels.com) for not giving correct information.We have now read the earlier bad reviews of the hotel, and can see this has been a problem for a long time. The pool seems to be a fake selling point for this hotel. Something they keep doing eventhough they already know of the problem.It would have been easy for them to write a part about the rules and regulation of the pool and gym in the important information on the booking sites. But then they dont sell as good.I would stronly suggest, not to book this hotel, if you come with kids. The hotel is not for families.Honestly, then you should be ashamed of your self.

The hotel sits on beautiful river and a very nice walking or exercise path along the river. Food was good with nice but expensive Chinese and French options on 23 floor. Actually the casual restaurant on 2nd floor was quite nice. The rooms were comfortable and clean, and the hotel is newer than many Japanese options. I would have given a higher rating, but they wouldn’t provide sheets and a blanket for the pull out sofa (which is in the room) unless an ¥8000 fee was paid.

This was a super annoying interaction with them, and makes absolutely no sense that guests aren’t allowed to use furniture that is already in the room without an additional fee. So silly and small minded. It’s a stupid policy. ","June 16, 2018","25    Imperial Hotel Osaka

1156,"Four of us stayed in superior twin rooms for 3 nights. The beds were king singles and very comfortable. The beds in Japan tended to be on the hard side but were very good. The room was spacious and bathroom fine with a great view of the river in front. The shower was excellent - an overhead and a hand-held with bath separate but in same glassed-in section. Staff were courteous and helpful and the free shuttle bus an excellent service. There's great coffee and pastries at the Foodscape bakery just outside in the connecting area. We also tried a couple of the restaurants under the mall and they were also good. There's a handy 7 Eleven at the back of the adjacent downstairs area, selling great snacks, sandwiches and cheap wine and beer, and spirits. A small patisserie opens at 10.30am in the foyer area where you walk across to next door - cakes to die for! We enjoyed our stay here, and the rooms were reasonably priced. Hotel rooms in Japan can be small by our standards so check the floor space when booking. It's worth a few dollars more to get a room above standard size.","May 29, 2018","25    Imperial Hotel Osaka

1157,"Large comfortable room with a nice view of the river which I enjoyed when having breakfast. Services are good and efficient, especially if you want to send luggage to another hotel. Simply call the bell captain. She came within 10 minutes, made measurements of the suitcases and completed the forms (we have 3 pieces). You can use the hotel shuttle to go to Osaka / Umeda (15 min). Or take a leisurely walk to Sakuranomiya station along the riverside (7 min) and take the very frequent JR loop line to Osaka (7 min).This is the second time I stayed at Imperial. I stayed in hotel around Osaka station before, but the room was much smaller at similar price. The room has every thing. There are 2 noticeable improvements since my last stay in 2015 - staff speak much better English and the room has very tasty English tea bags. Imperial is a very good location for cherry blossom season. We missed the best bloom time this year because the flowers opened 10 days earlier than usual. But we still enjoyed the late bloom at Japan Mint which is only 10 minutes from Imperial Hotel.There are restaurants in the OAP building next to the hotel and the two building are connected.I will choose Imperial again when I go back to Osaka.","May 16, 2018","25    Imperial Hotel Osaka

The shuttle to the Osaka Station takes 15 minutes and we are required to catch a short subway to Shin-Osaka which is slightly inconvenient. The most disappointing thing is the fact that we are required to pay ¥5000+ (A$60) for access to the fitness center.

1162,"Stayed here with my two teenage sons for two nights. This was our last stop in Japan and we wanted to spoil ourselves for our last hotel. It was certainly luxurious. The service at check in was great. The bell hop came up to our room and explained the heating and showed us around. We were on the imperial floor (19) and had great views of the river. The beds were so comfortable and the shower was amazing. The bath was great too and we really appreciated a soak after all our travels. The push button lights, drapes and background music was cool as it could all be done from bed! The restaurants were expensive although we had a nice lunch at the 'casual dining' cafe which was actually pretty posh. There is a shopping mall attached to the hotel with not many shops but a convenience store, a cafe and mcdonalds which is handy if you don't want to pay for the restaurants. The location is quiet and very pretty beside the river. It is a short walk to the Osaka loop train station so easy to get around on JR pass (highly recommend getting a JR pass, ours paid for themselves many times over and were just so convenient). My only disappointment was the pool cost extra and there is an age limit of 20 years old. To be able to have a swim would have absolutely topped off our stay. For a five star hotel, the pool should be included and there should not be an age limit. ","April 15, 2018","25    Imperial Hotel Osaka

The guide rushes through the monuments, gives poor and irrelevant information (Ex: ""There was no electricity in the 16th century"" - really?), Also her English was difficult to understand. The trip lunch was awful!The hotel offers a complimentary coupon for two drinks at their bar. It is not complimentary 100 %. You have to pay 4000 yens. It turns out to be a discount coupon.

Gym and pool can only be used by people above the age of 20? I don’t understand this rule and it’s pretty unprofessional. Adding on to that, you also have to pay about $50 USD to use both facilities... terrible and definitely not a 5 star class hotel.

1181,"This hotel was by far the nicest we stayed in during our trip to Japan. The rooms were beautiful and very spacious. Nice touches such as bathrobes (that were changed daily) blinds/curtains that operated by using buttons at the side of the bed, the radio that played through speakers in the room on command and the free daily newspapers that were delivered were very nice. The bathroom was great and the beds were huge and comfortable and cleanliness around the entire hotel was impeccable. The hotel also provide a free, regular shuttle bus to the train station which was ideal for us when we were moving on to Tokyo. There is a smaller train station nearby the hotel, however it is easy enough to travel around Osaka and further afield from - we used this hotel as a base to travel throughout Osaka and Kyoto. The hotel also connects into a small shopping mall which meant shops and restaurants were nearby - we actually ate in two restaurants in the mall next to the restaurant and they were excellent on both occasions serving great and authentic cuisine. The hotel also has spectacular views across Osaka which we enjoyed both in our room and in public areas in the hotel. The overall hotel aesthetic is stunning, right down to the fresh flowers placed in each of the elevators, they have fine tuned even the smallest details.Staff in the hotel were always incredibly friendly and aiming to please - in fact, there was always a few waiting in the lobby area simply to greet guests with a big smile no matter what time of the day or night which was always welcoming and the level of English spoken by staff was the best we encountered in any establishment in Japan which was helpful for us (our Japanese was limited to basic conversation!) The hotel also felt very secure with ample staff working, even throughout the night.There are a few cons; access to the pool and spa facilities was not included and came at an extra charge which wasn't exactly cheap. There are several restaurants and bars in the hotel, mostly located in the upper levels and therefore providing the very best views across Osaka, however they were absolutely extortionate to dine in so we were not able to, even the room service menu was incredibly expensive. It is perhaps to be expected with this standard of hotel, however offering at least one affordable option would have been nice and we would have certainly dined in had this been available. To be honest, I think we got a pretty good deal booking through Expedia and others may have paid considerably more than us to be there - maybe we were out of place a little bit.The location isn't the best in Osaka in terms of being central to attractions and the main transport hubs, however it is certainly easily accessed and a nice area nonetheless and was useful for us a hub to travel from. There isn't a lot to do around the hotel, except the small shopping mall, and is mostly a residential area nearby, but again getting around Osaka from the hotel is easy enough. I would certainly say it is one of the nicest hotels I have ever stayed in and would absolutely recommend it to anyone travelling to the area.","September 3, 2017","25    Imperial Hotel Osaka

From the time of our arrival at the reception till our checkout, all hotel staff was amazingly polite, welcoming and helpful. To name a few- Furuya, Oshita, Onishi, Matsui, were always available to help, go the extra mile to find out and help with the day's itinerary which made a difference to our trip particularly considering our difficulty with theJapanese language!  We had a fantastic view of the castle and the bed was comfortable.The only downside that we experienced was that the air-conditioning system seemed unpredictable but the duty managers helped us with heating and cooling fans.  Mr.Keizo Doi, manager, rooms division was very helpful and caring in this respect.. I would certainly stay here again in the future.","April 28, 2019","26    Hotel New Otani Osaka

We were greeted by friendly, helpful and courteous staff members who looked after us in an efficient, professional manner.

1191,"The hotel was kind enough to upgrade our room, we had lots of space and the room was beautifully appointed, very stylish. Also, since on the 16th floor, it boasted panoramic views. The personal is very friendly and helpful.If you want to visit the Castle nearby, this is the perfect spot. Within easy Walking distance from the train system (350 meters), the Location could not be better for a visit since you just need to cross the river and there you are! Great for runners, by the way, there is a nice course of about 3 míles around the Castle and the moat.The breakfast room is busy in the morning, but has lots of options and is efficiently run.The only small dampener is the fact that some of the communal areas (swiming pool, gym) are not for free, and look tired. This was a little surprising, since all the other areas are so well maintained, but there you have it.","April 15, 2019","26    Hotel New Otani Osaka

1197,"Hotel New Otani Osaka is located close to Osaka Castle and Osaka Business Park area, which is not in Osaka's central area (Shinsaibashi / Namba), where shopping areas and the famous Glico are located. Having said that, connectivity to both central areas and Osaka Central station is relatively easy with Subway and JR Train. Subway and JR Train stations are relatively within easy reach with 5 minute walk for each station. Convenience store is within 2 minute walk, providing easy option to buy food if your hotel deal doesn't include breakfast.Osaka's close distance to Kyoto, Nara and Arashiyama make it a good base for those who want travel to those areas.If you like shopping, the hotel is located more or less halfway between central area and Mitsui Shopping Outlet, which is only 6 subway stations away.Check in was swift and staffs were friendly and polite. The room looks like an old hotel room, but having said that, it is very spacious by Japanese standards. We had a triple room and there were plenty of space left outside our beds and bathroom. The room also had a sofa, which we hadn't had in our previous accommodations in Tokyo and Kyoto.Overall, the hotel's only drawback is it's location, however easy access to Subway and JR Train as well as the big rooms is more than enough to make up for its downside. I would personally recommend this hotel to those who are planning a trip to Osaka","January 8, 2019","26    Hotel New Otani Osaka

The room was spacious and clean with all your usual amenities. The breakfast menu was excellent and offer both western and Japanese foods. The hotel is just around 5 minutes walk to the Osaka Business Park subway which will bring you directly to Shinsaibashi station for all your shopping needs.

1199,"We stayed for a week in hotel new otani osaka and originally booked a superior twin room with castle view. When we arrived to the hotel, they told us that they were grateful we chose their hotel to stay for a week and hence have upgraded our room to triple room. The room had a sofa with two chairs and a table to sit and enjoy some tea with the beautiful view and the bathroom had two basins, so it was really spacious in comparison to our original reservation. We didn't use much of the facilities including the pool, as we were busy exploring osaka and kyoto, but we did request room service which offered a variety of vegetarian food, western and japanese style food (menu was in English).

Even Typhoon Trami wasn't able to affect our enjoyment of the hotel - the double-glazing completely drowned out the sound of the wind and the rain.The staff were extremely helpful and courteous - the only slight issue was that a guest of ours could not use the indoor pool on a rainy day, as her child was less than 18 years old, but the manager compensated by giving our guest all-day free parking during her visit. There is a wide choice of restaurants, albeit dinner is relatively expensive.

1203,"I stayed at this hotel with my family for two nights (two rooms). Actually, I choose this hotel outside the city center for one main reason....its pool.What a disappointment ! You would expect to have a pool to relax, swim and drink few cocktails? But when I tried to access it at 5 PM, it was closed !! and I was told it would open from 6.30 to 10 PM...Why??? End of July the weather conditions are perfect and a pool should be open all day long, not for few hours! So, I came back at 6.30 PM and guess what...I was asked to pay for each of us 2,000 yens! even if not sure I would actually swim. As a guest of an hotel you would expect the pool to be freely accessible, but not at New Otani Hotel. Actually, here everything is charged, even the bad quality coffee sachet available in your room. We then tried to get to the ""garden roof"" hoping for a terrace with a bar... actually your reach a no man's land area...Breakfast is charged at 3,800 per head! For this amount you can get a very good breakfast for 4! in any coffee shop, what we did (Starbucks in across the bridge 200m from the hotel). Don't be fooled by by pictures of the hotel, all is at an extra cost. I traveled around Japan (and the world) and I can tell you can get much better hotels deals for the same amount. We complained to the manager on duty but he would not care less. On the second day I witnessed at the reception another family complaining for the same reason. The only reason why I did not change to another hotel was because we were staying for two nights only.","July 31, 2018","26    Hotel New Otani Osaka

The check in and check out was easy and well done and the stuff was nice and helpful, but they mostly don't speak really good english though. As I said everything was good except for the gym that it's really small and doesn't have the requirements needed to follow a normal gym routine (the biggest dumbbell weights 10kg) but again the staff was really good and the fact that we weren't allowed in the pool and sauna because we have tattoos but had to pay full price (you pay for gym, sauna and pool together)I understand that the country has traditions and I will respect it but if I'm not allowed to enjoy some facilities, do not charge me full price!If they solve the english problem and the gym experience, it will be a 5/5.

There are a 2 twin beds and they were comfortable. In-room safe is big to store laptop, there’s even an outlet in it. Complimentary bottled water is provided daily along with newspaper. Bathroom is quite small but dated with pink wall tiles. We didn’t go to the hotel restaurants since we spent the day away from the hotel. We got our breakfast fixes from 2 nearby McDonald’s restaurants. There is a Family Mart, Ministop, Lawson and Starbucks nearby. The hotel is about 5 mins walk from Osakajokoen station on the Osaka loop line and Osaka Business Park station on the Nagahori Tsurumi-ryokuchi line. The proximity to these stations provide quick access to Umeda area around Osaka station on the loop line; Namba area near Shinsaibashi and Dotonbori on the Nagahori line.Overall, the stay is very pleasant.

1210,"The hotel has a very grand interior and large rooms, however for the price paid I do not believe it to be worth the money. We stayed for two nights and were hoping to use the facilities however it transpires that although the outdoor pool is for summer months only summer does not start for the hotel until July. You cannot even sit outside by the pool in the nicer weather. The indoor pool and gym areas cost approximately 2000 yen for members of the new otani club as well. The breakfast buffet seemed OK although due to my partner having a nut allergy we were only able to have a very small cooked breakfast which cost almost as much as the buffet! It was not even a particularity tasty breakfast. The staff at the hotel try to be as helpful as possible but the facilities after paying such a lot really do not make for a good stay. The location is fairly easy to access by train and is close to the castle which is a plus. There are also alternative (good) breakfast cafes close by.

I could imagine it would have been beautiful with the sakura along the riverbank in full bloom. Nevertheless we still think the premium paid for a room with the castle view was well worth it. Overall the hotel is pretty old and needs a makeover; especially in the rooms. There are some good restaurants in the plaza across the road at Osaka Castle Park (even have a branch of Gram, the popular pancake place). I guess if they have completed renovations, they would probably charge much more! Staff were not too friendly but the check in/out process was efficient enough.

It's mostly quieter than downtown hotel - on a flip side, away from the excitements of city centers3. It's hotel mostly used by business clients and tour groups.The look is old school but still retains its elegance and grandeur.The lobby is vast and ceiling is skyhigh.Lobby boasts its centrally located and cafe-like lounge.Rooms are roomy, suited for a family of three just like us.A 3-bed package offers 33 sqm space with comfy and bright ambiance.Get a room with the castle view is a plus.Daily water bottle is complementary.Mini markets are within walking distance. There's mall-like complex nearby with McDonald's, Family mart and restaurants.No landromat option other than hotel laundry service.Not many train access options nearby other than Osakajokoen that serves Osaka Loop Line. Taxis are frequent.To access the airport you would need to plan ahead with trains or hop a cab to Osaka Station or Kyobashi Station for more direct route.Otherwise take a cab to Shinhankyu Hotel for Airport Limousine Bus.For the running enthusiasts, a morning run alongside the river is fantastic.","December 21, 2017","26    Hotel New Otani Osaka

1223,"They have an excellent staffs that helps you the best that they can. Clean and spacey room, bathroom and hallway. It’s near to Osakajokoen train station too. Outside of the hotel has a lot of food options, near to Osaka castle so if you like to stroll around, you’ll enjoy the view. What I really like about this hotel is they they take note of their shortcomings. If you look at some bad reviews they reply back and they do make changes from the feedback they got from different customers. For me, it means that the management of this hotel does care to each and every customers they have.Keep it up New Otani Hotel Osaka!

1224,"We stayed here in early November and the view from my room of Osaka Castle was amazing, especially at night! Right across the street from the castle grounds.The breakfast buffet was the best I had in Japan. There were western and Japanese choices separated on two stations, which were on opposite ends of the room from each other so it never felt busy even though the dining room was full. They had a monitor for the stations as well so I never saw anything run out. The food was also very delicious and there were so many choices to choose from.

1225,"Huge, quite anonymous hotel which serves it purpose: quite central and rooms are ok but they gave us a non-smoker room which seemed to have become non-smoker very recently because it smell very strong like cigarette. But that was not the worse. We had to leave quite quickly and forgot some clothes and a new Mont Blanc pen in the room. We called them as soon as we noticed the missing items and they confirmed they had picked them from the room and would keep them until our return which was supposed to be one month later. Unfortunately, our second trip was canceled. When we eventually called the hotel to ask if they could send us the items (on our costs) instead of waiting for us to pick them up, they said they had discarded the Mont Blanc fountain pen and the clothes. They had our phone-number, our mail and all our details but they never let us know that they where about to throw our personal stuff away. It is difficult to believe that they would throw a Mont Blanc pen away.Anyway, the minimum would be to give their customer a short notice a few days before discarding forgotten items to let them a chance to get their belongings back, especially when the customer called to signalize the loss and organize the pick-up of the items.","November 10, 2017","26    Hotel New Otani Osaka

1226,"The New Otani Osaka is an upscale, 5 star-ish hotel in a good location. As others have pointed out, it's about a 5-7 minute walk to the subway, as well as a short 10 minute walk to Osaka Castle, which you can see from the hotel. The decor was very nice, and contemporary, but not as modern as other hotels, The New Otani is an upscale hotel with classic furnishings both in the rooms and on the grounds. It's a well kept and beautiful place in a good area. It is situated in a higher end business area, but the backside is where you can find the Osaka Castle, and shops/restaurants leading to the subway. It's a good hub for Osaka.","November 2, 2017","26    Hotel New Otani Osaka

1230,"We stayed as a couple in October 2017. It is situated close to Osaka castle but there are no shops / restaurants nearby. The hotel presents as a huge business type complex. The vast reception area is surrounded by posh shops and a bar and a couple of eating establishments. The main restaurants are situated on the ‘3rd’ floor or the top 18th floor. We had booked into the 3rd floor Japanese restaurant the first night but left without ordering given it was empty and had a poor choice. We went to the Chinese restaurant but were disappointed in the food and, as is often the case in Japanese hotel restaurants, found the wine list limited and expensive. The last night we ate at the top floor posh French restaurant. This was very expensive but had superb views, excellent service and lovely food. The wine list was expensive but with a reasonable choice. The style of food is nouvelle cuisine but was superb. As for the room, we were in 1239 (12th floor, Superior Junior Suite) which was rather dated in style and appeared tired. There were 2 toilets, one which looked as though it was out of the 1970’s. The other was typical hotel style and cramped for a ‘suite’ room. Perhaps we were spoilt coming from the excellent Hyatt in Kyoto and the Imperial Palace in Tokyo, but I would advise choosing somewhere else.","October 7, 2017","26    Hotel New Otani Osaka

1231,We stayed here twice whilst in Osaka wither side of visiting Kyoto. The Hotel is very smart and all the staff were very helpful and we really enjoyed our stays.Top tip before you arrive would be to apply for New Otani membership as this provides you with free access to the swimming pool (which is really nice however would otherwise cost you around £20 per time ) . The membership also got us a free upgrade to deluxe ensuite the first time we visited. The Hotel is also brilliantly located in terms of visiting the castle and Osakajokoen station which allows you to visit different areas of the city via the transport network which is so efficient.Finally if you are hungry for an easy meal out after your flight visit Osaka Jo Terrace as the Good Spoon restaurant (5 minute walk from hotel) served wonderful food at a reasonable price.,"September 26, 2017","26    Hotel New Otani Osaka

Even took extra measure to guide the way to room, introducing places in hotel and where to get ice for cold drinks. Room has a mini walk-in wardrobe that has some hangers, luggage holder and a safe inside. Toilet are well equipped with 3 sets of amenities and hair dryer. Main area has sofa set, working desk, TV, mini refrigerator, some alcohols and drinks, beds. Area is very spacious, 3 (24"" luggage) all opened up at once and there are still plenty of space to move around. Some items in the room can start up slowly like the kettle and the air con. Takes awhile for the kettle to boil water, air con may start up slower and temperature adjust can be slow too. Nearby the hotel, it has Lawson and Starbucks towards Osaka Castle direction, and towards the business district, more stores can be found. Food can be found around the same area. Overall, a very pleasant and comfortable stay here,Pro: Close to Osaka-jo koen station(Osaka Loop Line), those who are using JR pass, this allows you to make full use of your pass, Spacious, polite and friendly staff,Con: Slow start up of kettle and air con.","September 25, 2017","26    Hotel New Otani Osaka

1235,"The New Otani Osaka is a good hotel if you want to stay one night for a visit to Osaka Castle or the Concert Hall. Otherwise, it's location is not particularly convenient to most other areas of the city. The Hotel does boast a great view of the Castle, but the construction of a new Television Station across the street may block what were the best Castle views. The tour boat station and restaurant that faces many of the rooms makes a fair amount of noise with constant broadcast music and boat announcements. The rooms at the hotel are generally large and good. The Junior Suites are very nice. There is a gym and swimming pool, but they are both expensive to use, often crowded by Club members, and inconveniently located. After several stays, I just avoid these facilities. That is unfortunate for guests. The neighborhood doesn't offer much in the way of restaurants for foreigners. Hotel restaurants seemed costly and presented limited dining options. There is a good bakery outlet on the ground floor. We stayed 9 days. and know this hotel well. We prefer to stay in the Shin Osaka area.","August 20, 2017","26    Hotel New Otani Osaka

This hotel is situated right in the midst of the busiest food and nightlife area in town, consisting of Dotonbori, Namba, Shinsaibashi, and countless other food and shopping streets. The entire area is just huge. The hotel itself is a 5 minute walk to the Nippombashi subway station, and less than 10 minute walk to the Namba station. These two stations will connect you to most places of interest. Most of the time, i found using the Nippombashi station more convenient than Namba station, as the former has less platforms and lines to navigate and was therefore easier to use. Google maps was dead accurate as a navigation tool, providing correct routes and timings of trains. Along the street where the hotel is situated, there is a long underground street running from east to west which connects the Nippombashi station and Namba station. This underground street is essentially lined with restaurants and other shops. At street level, there a large number of stairways down to this underground street. There is a convenience store right next to the hotel. I didn't try the ATM in the convenience store, but since it wasn't a Seven-Bank or Japan Post Bank ATM, I don't think it accepts international ATM cards.2) The front desk personnel were fluent in English and quite helpful. I had no problems communicating with them whatsoever.3) There are 3 coin-slot washers and 3 coin-slot dryers on the 11th floor of the hotel. These are all fully automated so you do not need to bring your own detergent. 300 yen will get you a 30-minute wash cycle. Another 100 yen will get you a 30 minute drying cycle. Add more coins for longer cycles.Cons:1) The bed felt a bit stiff. The pillows seemed like the gel-type which may not suit everyone. I had to stack 2 pillows together to achieve a comfortable height for my head to sleep on (I'm a side sleeper). Maybe that's why they provided 4 pillows for my double bed. It got quite hot under the thick quilt cover and i found that I had to turn the air conditioner down to 22 degress celsius to sleep comfortably.2) Not much sound insulation within the hotel itself. Not an issue if you're an early riser though. At 9am everyday, I was woken up by the sound of people opening and closing their doors and it usually carried on until 10am (I guess that's when most guests would have left their rooms to explore the city). At 10am, the contingent of cleaners would go about making up the rooms. Street noise however seemed well insulated from my room.Other Notes:The 'Do Not Disturb' tag is a double-sided piece of magnetic sign which you will find slapped on the back of the door of your room (simply flip over the sign to switch to 'Please Make Up Room').2 free bottles of mineral water are provided every day in your room.A convenient way of traveling to and from the Kansai airport is to use the Nankai Rapid Express train at Namba station. The journey takes less than an hour and costs1270 yen per adult. Each carriage has a small area to comfortably place your luggages.I would recommend these few places to eat at in the vicinity:i) Kushinobo Osaka Hozenji. This restaurant was recommended by a local and was a surprise find. They serve kushikatsu, which refers to fried skewers of just about anything, from meat to seafood to potatoes. It's a nice quiet restaurant where you can get good food without competing with the crowd. Located a few minutes walk to the east of the hotel.ii) 551 Horai's. Their pork buns are really good. They have a sino-Japanese style dine-in restaurant around the sennichimae area above Namba station, a couple of minutes south of this hotel.iii) Kinryu ramen along Dotonbori. Excellent quality and costs only 600 yen per bowl of noodles. There are a few branches along Dotonbori I think. The most centralized branch is very busy. Walk further east along Dotonbori and you will find a less busy one.","October 14, 2018","27    Red Roof Plus Osaka Namba

You are really surrounded by restaurants and more restaurants catering for all taste of Japanese food.

The staff is fluent in English , checkin and out is a breeze. Hotel room is lean and comfortable. Bathroom, toilet and washing basic are all separate. Water pressure and temperature of the shower is commendable because the room is new. Go for the twin bed room because they are much larger than double bedrooms.Double glazing windows shield the traffic noise off pretty well.

1262,"I original booked this hotel for celebrate my 30th wedding anniversary in Osaka from October 17-20,2018 from Agoda. My booking was premium twin room. My son told me that he can join my trip during that period then I went to Agoda and Expedia try to switch the room type to standard triple room but no room was available. I contact Red Roof Plus and ask the staff and she said they have triple room available and that triple room was their last room if I want to rebook I have to pay 4000 Yen per night and total will be 12,000 Yen at the front desk upon arrival. I said ok confirm with them and asked the the total cost of the triple room and the answer was they did not know my deal with Agoda and I just need to pay 12,000 Yen. She didn’t say if I switch to other room type, they will going to charge me more. I want them to send me confirmation for triple room, they didn’t send anything and still the premium twin room on my booking. I called Agoda and talk to the staff because I pay for premium room and Red Roof offer standard triple room and I have to pay extra therefore I switch my room to standard double and I notified Red Roof Plus by phone and online of my new reservation number. I received back 2 welcome messages from them but the 3rd message I received from the same staff called Jeon said I have to pay 80,000 Yen per night and the total will be 24,000 Yen, I was very upset regarding to this because she didn’t mention anything before and I ask her few times for the total cost, her answer was the same and she said I don’t know the deal between Agoda and me. I called the hotel directly and the manager kept saying I have to paid 24,000 Yen. I cancel my booking and I never will go back to Red Roof Plus Osaka again!

1264,"Not the easiest place to get to from the airport (but we did the train, bus would be easier) but it is a perfect spot to base yourself in Osaka. 3 different rail/subway lines at your door, underground shopping tunnels leading to all quickly & easily, the food markets, Dotonbori all at your doorstep, Starbucks for coffee just downstairs. The laundry facilities were very handy, staff all lovely and the hotel is relatively new so everything immaculate. The beds were a great size and soft which is rare in Japan and the room size was also probably a bit bigger than usual in the Premium rooms. We had a great week based at this hotel.","July 13, 2018","27    Red Roof Plus Osaka Namba

1265,"For what we paid this hotel is way over priced. Only positive is the location but front desk staff are unpleasant and not friendly. Hotel hallways are dingy and very worn. Our 10th floor smelt badly. Rooms have a dark dingy feel. They give you couple 'free' snacks but do check expiration dates as we stayed late June and items had expired in March. The hotel is supposedly non smoking with large fine however we someone was smoking and our room and hallway full of smoke. I told reception who came up and smelt it but appologized and said nothing he can do. What a joke! The walls are paper thin and we had some obnoxious loud tourist speaking in mandarin which made things more unpleasant. Overall, very disappointing stay.

Although the room was smaller than most other hotels, all basic items and amenities were sufficiently provided. The location of red roof was unbeatable!

1268,"This is an unassuming little hotel in a very good location close to the major rail junction of Namba and to the liveliness of Dotonbori. The rooms are small, the beds are comfortable, there's a fridge, a few free snacks, and a window view of the rooftops if you're on an upper floor. Everything works well in a confined space, including a very efficient shower.We paid a little extra for the buffet breakfast, offering plenty of western as well as Japanese food.

1269,"If you are after location, then this hotel is perfect for you. It is right about 2 mins away from Dotonbori. Shopping & restaurants all around. It is also very near the Namba Subway Station. Room is just the typical small size for Japan but very clean. The shower is tiny but the water pressure & hot water were very strong so I loved taking a shower. Coin laundry & vending machine also available inside hotel. Didn't avail the breakfast so can't comment there.Service was just average. They provide free coffee in the room, but only had them once since they never refilled them after the first night. The staff don't really do much. If you ask for something they would ask you to go down the lobby to get it yourself. And if you ask for an extra bottled water, they would refuse saying only 1 bottle is allotted per day (what?). There were extremely noisy Europeans or south americans banging on each others door and screaming and laughing like there's no tomorrow outside the hallways on our floor as early as 6am & as late as 1am everyday. When I called the lobby to complain, he couldn't understand me so no help there. Plus our room (#422) was just across the housekeeping staff room and so another source of noise there waking us up very early. Sound proofing is quite bad so just hope you are placed on a quiet floor. Some residents also smoked on the floor, after convincing the staff came up, got shocked that it did smell like cigarettes (it's supposed to be a non-smoking hotel) and did provide an air purifier.Overall, don't expect any special services from the staff but we can still say it was a good stay & hotel. Wouldn't mind staying here again.","May 9, 2018","27    Red Roof Plus Osaka Namba

1271,We stayed three nights in a premium twin room while our friends had an ordinary double. We didn’t see their room but they assured us ours was much better. We had a bit of a view whereas they had a dark room with no natural light. While our twin room was still quite small it was easy to get around and we had a place to put our bags and hang a few things up. We had good bathroom amenities and everything else you need including a safe. Breakfast was the typical mix of western and Japanese choices including eggs made for you a choice of three ways ( OK if you like eggs slightly underdone). We could always find plenty to eat. The location is right in the midst of everything you want to see at Namba and surrounded by shopping and restaurants. It’s extremely busy on the weekends. We had difficulty finding our way in the maze of shopping that leads from the various stations. I had read a lot of reviews about how to find the hotel but none really helped much.The first thing you must do on exiting your train is to find Namba Walk. Look up to the signs at ceiling height. Namba Walk is written in red or ask for directions. Japanese people are generally very helpful. Namba Walk consists of two parallel walkways running east west between Namba and the next subway station. Once you are on Namba Walk look for the exit signs. If you have luggage you need to exit at B 20 ( or was it B22 ) for an escalator to take you up to street level. (Otherwise B 24 or 26 has stairs to bring you up within a few metres of the outside of the hotel). B 20 brings you out almost directly across the road from the hotel. There is a pedestrian crossing right there to get you safely over the road. Hope this helps. ,"April 28, 2018","27    Red Roof Plus Osaka Namba

Around you you have shopping malls(0101, Takashimaya, Daimaru, Namba City, Namba Park), BIC Camera, endless shopping/eating strips/joints (Namba Walk, Dotonburi, Shinsai Bashi), Kuromon Market (The equivelant of Tsukiji Market in Tokyo), and Nihonbashi for ACG fans. I couldn't think of a better location to stay.The rooms were tiny, but then again I wouldn't expect anything bigger because it is Japan... reasonably tidy, but the room could use a good vacume. There were dusts on the floor and threads/furs things stuck on sheets. We stayed there for 8 or maybe 9 nights and it didn't look like house cleaning had vaccumed at all, not even once. However this hotel can seriously up their game on the service front. So I've mentioned about house keeping before... there was also the fact that house keeping can't tell if we're still in the room. I woke up late one morning and was still inside at around 10am, my husband was still in bed asleep and the house keeper, after knocking, opened the door and came in... I was shocked... this is unacceptable. At around 10:30, I decided to head out on my own and leave my hubby in bed so I stepped outside of my room and told the house keeper that my hubby is still asleep inside. She nodded and carried on with her work. My hubby slept till around 11 and came out to meet up with me, we returned to the hotel at night and found the room unserviced... So instead of waiting to check if anyone was still in the room, they simply skipped our room because I told them someone was still inside in the morning. I wasn't happy.Also, the other night we wanted the reception to help us make a call for a resturant booking. It was nearly midnight, the resturant was closed, and they won't open till late afternoon the next day. I 100% expected the gentlement would take down the details like the name of the resturant, phone number and the date/timeframes I was wanting and make the call the following afternoon for me during its opening hours. However he told me it's midnight now, the resturant is closed and I need to come back tomorrow to the reception during its opening time... how unhelpful can you get? Being a tourist on a short visit, your own hotel room is the last place you will be on a typicall afternoon.If I visit Osaka again, I would stay in the same area but I'll definitely look for another place, this hotel will be my last resort.","January 2, 2018","27    Red Roof Plus Osaka Namba

Cannot fault the staff, for the price we paid and ease of access to the metro, dotonbori st and namba walk shopping - wouldn't mind staying here again","December 29, 2017","27    Red Roof Plus Osaka Namba

1284,"The hotel was easy to find. Walk outta Namba subway turnstiles, find exit 16 (leading to Namba Walk underground shopping street), walk til exit B26, step out til street level, walk alongside street with overpass on your left, pass a 24h convenience store and the hotel entrance would be right next door.Check in was at 1430h. So the hotel held our bags for us while we went out sightseeing. Rooms were a little small but everything was cleverly designed to fit into the space. We especially liked the bathroom. Very quaint but surprisingly enough space for a full sized adult.Everything was in good condition, albeit the door lourves were dusty. Looking aside that, the room was well furnished with a safe, an empty bar fridge with 2 free bottles of water and a large kettle.Sleep was good. Beds were firm but not too hard.Not much noise from the road or expressway either.Good place to base yourself out of.Do note that only odd numbered floors have humidifiers and air purifiers. And rooms 20, 21, 22 are larger.","December 21, 2017","27    Red Roof Plus Osaka Namba

1286,"This is the second time i have stayed at the Red Roof Inn and i made that decision mainly based on the Location. As others have said, it is in a great location very near Dotonbori with the train station nearby. Unfortunately it's also the second time I have stayed here and had a non smoking room that smelt really smoky. That's the only reason i am rating them 3 circles this time.To be fair to the hotel, this time, we didn't ask to be moved to another room but i am mentioning it here for others to be aware of. I'm sure had we complained, the hotel would have moved us as they did last time. I think they must have poor ventilation?The room is a typical size for Japanese hotels (small). but if you're only going to be there in the evening, it not a big deal.The rooms are modern and well appointed, they were tidied everyday, and they were clean.Staff were helpful and friendly but english language capabilty was not strong.A pleasant stay.","December 6, 2017","27    Red Roof Plus Osaka Namba

We stayed through Super Typhoon Lan & even before the typhoon clipped Osaka the wind noise coming from the Window was terrible! You would be forgiven for thinking the window hadn’t sealed correctly or was slightly ajar but there wasn’t any draft. Avoid the breakfast, it’s not very good & very expensive for what it is. It’s much cheaper to go over the road to McDonalds, in fact it’s significantly cheaper!Hotel staff were friendly but the standard of English spoken even during the day was rather low, the night staff hardly spoke more than the basic greetings.The good point is that everything is on your doorstep.

1291,"I am a Platinum Ambassador member and always try to stay at Intercontinental Hotels when I travel. We enjoyed our stay and the service was friendly and what is expected of the Intercontinental brand. Both our dinners in the restaurant were very good. We didn't do the b/breakfast as we don't eat much for breakfast so for us its a waste of money! All the staff were lovely and welcoming. We are a family of 4 (16 and 12yrs old children ) Unfortunately there were two issues which didn't impress us at all.1. I understand when stay here you expect to pay more for drinks and food, that I accept BUT 1200 yen (Around $15-16 Aus) for a latte' is not a little more it's a rip off!!! What a joke.. We didn't go back for another coffee 2. As a platinum member I'm entitled to an up grade. However we couldn't have one because the upgraded room only had one bed.(This always happens at every Intercontinental) So I was use to it but the bit that left us so disappointed was at check out they had not only charged us for the extra bed (5500 yen per night) but also a extra person charge of 1500yen per night for my teenager daughter! Double dipping at it's best! I kindly asked to have one of the charges taking off the bill because I had not received an upgrade but was told no. Instead they gave me a lousy 10000 points which is of no value at all. We will be traveling to Osaka again next year but we all the extra charges I don't think we will stay here again.

A special mention of Trung who helped us make a booking at Intercontinental The Strings, Shinagawa. We changed our Tokyo accommodation as we were so impressed with Intercontinental Osaka that we decided to stay with them in Tokyo as well. Would definitely recommend using pool and spa area, it is beautiful, relaxing and immaculately clean and helps revive after busy day in Osaka. Really can’t recommend this hotel highly enough.

The only quibble I have is that the food/drink could be a little less expensive - £10 for a cup of coffee seemed a bit steep but perhaps that's what the going rate is for coffee in hotels in Osaka.

Special thanks to Miho-San, Emi-San and Raymond.Upon arriving KIX airport, we took airport limo to New Hankyu Hotel bus stop, the hotel sent a hotel car to meet us at the stop and take us to hotel free of charge. Check in was smooth with no wait. When I checked in again after returning from Kyoto, the luggages I left behind in Osaka were already waiting for me at the room. Received free drink vouchers as Spire Ambassador benefit.

1311,"2 night stay at IC Osaka after a week snowboarding in Hokkaido. Pre-stay communication was excellent and the complimentary pickup and dropoff at New Hankyu hotel (airport bus stop closest to IC Osaka) much appreciated. It’s only a 1 min drive, but 400 metres can be quite far while dragging luggage or little people on busy sidewalks.Hotel is connected to Grand Front Osaka (a fancy mall) and a short walk to the JR Osaka or subway (various lines). There are plenty of shopping malls and the usual chains around IC Osaka so there is no real need to go to Namba (4 stops JPY230) unless you really want a selfie with the glico man. Being a major transportation hub, lots of famous restaurants have a branch at Umeda.Reserved a deluxe and got a one level Ambassador upgrade to a premium king which is like a junior suite (FYI they do not have twin bed set up for the premium rooms). Spacious and modern, even had a walk in wardrobe. Local honey sweets in turn down service was a nice touch. Bathhouse was lovely, with indoor Japanese bath and 2 saunas. Totally empty when I visited at around 3-4pm on a Saturday. English instructions on the lockers for those not familiar with bathhouse etiquette. HOWEVER, it is not possible to wear the yukata between your room and the bathhouse (or at least I would feel uncomfortable doing so) since you need to change lifts at the lobby area to get to the bathhouse. While I typically dislike large hotels, it never got too noisy or busy in the lobby and public areas (unlike say IC Bangkok). The high ceiling definitely helped. Not sure what scent they use in the public areas but it made the hotel smell and feel classy. Definitely a five star experience.","February 7, 2019","28    Intercontinental Hotel Osaka

1312,I'd like to give this 4.5 but didn't have the option! We'd just come from Hotel Gajoen in Tokyo so its a difficult benchmark. The room was very practical but just lacked the open layout and quality finishes we had at the Gajoen. Some of the furniture looked a little tired. But really this is just nitpicking. The room was very comfortable for a family of four and the washer and dryer were very handy. The location was very good and we had some first class service from the chief concierge Asako. My son broke his wrist ice-skating while we were there and Asako was very helpful tracking down a clinic for us to go to. Asako and the team were very supportive and the help was much appreciated. The hotel is well located very close to the station with lots of nice places to eat nearby. Would stay here again if we came back to Osaka.,"February 1, 2019","28    Intercontinental Hotel Osaka

1315,"Residence room with separate living area was spacious and functioning, fully equipped and good value. Location is conveniently close to Osaka station, yet would need 300-400 meters walk through office building/mall to get to the platform and shopping or grocery anyway. Grand Front Osaka mall in which it sits on feel a little too quiet and uninteresting for tourist, and not so much variety of food and eateries. Early check-in offered without request was a great uplift after arriving from overnight flight. However, there was some mix up on check-out rate which was later solved. All in all, great comfortable stay, but may explore other places more central next time, may be near Shinsaibashi. ","December 30, 2018","28    Intercontinental Hotel Osaka

The service was very efficient and was communicated clearly as to when the jacket could be picked up.The club floor services also were very convenient and the food available at pretty much most hours of the day were excellent.We thank you again to the friendly and helpful staff and look forward to visit the hotel again in the near future.Thank you so much!

1318,"My wife and I had a vacation in greater Kansai Area two weeks ago we had great pleasure of staying at InterContinental Osaka for 3 nights . This was the second time we stayed at IC Osaka; the first time was 10 months ago in January we stayed there for 5 nights. Our first stay experience was so delightful we managed to stay again at IC Osaka to celebrate our Pearl Anniversary. Again this time was an exceptional experience making our trip to Kansai and our special occasion the most memorable. We took the non-stop Airport Bus from Kansai Airport to Hotel New Hankyu (it runs every 15 minutes and the travel time is one hour) from there it took 5 minutes to walk to IC Osaka. As the JR Osaka Station is within 5 minutes walk from the Hotel we also used it as the transportation hub to explore Kyoto, Nara and Kobe. Taking a ride on the Sagano Romantic Train should be on the top list for everyone exploring Kyoto at Autumn Foliage Season. It is convenient to take the Special Rapid Train from JR Osaka Station to JR Kyoto Station (the travel time is only 30 minutes) and then take a connecting train to JR Saga Arashiyama Station. The Sagano Romantic Train terminal Saga Torokko Station is within walking distance from the JR Saga Arashiyama Station. We also took a shuttle bus from the JR Osaka Bus Terminal, which is located at the ground floor of the JR Osaka Station, to Kobe-Sanda Premium Outlets which was acclaimed to be the largest outlets site in Kansai region. We spent almost the whole day for shopping in this Outlet. We stayed at a Corner Suite. The room was spacious and well appointed with a separate sitting room furnished with a large writing desk, a 3 seater sofa, a bar corner equipped with Expresso coffee machine, water boiler, full bar kit and a tea table placed on top of a massive stone for making tea. The Corner Suite was embedded in floor to ceiling window walls so the room had great view. Looking out from the room the view of the Osaka city, the riverbank and skyline was amazing particularly at sunset time. The elegantly designed bathroom had a spacious walk-in rain shower cabin which also had an island full sized bathtub and a separate toilet room. The bathroom was well stocked with high quality toiletry and amenity kit.  The Club Lounge is located at 38/F. It has a nice and comfortable ambience. With much regret we were out of Hotel most of time so we only had time to enjoy the evening cocktail which had buffet of good assortment of cheeses, nuts, cakes, snacks. Hot canapés were served to our table. The extensive drinks list included champagne and a good selection of wines. All the staffs working at IC Osaka were great; they are professional, courteous and attentive to the small details. We received exceptional good services at the Club Lounge, the restaurant, the bar and the Luggage Room. We also received great services from Ms. Huang and Anna at the Front Desk.  I would like to express my sincere gratitude to the dedicated concierge team Machi Kimura and Yukari Imai who helped me plan for our trip to Kyoto and arrange tickets for the Sagano Romantic Train few months before we arrived in Osaka. They also took the extra efforts to exchange the train tickets to a more suitable time slot. Without their in-depth knowledge, professional services and attentive attitude it was impossible for us to accomplish such an enjoyable trip in Kyoto and Osaka. Such professionalism coupled with services oriented and customer-mania companywide management philosophy are indeed make InterContinental Osaka so special and outstanding. No wonder it is rated the best hotel in Osaka in the past years. When we return to Osaka in the future I could not imagine staying anywhere else.","December 11, 2018","28    Intercontinental Hotel Osaka

We must say that their rooms are comfortable, spacious (quite the luxury in Japan) and comes fitted with amazing bathrooms (love the dual, strong showers!).The buffet breakfast has a wonderful spread and if you're fortunate enough to get window seats, breakfast with a view.Jerome (Director of Rooms & Guest Experience) certainly embodies his job title to a tee! My husband and I always come away from a chat with him feeling like valued guests. This time, we engaged with the Concierge team for recommendations for Sake Breweries and Teppanyaki recommendations and the above and beyond Chief Concierge, Asako, wow-ed us with her customised recommendations.Thanks to all here for another fantastic stay and we look forward to our next visit to Osaka!","December 4, 2018","28    Intercontinental Hotel Osaka

1323,This is absolutely one the of the best places to stay in Osaka. The rooms are exceedingly large. About 45 sq. m. Service is top notch. The location is great too. Hotel is connected to Grand Front Osaka and a 5 minute work leads you to Osaka station. The rooms are just beautiful. Ask for the river view. The concierge is outstanding and always ready to meet any requests. Located in a nice quiet area. We had an opportunity to stay in two different rooms. One facing the office buildings and another facing the river which was nicer. ,"November 14, 2018","28    Intercontinental Hotel Osaka

1324,"We booked a deluxe twin room and added an extra bed for my son. The room was still roomy and spacious, unlike most hotel rooms in Japan. Service was excellent! The concierge recommended different restaurants based on my preference even prior to my arrival, and made the bookings for me. The hotel also arranged for ""car"" pick up from New Hankyu Hotel (Kansai airport bus' first stop) to the hotel so we didn't have to haul luggages across streets, and up and down escalators. They also arranged the same service when we left. There is a Jap bath house at the hotel which you can use to get a flavor of Jap bath. The hotel made our Osaka stay very comfortable and easy. Location is convenient, within close walking distance (8m) to Osaka station, Umeda station. Lots of shopping, restaurants around the area. One would be happily entertained just staying in this area.

1326,"InterContinental is more often than not my go-to hotel chain; their properties strike just the right balance between luxury and practicality. For our visit to Kyoto I had chosen to stay at the nearest InterContinental in Osaka, which although still reassuringly priced, was not quite as eye-wateringly expensive as the five-star properties in Kyoto itself. Staying at the IC also offered an excellent opportunity to use my yearly Ambassador complimentary weekend night certificate. Located in the Grand Front Osaka complex, the InterContinental was opened in 2013 and occupies the top floors of the third tower in a series of four. We arrived by taxi from Shin-Osaka Station, not to be confused with Osaka Station which is conveniently within the same complex as the IC and serves as the departure point for regular trains to Kyoto. We were warmly welcomed at the ground floor lobby where bags were taken quicker than I could say ‘don’t worry’ and we were escorted to the 20th floor main lobby and reception. A few taps on the keyboard had us being escorted up another eight floors to the Club InterContinental lounge, where we were invited to take a seat and enjoy afternoon tea whilst check-in formalities were completed. This was a pretty seamless welcome, although could’ve been improved by avoiding the stop at the main reception. The Club lounge is a relatively small simple rectangle, with a dining area directly behind reception, bar and buffet to the right and lounge seating beyond. A meeting room is available adjacent to the dining area. Towards the rear of the lounge and adjacent to the TV area, a small library provides a focal point to the otherwise somewhat bland design. Large picture windows provide a view across the Yodo river towards Itami Airport in the distance. Whilst it’s a comfortable space, the ambience was more upscale airport lounge than some other Club InterContinental lounges offer, an impression augmented by the regimented arrangement of seating and rather odd choice of at times loud background music. One of the washrooms within the lounge housed a shower, a useful feature for those arriving early in the morning with no room yet available. Afternoon tea was an entirely waiter-led affair and consisted of a good range of daily changing sandwiches, sweet and savoury pastries, all presented neatly and with the thoughtful addition of cold towels. Declining the offer of an escort, we headed around the corridor to our spacious Club InterContinental room. Whilst not a suite, the 50 square metres of space was more than adequate for a four-night stay, and offered sweeping views of Osaka, a skyline that is generally more pleasing the higher you look. The Umeda Sky Building is particularly ugly. Decorated in much the same style as the rest of the property, the only oddity was the lump of rock in the middle of the room, atop of which sat a Japanese tea set (with accompanying sweets replaced daily) and within which were the drawers for the adjacent desk. Certainly a unique feature, if not a little out of place. This sort of custom design was evident throughout the room, and certainly added to the practical yet stylish nature of the layout. For such a modern hotel (complete with the usual James Bond-style control panels for lighting and window coverings), the lack of any USB ports in the room is unforgiveable, although power sockets were thankfully plentiful. To the left of the entryway, a modest walk-in closet housed most of the usual hotel paraphernalia, with the exception of a portable suitcase stand but with the addition of kimonos.Built into the side of the closet facing the room, a glass-fronted cabinet housed the minibar and Nespresso coffee machine. The was no Ambassador mineral water beyond the usual complimentary IC-branded bottles; I often find that properties skimp on this benefit, although I assume a branded bottle would be available if requested. The Ambassador fruit plate was waiting on the ledge adjacent to the TV, whilst an assortment of sweets and snacks were placed on the desk; I have no idea what these were as I couldn’t get past the eccentric packaging. As far as furnishings went, the single armchair (or should that be lounge chair, given it lacked any arms?), although in keeping with the interior design, did not offer much in the way of comfort; call me old fashioned but I’d have liked two proper armchairs with a table between them. The juxtaposition of the sprung wooden floor alongside the inlaid carpet was a swish design element. The marble-clad bathroom was the room’s strongest feature; a huge walk-in rain shower (in the same wet room as the free-standing bath) offered the same amount of force as I was hoping not to feel from an earthquake. The usual Agraria amenities were available in abundance, and a separate room to the side housed the obligatory Toto.Breakfast each morning was taken in the Club lounge and featured an extensive à la carte selection of both Japanese and Western options, along with a moderately sized but well-provisioned buffet. I found the size of the dining tables to be a bit skimpy, although it was generally better to eat in the dining area than at one of the tables in the lounge area; the bucket seats there (with round cushions) were impractically low and downright uncomfortable. Practicalities aside, the breakfast was of a very good quality, and the accompanying service was professional without being overly deferential. The lounge looked its best in the evening, when another buffet of fruit, cheeses, cold canapés, breads, savoury and sweet snacks was complemented by a rotating selection of hot canapés delivered table-side. The extensive drinks list included the pleasant Louis Roederer Brut Premier champagne.When it came time to check-out, all formalities were taken care of in the Club lounge. To ensure complete symmetry of the check-in and check-out experiences, we were reluctantly forced to indulge in afternoon tea just one final time before heading downstairs to a taxi to Itami Airport. InterContinental Osaka represented a solid choice as a base for exploring Kyoto, given its location just 30 minutes from the city via the JR Kyoto Line’s Special Rapid Train from Osaka Station. Whilst the property’s design is not necessarily to my personal taste, and the obligatory two lift journeys to reach the room a multi-use tower block necessitates gets wearisome, the overall experience was as comfortable as you could wish for.","October 14, 2018","28    Intercontinental Hotel Osaka

1345,When I book the Westin I expect Starbucks in the room. Not only is there no Starbucks in the room there no Starbucks in the Hotel. Closest Starbucks is 25 minutes away. Which leads me to point out that everything is min 25 minutes away by shuttle or by walking. The coffee in the room is so bad I wouldn't give to my worst enemy. I keep reading how great the location is... sorry it's not... and next to means a couple blocks away not 25 minutes. Overall disappointed in location and the one of the things I really look forward to staying at a Westin. The other issue was a trainee was checking us in at the front desk. It took beyond forever to just give us two room keys. It was painful to watch... almost as bad as walking 25 minutes to starbucks.,"July 11, 2019","29    The Westin Osaka

1346,"We took a red eye flight and was dying to take a nap before exploring the city. The front desk was able to upgrade us to a high floor and let us have the room at 11am. The gesture was very much appreciated! The concierge was also very patient with my multiple requests (and changes) on restaurant reservations. The rooms are very large (for japan standards) and we had a great view of the city. Housekeeping was spotless. Limited english channels on TV but that was not a problem with me as I could easily connect to netflix with the hotel internet. Although the hotel was slightly further away from the train station, there are frequent shuttle buses available. As the weather in May was excellent, we didn't mind taking a walk as well. We will definitely stay here again the next time in Osaka. Thanks so much for your hospitality!","June 18, 2019","29    The Westin Osaka

1347,"The hotel is located a 15 min walk from Osaka & Umeda stations & also provides a free shuttle that leaves at regular intervals (timetable us clearly posted in the lobby & as with Japanese precision leaves on the dot as advertised). Check in was fast, efficient & we warmly greeted & allocated our rooms on Club floors in quick time (as Platinum members which comes with a range of privileges including use of club lounge, pool & health club facilities). The rooms are huge by Japanese standards & the bathrooms are luxurious & well appointed (with the requisite amazing auto toilet seat that does everything for you!) Overall decor is a little dated but still modern & streamlined in accordance to Japanese sensibilities. The Westin heavenly bed is super comfortable & the luxury high thread cotton sheets are luxurious. The “sleep help” consisting of a small roll on bottle of lavender oil placed next to the bed is a nice touch. The executive lounge is small but adequate & the food offerings are also sufficient & regularly topped up. Breakfast is ok (the main cafe in lobby level serves a much wider variety but the lounge is quieter & exclusive). Afternoon tea is a delight - served individually consisting of a range of mini cakes & petit fours. Evening cocktails are also ok - a small variety of tidbits to have with pre-dinner drinks. They serve Jacquard champagne as well as a nice range of Japanese sake & plum wines. The pool & health club was excellent. Japanese style bathing facilities with a hot soak pool (segregated in the male/female change rooms) & very good sauna. The gym though small had sufficient equipment for a thorough workout. The outstanding part of this hotel is their service. Every staff member we came across were warm, friendly & genuinely keen to help. This was consistent throughout the hotel so kudos to the management for this. We stayed 3 nights & thoroughly enjoyed our stay. I would highly recommend this hotel - I realized past reviews commented about smoking room issues etc but I honestly did not notice any excessive smoke smells or even anyone smoking! Look forward to returning to this hotel when we visit Osaka again. ","June 7, 2019","29    The Westin Osaka

1348,"Booked a room online and requested for a baby crib. When we arrived, they told us that we have a smoking room! My sister who also has a baby, called to book her room and also requested for a crib - still she was given a smoking room. Hotel was fully booked so we couldn't switch rooms. Ended up having to go to a different hotel and wasted our entire first day. What's worse is that the Westin staff actually tried to convince me to take the smoking rooms with two babies. Their only explanation was that their website didnt give people to select smoking or non smoking...clearly they did not read my special request and used common sense.Oh ya and they also charge to use their gym and pools...even though we're paying $500 per night.Not impressed.","June 7, 2019","29    The Westin Osaka

1350,"This was a family trip to Japan with the first leg beginning in Osaka to tour the sights of Osaka, Kyoto, and Nara. We booked out stay through our credit card's points for 4 nights. The hotel itself is near the Osaka Station but it still is about a 10-15 minute walk to get there (through a tunnel and then a large shopping center with good food options). If you have a good amount of luggage as international travelers often do, then it could be hard to lug the bags over since there aren't that many ramps around.The hotel itself is a little bit of a throwback design wise and the rooms are a bit tired and in need of a facelift. The rooms are non-smoking, but there's always a hint of smoke in the air in this hotel.Perhaps the most unexpected part of the stay is that KIDS UNDER 18YO ARE NOT ALLOWED IN THE POOL. This is a tough one because it is neither on the US Westin website profile nor was it on the Chase Rewards Portal. It just says that there is an indoor pool and fitness center. Furthermore, if you are not Bonvoy Gold, then there is a steep charge. It should be mandatory that these details are spelled out since they are well out of the norm of other Westin (Marriott) properties. We talked with the manager Mr. Bito, who was apologetic but inflexible.The sights in and around Kyoto require a bit of walking and hiking which is great, but it would be nice to be able to take a dip. As a hotel and chain that is billed as ""family friendly,"" we found that not to be the case. We would NOT have stayed here had we known that this was going to be their policy.So in the end, we would have found one with a pool free and accessible to children, and one that is closer to the station. Perhaps next time we will give the Intercontinental a try.","May 25, 2019","29    The Westin Osaka

Luckily, the 10+ minutes walk to the Station was not too bad and guests could also take advantage of the hotel’s complimentary shuttle transfers. Interior decor of the hotel was conventional. Our room was really big with a large bathroom. Everything looked clean though room furnishings and fixtures needed updating.

1355,"Just finished a week trip to Osaka and I chose to stay at Westin Hotel Osaka. The hotel was conveniently located at Kita near JR Osaka Station and there was a shuttle bus service between JR Osaka Station and the hotel. It could be reached on foot by just a five-minute walk from Grand Front Osaka, which was adjacent to JR Osaka Station and Daimaru, if you missed the shuttle bus or after 10pm when the shuttle bus service was over. Though the hotel was 25 years old already, the upkeep was satisfactorily maintained. The room I stayed was Deluxe King and it was quite spacious compared to other local Japanese-branded hotels. The service was good and sufficient to our needs. The staff at front desk, concierge and service express were all very nice and courteous. Especially the concierge staff was extremely helpful in handling my request for the reservation at a restaurant nearby. The service express staff also handled well to our two parcels being sent to the hotel. My kid expressed that Westin Hotel Osaka was a good hotel to stay and we should stay there again next time we visit Osaka. This is also our intention. It’s worth to know that there is an airport limousine bus stop in front of the hotel entrance, which is good and convenient to those who have a number of luggages like us. There was a drawback that came to my astonishment was the use of swimming pool, which was not complimentary to the hotel guests.","April 28, 2019","29    The Westin Osaka

On arrival at The Westin Osaka for our first stay, we were upgraded to a high-floor (22/F) room with an unbelievable view of the Sky Building. We were so excited and grateful for the upgrade—a lovely room that was both spacious and well maintained. While the hotel is not far from the Osaka Station (about an easy 10-minute walk), we liked that it offered free shuttle bus service at 15-min intervals, which was really convenient.

Bath includes Japanese style bathtub and the beds are very comfortable and blankets nice and warm.

There is a frequent shuttle service to the JR Osaka Umeda train station which is very convenient. There is a good selection of shopping malls at the vicinity of the train station. Just opposite the hotel is a 7-11 - making it easy to get any snacks or drinks. Breakfast could be better - the breakfast spread is quite limited.

The hotel itself is nice, nothing amazing but very well kept, the rooms are a little outdated but in very good condition. The beds are very comfortable, AC works good, great water pressure and of course hot water. There is not much activity near the hotel so if you are looking for action, stay closer to Namba.

It was our wedding anniversary and my husband had arranged with the hotel to surprise me by decking out our room with 100 balloons and a bouquet of flowers. The room we booked was not the refurbished one, but it was still clean and big with a very comfortable bed and great amenities. The only downside to the hotel is the walk to the train station and the fact that there is only one airport shuttle a day that goes straight to the hotel. In the hot and humid summer Japan, the walk is simply unpleasant. However, you can always catch the airport shuttle which comes every 15mins. The hotel bar is smaller and less entertaining compared to The Hilton which is my de facto hotel in Osaka, but for the bigger room, i will stay in The westin again.","August 27, 2018","29    The Westin Osaka

1379,"The room size is average for Westin hotel, but it should be considered large by Japanese standard. And the room was clean. The hotel staff was friendly. But the room rate was on the high side for what you get.The location is close or next to Umeda Sky building, so it was convenient for me. But it was away from city center, away from central station for subway or train. So the location may be good or bad, depending on your taste. It is quiet and a bit isolated.There is a 7-11 store across the street from the hotel.Restaurant: The hotel has restaurants, but the prices are too high ($ 40 at least, and up in most cases). Although the prices are high, it did not taste all that great. Fortunately, there a food court at Umeda Sky building (B1 floor), and the food prices are cheap and the quality is acceptable. The problem was that there was no place to eat for breakfast, since the food court in Umeda building is not open for breakfast. You can eat at the hotel - breakfast buffet (the only choice). But it was about $38 for the breakfast. It was too expensive for me for breakfast, as I usually eat light breakfast. The hotel should provide breakfast to hotel guests at reasonable price. The hotel seems only to care about making money from people. If you don't want to pay $38 per person, where do the family have breakfast?","July 25, 2018","29    The Westin Osaka

1380,Recently stayed in The Westin Osaka with my families for almost a week. We stayed at the Japanese suite which is best stay we have in Japan. Not only it's roomy but also the experience made kids so exciting. Good fit for a family of 5 and still provide spaces for socializing.Great service and great location (free shuttle to/from Osaka station in every 15 mins). Mr. Nagasuna (hotel manager) is very friendly and provided us all supports required. He even arranged a birthday cake for my wife and kid during their birthday :)We love the hotel and would definitely stay again if back in Osaka.,"July 24, 2018","29    The Westin Osaka

1382,The Westin Osaka is a nice hotel well collated in Osaka.The staff is nice and hospitable.The only remarks is relative to the food - nothing special was noted - there is an attempt to serve Italian cuisine at a relatively expensive price but the taste is just not there perhaps because of the products.Last the tv stations available in foreign languages is even lesser than Tokyo - in this day and age it is not normal.,"June 28, 2018","29    The Westin Osaka

1383,"First up - finally,a hotel that does have demarcated bathroom space and no see-through private areas! It may be a personal peeve, but I just don't get this 'modern' concept and it was a relief to find a 'normal' room. The hotel is big, part of the Umeda Sky building complex, walking distance from the JR Umeda station and shopping. Very good service overall, though paying for gym facilities when you are a hotel gues just beats me. The one thing that hugely disappointed was the Chinese restaurant that was cited as a 1 Michelin Star... another review of that!I'd pick this hotel again.","June 20, 2018","29    The Westin Osaka

1385,"Location: Within the vicinity of Osaka/Umeda Station area, but comfortable walking takes about 10 minutes at least. Shuttle buses are available at scheduled times and very efficient. Taxi is easily available, and two convenience stores (7-Eleven and Lawson) are nearby. Room: Comfortable for two people, but added an extra bed for another adult and it becomes rather tight. Given top-most floor due to my SPG Platinum status. No room upgrade to a bigger room or suite this time. Amenities were topped up generously. Quality of bed and pillow is as per standard.Service: Excellent! front desk was efficient, concierge was accommodating, and service staffs were faultless. This is one area where everyone seems to excel at.Meal: This is where Westin Osaka definitely fail to live up to its name. For 4 straight days, no change in menu. Selection was poor, but taste is decent. I had better breakfast selection at Sheraton Miyako Osaka, and Westin is supposedly a superior brand than Sheraton.

1386,"Stayed at The Westin Osaka for a couple of nights during April and overall, it was a nice short stay.Location is good, about 10min walk to Osaka station or 7-8min via Shuttle bus (takes the long route).One thing I really like about this hotel is its structural design, the lobby, rooms, even room keys all have a classical and contrasting tone to it, which really suited me.Check in was easy and we were upgraded to a Luxury Room. This was a decent sized room (45sqm) with fantastic night views of Osaka. Compared to Hilton Osaka across the road which we stayed the week before, the room was only half the size... (90sqm+ at Hilton)The lobby staff was very friendly, took our luggage up to our room and showed us where everything was.As a gold member, I was only entitled to a one category room upgrade, without any other entitlements so there isn't much else worthy to comment on. Hopefully, as a Platinum member now, I can enjoy more benefits staying at The Westin in the future.","June 9, 2018","29    The Westin Osaka

1387,This is our first time in Japan & our first 2 nights in Osaka. This hotel has set a high standard! The room was large. The beds (twin) extremely comfortable. I mistakenly booked a smoking room but the staff advised they had done what they could to remove the smell & they did a great job. My mistake wasn’t so bad! The bathroom was large with a nice selection of complimentary items. Breakfast was great. The staff here were wonderful & attentive. The breakfast selection had a good choice of Japanese & western cuisine. We arrived at Umeda station & missed the last shuttle bus (22.00) to the hotel so had to walk. Following the instructions sent to us from the hotel it was an easy walk in the dark with large suitcases (approx 10 mins). We had to catch the shuttle bus back to the station on our last day due to rain & it was a longer journey. Great stay & highly recommended!,"June 8, 2018","29    The Westin Osaka

1389,"I had a ton of trouble finding an affordable place to stay in Osaka with an SPG/Marriott hotel (I really wanted the Marriott Miyako Osaka but it was completely sold out). However, the Westin Osaka seemed to be a decent option near Osaka station and not too expensive.The hotel has a free shuttle from Osaka station that leaves every 20 - 30 min, and it takes approximately 15 to 20 minutes to get to the hotel (so not quick if you're in a hurry). To walk to the hotel is approximately 10-15 min as well which is difficult to do with luggage. However, the shuttle is never crowded and the personnel are friendly.The hotel is not much to look at from the outside (similar to the Westin Tokyo), but the inside is appointed very well (imagine imperialist regal?). The service was hit or miss - the bellhops were nice and efficient, but the front desk staff was slow and weren't very forthcoming with providing ""service"" to a 200+ night a year platinum guest. I had three rooms at the property, and it took 15 minutes to get the room keys (this is even after I completed online check-in and actually got to the hotel 4 hours earlier to drop off my bags and let them know I'll be back later). Also, I got to the hotel at 10AM and our rooms weren't ready (we requested early check-in) - not a problem we could hit the town and explore. However, my disable grandparents needed a place to rest and I didn't want them in the crowded and noisy lobby so I asked if they could sit in the executive lounge. It took two calls to different supervisors to let them go up and rest in the lounge (This has never been an issue in the US).The room itself was nicely appointed and comfortably sized. The view isn't half bad, and the bathroom had plenty of room (comparable to a newer Westin in most major US cities). The elevators take you to your room pretty quickly (they even have a small chair to sit on). The club lounge is nice (though dated and small) and the people are very friendly there.","May 29, 2018","29    The Westin Osaka

The Executive Lounge was wonderful, fabulous service and range of drinks and snacks. The only real problem I encountered was the WiFi, it took a long time to connect, and when it did it was very slow. Most hostels have better WiFi than this. Other than that, a wonderful stay.

1395,"We stayed for 5 nightsWe arrived on a bullet train at Shin Osaka and took a taxi for a fairly short ride to the hotel...... with luggage it is best to do this.The hotel runs a frequent (on time) shuttle to the JR Osaka station and without luggage this worked very well for us .... there is a very frequent (every 4 minutes!) train to connect the JR and Shin Osaka stations. This meant that the hotel location was excellent ... we easily went to Nara, Kyoto and HibejiWe had a room on the 14th floor ... not a spectacular view .... BUT one of the quietist rooms I had ever come across. Combine that with the bed and the buckwheat pillow and it meant a really good nights sleep!We included the breakfast buffet with our room - it was very good. We also ate a couple of evenings at the hotel and that was very good too.The front desk, concierge and restaurant staff were wonderful.

1396,"Currently staying at Westin osaka and its a nice big room for Japanese standards, good views of the city, in close proximity to Osaka station, helpful staff, free shuttle to Osaka station although it's walkable if you do not have much luggage.Bad things and I do not see this changing any time soon by looking at other reviews and their timeline this hotel still has not responded to their shortfalls which are the main one is a massive charge to use the pool approx $21 Usd per use and this is 50% discount only if you have SPG gold status. This is slightly buried on their website and I think Japan should move with times and join the rest of the world although the hotel benefits from having a pool this defeats the purpose of booking when you have to pay additional excessive prices when nowhere else in the world you encounter this. This can only be avoided if booking a club room or being an spg platinum member. Why charge for something that should be included in the room price anyway. Another disbenefit of the hotel is that television is only approximately 32"" and there are absolutely no channels in English language or any other language than Japanese. So if you want to relax at night and watch some TV if you are not fluent in Japanese I'd suggest staying somewhere else just like I will next time.And lastly only two free bottles of water per room provided as if it was champagne as well as no usb charging ports or universal power outlets in the room.

Very good way to start a day of shopping or sightseeing. Blue Bar was also very good for after dinner cocktails/drinks and cigar since in Japan you can still do that. The hotel also offers regular free shutle services about every 20mins or so to and from JR Osaka station very handy if arriving in Osaka via this station.

1416,"Karaksa Namba is located between Namba and Shinsaibashi Station - less than 10 mins walk to either. This makes it very easy to use trains to see things within Osaka or to use it as a base to do day trips to places like Nara or Uji. The shops and bright lights of Dotonbori eg Glico Man are just 5 mins walk away - and in a different direction you are just as close to the Americamura area. The hotel is surrounded by many places to eat, convenience stores, etc. The hotel is very new and the rooms are cleverly designed. The 5 of us had connecting rooms with 3 beds in one and 2 beds in the other. It was big enough for the 5 of us with a large suitcase each. Great to have 2 bathrooms with 2 separate toilets. Whilst the rooms do not have wardrobes there are some hooks for hanging clothes and we found these sufficient. A sign in the lift advised that you could ask for clothes racks. The rooms are extremely clean as were common areas of the hotel. The staff were friendly but may need a little more training to give English speaking guests clearer detail on directions, buying tickets for Universal Studios etc. Breakfast was free and was ok. The cold items (broccoli, tomatoes, corn, lettuce, yoghurt, tinned mango, frozen berries, etc) were all good. Each day there were 3 hot dishes and they varied in terms of whether we liked them. However the hotel is catering to a mix of nationalities so we understood that others may have liked what we didn't! There was also croissants, bread rolls, cereal, and a mix of drinks via dispensing machines. In the afternoon/evening the breakfast area was set up with drinks and a couple of packaged snacks (biscuit, chocolate, etc) available also for no charge. The breakfast area is busy at breakfast and it is cafeteria type style but we always got a seat and were always able to leave full enough to sightsee. Would stay here again as room design was great and location makes it very easy to get from airport (use train to namba station and then use exit 24/25 and walk up Midsojuji towards hotel ).","January 13, 2019","30    karaksa hotel Osaka Namba

1425,"Our week long stay at the Karaksa Hotel turned out to be quite enjoyable, after an initial room change due to a odorous a/c unit in the first room. For the most part, the hotel is very well maintained and the staff work hard to keep it very clean. The hotel is a newer building with a nicely decorated modern theme. It’s located very conveniently near the Dotonbori and Shinsaibashi shopping and restaurant areas and about a 20 minute walk (800m) to the central Namba train station. The area immediately around the hotel is quiet being away from the main bustle. Front desk and housekeeping staff were courteous and helpful.Our room was generally very quiet with a capable a/c unit. It’s small like most Asian hotel rooms, but its modern design is very thoughtfully done. There’s a separate toilet room for use when someone else is in the shower. It also has a small built toilet paper shelf for (ahem) your cellphone. There are lots of USB ports and electrical outlets built into the headboard by the beds. Smart, useful.The shower only unit is quite big with modern and practical to use fixtures and lots of hot water. Our housekeeping and room cleanliness was excellent as is the standard set with most Japanese hotels of any class.The beds were firm but comfortable with nice clean bedding and linens.There is also an excellent door to door airport shuttle at a nominal charge that we took from the hotel to Kansai airport.Our stay included a hot and cold buffet breakfast which was only fair to my palate. It caters more to Asian tastes. Unfortunately, most items are reheated prepared foods. There’s also some bread, buns and cereal. The strong coffee was very good. A nice feature is the breakfast eating area is available to make late evening snacks like instant noodles.Overall, we enjoyed our stay at the Karaksa Hotel.","October 23, 2018","30    karaksa hotel Osaka Namba

1427,"My family of 2 adults and 2 children (6 and 9 years) stayed for 3 nights at this hotel. We had adjoining rooms, which was great as it gave us more space than a quad room. The hotel has a minimalist and contemporary design, which we liked. The rooms were light coloured and comfortable. The shower is a walk in one with a separate washbasin area. The toilet was separate to the shower/wash basin. The rooms comes with a very small fridge (fine for drinks), hot water and green tea. You can choose to have an ""Eco"" room service, which means they replace the towels and empty the bins but they don't make the beds. However, they then provide you with 2 free bottles of water instead.Check in was fine. The reception desk has lots of staff and most seem to be bilingual. Therefore, we never had any problems finding someone at the reception desk who could speak English.The breakfast is simple and adequate. Most of the food seems to come from a packet or a can but there are some cereals, toast, 3 hot foods and salad, amongst other things.The hotel also offers a free welcome drink in the afternoon and evening, which means you're welcome to help yourself to the hot or cold drinks from the drink machine (eg coffee, tea, soft drinks). Still it was a nice touch. There was also a box of board games that people could use.The hotel is a in a ""laneway"" off the main road. The area seemed quiet though. There were complimentary toiletries in the reception foyer.Other useful info:- there is a small Family Mart a few metres away;- the hotel offers a shuttle to KIX but you need to book in advance and I think it costs 1000 yen per person;- Namba Station is a 5 to 10 minute walk away and it can be done with suitcases in tow (you'll need to take exit 24 if you need an elevator);- Dotomburi is within walking distance.Overall, we enjoyed staying at the hotel and would recommend it.","October 3, 2018","30    karaksa hotel Osaka Namba

1428,"We stayed here 3 nights and we had connecting rooms. Compared to other hotels in Japan the rooms were spacious. The rooms were spotless & everything worked as it should. The front desk staff spoke English fairly well and had many maps and brochures to point us to the subway easily. The location is very walkable to restaurants, shops and subway. We never made it to breakfast so I can't comment on that. We would stay here again, especially with kids. It made it nice to be able to slide the door closed and have some privacy and space. My only complaint was that we had more than one taxi driver really struggle to find it (despite showing them the name in Japanese). Be sure to ask the front desk for a card to show any drivers to make sure you can find it again.","September 18, 2018","30    karaksa hotel Osaka Namba

1429,"Great location, awesome staff, clean as an operating room, ok value for money. The Namba location of this new formula hotel is right in the middle of everything. The staff were incredible to the point of overdoing it. But you need to know that this style of hotel may not check all the boxes if you are a westerner used to rooms and amenities found in places like a Westin or other established chains. I think Karaksa is definitely appealing to a young Asian based traveler that has a certain taste for super clean ultra minimal room designs and amenities. I paid $170/night at this location. I am going to say that Red Planet (another newish formula hotel found in Japan, Thailand and Indonesia) gave me a better experience for @$100 dollars less per night. Yes that was in Nagoya,so you will pay a premium for the Osaka location, however I think that RP is still a class leading value property that is hard to beat.. At Karaksa there is no desk in the room, just two tiny stools and tiny table. That’s it. Very hard to work in the room. I feel like they want you to go to the public spaces of the hotel. No coffee cups in the room , just two small tea cups. So no In room coffee. You like to get up, check your mail with a hot cup of coffee ? You have to go down to the lobby to get it. Another glaring issue at the Karaksa would be breakfast . I was shocked that they used so many single use items. Paper cups, paper bowls, paper plates. Not only did the whole experience feel like I was eating breakfast in a third grade classroom, it is also unbelievably irresponsible in this day in age and a clear sign that they don’t want to hire a dishwasher and instead generate massive amounts of garbage. Just lazy in my book. And please don’t talk about recycling solving that tactic. Most likely I will not return to this chain. However I think they will be a success with millennials for sure and with budget travelers that appreciate a very Japanese approach. Airport shuttle a great deal and super convenient if you have luggage’s. ","September 15, 2018","30    karaksa hotel Osaka Namba

Namba Station was also a short walk away.There were restaurants and small eating stores surrounding the hotel.We shall come back to stay at the hotel.","January 26, 2018","30    karaksa hotel Osaka Namba

1444,"Stayed at this hotel for 3 nights. The location was great. There are heaps of restaurants nearby and it is very close to the Shinsaibashi shopping street. Also a short walk to Dotonbori. The hotel is brand new, so it was very clean and up to date. USB sockets for charging, a great shower with a handheld shower head and a 'rain' style shower on the room. The toilet and shower are separate, with a sink in each. There was no soap in the toilet sink, which was a little odd. I didn't have breakfast here, but a friend said it was quite average. I really enjoyed my stay here.","January 7, 2018","30    karaksa hotel Osaka Namba

1445,"I have stayed 3 nights from 05-08Nov, where the hotel should be newly opened on 01Nov. Room is clean with twin beds which is comfortable, but the pillow (2 types) are both too soft and no other choices as already asked the reception. Therefore, cannot have a good sleep for 3 nights. Shower room only which is quite big, with separate toilet, and this is convenient, but water pressure is fine just not strong enough. Breakfast is free but only very limited choices with sausages, bread, few vegetables for salad, noodles/spaghetti, and no Japanese food at all. Drinks are free till 9pm, good. One more thing is that although the room size is okay in Japanese standard, but the table inside the room is small with a TV, and also a very small size bar table and bar chairs. Therefore, everything bought had to put on the floor, and suggest the hotel should consider to replace the bar table and chairs with a sofa.","November 22, 2017","30    karaksa hotel Osaka Namba

The staff has both Japanese and English speakers on site which was convenient since they made reservations for us at a restaurant. The room sizes were average, but bigger than our stay in Tokyo. We really enjoyed the free coffee and tea in the lobby that we used before departing for the day and upon return. The location was good as well.

Everything about the hotel felt clean and new. Our room was a little small, but the bathroom was amazing, in particular the large, modern shower. The breakfast was great as well as the service.

There a huge promenade of stores in a covered walkway about 2 blocks from the hotel that leads to the Dotombori area. It is about half a mile covered with every store you can imagine.

1457,"Spent a few days at The Flag. Very enjoyable stay. Hotel has a calm, quiet yet friendly atmosphere assisted by decor, furnishings and, importantly, welcoming staff. Room on 6th floor ...not a particularly nice outlook but room, though fairly compact, spotless and efficient. Enjoyed good sleeps each night. Air con and safe worked well. Had breakfast once...nice room, fairly popular, good choice western and local foods. The hotel opens on to a very busy neighbourhood, vast shopping arcades and close to underground mall and ground level prestige stores as well myriad small and ""unusual"" shops. Numerous eateries closeby and nearest metro line about 8 mins walk. We flew out back to UK from Kansai airport. Hotel kindly arranged a taxi, pre arranged flat rate. Very convenient, efficient service. This part of Osaka is very busy but good fun and felt safe. Shin Osaka - for bullet trains... a reasonably short journey on the underground. This allowed us to enjoy a number of day trips from Osaka such as Hiroshima, Himeji castle and Okayama kraken garden. We thought the hotel worked well on all levels.

1458,"Arrived about 30-40 min early but was able to check in. It is literally a few minutes walk from the subway. But I will say that google maps has a hard time navigating in this region, so look at the map to know where to go.Check in was smooth. The room is nice but small. But managed nicely with ledges for items above the bed (no nightstands). The bathroom has a decent size step up, which is odd. The shower is large, no tub. Water pressure is good; shower is fairly large. Toilet is great; toilet paper is on the cheap side. The bed is quite firm and comfortable for my taste. There is no closet or any system for hanging items...so know that hanging wet clothes is a challenge. The AC works great and is in both English and Japanese. The blackout shades are not absolute. This wouldn’t necessarily be a big deal except that the sun rises in the 4 o’clock hour...so the room lightens up early.WiFi was surprisingly not awesome. I ended up using my pocket WiFi (Japan wireless - highly recommend), which was much better. They do provide a Handy, which is great in the event you do not have any other option for WiFi outside of the hotel.There is noise around that you can hear - both inside and out. I wouldn’t let it deter you but I always sleep with a white noise app. There is only one outlet close to the bed (more within the room but nothing close to the bed). I have a multi plug adapter, which worked great but if you have a bunch of things and do not have this, your items will not be in arms reach. No direct USB ports, which I found strange for this type of hotel.There is laundry on the 2nd floor, which was hugely convenient (¥300 wash; ¥100/30 min dry). But I will tell you that I had very few items to dry (most of which were wicking types of fabric) and it still took 3 drying sessions. I did not opt for breakfast but I did opt for the tea ceremony, which was lovely. I don’t like matcha tea and didn’t particularly care for the sweet that was given, but learning the way of tea here in Japan was kind of cool. The women who taught us were very nice as well. Would recommend.Overall a nice hotel with a central location to shopping and nightlife. Would recommend.","June 10, 2019","31    HOTEL THE FLAG Shinsaibashi

1459,This recently built hotel looks lovely and is excellent value. The rooms are smallish but functional and the shower was excellent. The only negative is a lack of storage. Bigger wardrobe space and some hooks around the room would help. There are some nice touches like free coffee all day which you can drink in the spacious but cosy reception area and the staff are friendly and helpful. Shinsaibashi is lively and buzzing and it is an easy walk from the hotel to Dotonbori canal and the amazing food stalls.The lovely lanes around the hotel are filled with restaurants and bars.

1461,"Room was small, but actually not too bad by Japan standards. Location-wise, it is a short walk to the Shinsabashi shopping street, but at the very end of the street, so it is a long walk to the Dotonbori area. What stands out about this hotel is the sophisticated and hearty breakfast buffet; not run-off-the-mill standard items, but unique dishes (if you come in early, before 8am, you will catch the steak slices; delicious and very tender! Unfortunately, they do not replenish). The complimentary 24-hour coffee machine in the lobby included cappuccino and latte; a nice feature and perk! Very friendly and efficient staff; helpful and accommodating. They gave us sound advice as we worried about getting back to the airport: simply take a short cab ride to Namba OCAT bus station, and take the Airport Limousine Bus! Hassle-free, and no worrying about catching the train or subway with heavy luggages.I would look at other hotels closer to Dotonburi, but if you prefer the Shinsaibashi shopping street, this is a good base.","June 5, 2019","31    HOTEL THE FLAG Shinsaibashi

On several occasions, they were very helpful from checking in to directing to the nearest clinic to directions to a place. They have English speaking employees. The petite Japanese lady spoke very fluently. The hotel is a short walk from the Shinsaibashi station. Less than 5 minutes and central to the shopping district. A short 15 slow walk to Dontonbori area and Namba station. The area is lively with tons of tourist, especially Chinese. The area is a Very different experience than Shinjuku or Shibuya area. The standard rooms are small and to be expected of Japan. The designs are nice. The negative I have about the room is the TV location. It's to the side of the bed, making it difficult to watch. Each day comes with two bottles of water. Free wifi. The room has a safety box and other basic amenities. Love the shower area! The robes are comfy and get replaced daily. The balcony window does not open. The common area is interesting. I'm not very sure about the seats by the library area though. The one by the central fireplace is comfortable. There is an on the site laundry room. No public bath or gym on site. The luggage storage is an odd placement. It's in the middle of the library area.

This is probably done because the street view would be terrible. Great, there is free coffee and tea but almost any hotel in the world has that by now. Honestly disappointed by the hype on TA.

Delightful breakfast buffet with lots of veggies and a good assortment of food. My only comment is please increase the amount of fruits, nuts and gluten free grains.

1477,This hotel is good value for money for the newly refurbished interiors of the room ans it is located very close to the subway station. Even the room we stayed at is a bit too small it's like that in Japan,"April 19, 2019","31    HOTEL THE FLAG Shinsaibashi

1478,"It's very well located for Osaka's hotspots. Bars are restaurants all over the place!The room was comfortable, but the windows are frosted and only open an inch or so, so it can fell claustrophobic. There isn't much of a view, which is probably why they frosted the glass. They offer free tea and coffee in the lounge and there's a coin-operated laundromat in the hotel. The lounge itself is very nice and a decent place to chill before stepping out into the bustle. ","April 18, 2019","31    HOTEL THE FLAG Shinsaibashi

1479,"Stayed here as a base for 6nights in Osaka. Really pleased with our choice as a family of 3 wanting comfort and a good location.We decided upon a deluxe twin and were delighted with the size of our room, comfort of beds and luxury of the bathroom and associated amenities.Breakfast always provided a good start to the day for us preferring the western choices and our 10 year old feasting on chicken nuggets and cake!For 3 nights we ate excellent Japanese food at Nakago just opposite (and to the right as you leave) the hotel. For us it was great not to have to walk far for dinner after long days exploring the region. We think it should be on the hotels recommendations list!Would highly recommend The Flag to anyone.","April 16, 2019","31    HOTEL THE FLAG Shinsaibashi

Location wise we quickly realised how handy it was, if you're looking to go to the main area for dinner or drinks, this hotel is very close and easily walkable.

1481,"This hotel is just mediocre. I wished that we would have stayed at a different hotel but I already had this pre booked. The bathroom had a step down that was dangerous. The room temperature was hot but if you turned on the AC, it was a dinky machine that blew air onto one person in the bed. The trash can was the size of a pencil box.","April 14, 2019","31    HOTEL THE FLAG Shinsaibashi

1482,Located on a small street this hotel is near to all the attractions in Osaka. Metro is close by and a great selection of restaurants and shops in walking distance. Check in was a breeze. Very comfortable room with a great bed. The shower is wonderful. Great selection of Western and Japanese food for breakfast. Very good coffee free all day long in lounge. The staff are multi lingual and always ready to help with a smile. Will definitely go back to The Flag next time we are in Osaka.,"April 8, 2019","31    HOTEL THE FLAG Shinsaibashi

1483,"This hotel caught me by suprise, it's located in a small street (I walked passed it) and when I found it I wasnt sure what I was getting. However I must say I was pleasently suprised. The hotel is clean and tidy and in a great location. 10 min Walking distance of the Dōtonbori and other attractions and 15 min walk to Osaka Gymnasium if you are heading to the Sumo's. The rooms were good the only issue I had was the leg space between the toilet and wall was minimal (im 6 foot) and my knees were jamed into the wall. The rooms have a reverse cycle heating and cooling device on the wall which I'm not a fan of. For the price and location I can see why this is rated so highly-would stay again when next in Osaka","April 6, 2019","31    HOTEL THE FLAG Shinsaibashi

1484,"We just stayed here in a standard room. We found it to be spacious enough for us with 3 pieces of luggage to sustain a 9 night stay. The bathroom is roomy and has an awesome rain shower. Rooms were especially clean. The hotel staff were all very helpful. Everyone we interacted with spoke English well enough. The hotel is near Shinsaibashi station which is helpful. It is also within walking distance of a lot of shopping, restaurants and Dotonobori. We would definitely stay there again. We took the Airport Limousine Bus from Kansai Intl. Airport to Hotel Nikko Osaka which is just about a 5-7 minute walk away to Hotel The Flag. It beats taking a train and hauling your luggage on the trains. Check the bus times though. They are limited to this stop at Hotel Nikko Osaka.","March 29, 2019","31    HOTEL THE FLAG Shinsaibashi

1485,"Our first hotel on arrival into Japan and were very impressed. Relatively small hotel, the staff were very friendly and helpful. Arriving mid morning, as expected our room was not ready, but cases were safely stowed and free tea/coffee and water was available from the excellent machine in the communal area. Umbrellas were also readily available on loan in the reception area, as it was raining.We stayed in a Deluxe double room and it was good. Not huge, but light and well laid out it had everything we needed. The furniture as shown in the photograph was simple but effective, with electronic safe in a drawer. Also provided were kettle, tea bags and bottled water each day. The bathroom had an excellent shower and deep(though not long) tub, with lovely toiletries provided and replenished daily, together with Dyson hairdryer! The hotel also provide a. ‘Handy’ phone which allows free calls within Japan, messaging and internet access whilst out and about - we found this very useful.Breakfast was very good, with a good selection of foods, both Japanese and western style; sugar cereals, small fresh rolls and fruit was available, rice porridge, rice & soups, bacon, scrambled eggs, chicken nuggets, salads, yoghurt, cake and jams. Various juices, detox water and coffee/hot water/hot milk machinesThe communal area, with books and large screen tv was minimalist style with a variety of chairs and off this area was the smoking room and laundry. Washers and Driers, were available for a nominal charge (cash coins) and free sachets of detergent were provided. There is also a 24hr tea/coffee machine (different language options), offering a variety of good quality drinks.The hotel was well located just a few minutes walk from Dotonbori and local restaurants offered great traditional foods.We would recommend and also would stay here again.","March 26, 2019","31    HOTEL THE FLAG Shinsaibashi

1486,Highly recommend. Very near dotonbori which is a must see while in the area. You get to borrow a ‘handy’ phone for your stay which allows you to use 4g when you are out and about. Very friendly staff with excellent English.Immaculately clean. Shiseido amenities. Great shower. Surprisingly quiet given its location. View from the room is just onto a relatively quiet street. Breakfast was great with a massive selection to suit all tastes (rather randomly you can have chicken nuggets)! Railway station is just 5 mins away. Loads of nearby eateries and an amazing shopping mall 2 mins away. I would return here. ,"March 25, 2019","31    HOTEL THE FLAG Shinsaibashi

Terrific area of Osaka within walking distance of the Shinsaibashi shopping area. Close to nearby subways stations. Breakfast was great but could have done with a toaster and a bit more fruit.

1490,"Outstanding city centre hotel. We stayed for 3 nights and were so impressed that we booked another night for our return to Osaka a week later. The location is incredible, 5 mins to the station, it’s ideal even with luggage as the roads are so flat. You are less than 5 mins to the centre and all the food and shops. Within in a few steps are bars and restaurants and a couple of family marts/ 7 elevens. The rooms are a great size for city centre Japan. The bathrooms are modern and the showers are very good. Free coffee 24/7 is an added bonus. Finally the staff are so helpful. They have maps, flow charts printed to help you get to the airport on public transport and they speak multiple languages. This is a great hotel, you won’t be disappointed. ","March 2, 2019","31    HOTEL THE FLAG Shinsaibashi

1496,"My wife and I spent 6 nights in this hotel in late October. This was my third visit to Osaka, and I decided to be rather picky about the location of my lodging. I wanted to be in Shinsaibashi, the intersection of the Midosuji Line and the Nagahori Tsurumi-ryokuchi Line of the subway. Reasons: we would arrive in Osaka, and would also take day trips, using the Shin-Osaka station on the Midosuji Line, and, I would go to the Tamatsukuri station on the Nagahori Tsurumi-ryokuchi Line for three work days. Looking at hotels around Shinsaibashi, I picked Hotel the Flag based on all the positive reviews on this site. My own experience was very good indeed. We reserved a room for two at a very attractive rate ahead of time. Arriving from Tokyo on a Friday afternoon, we realized the size of this room would be very restricting for two of us with luggage for two weeks. After a very quick chat with the hotel front desk, we were able to switch to possibly their largest guest room. Two full beds, sizeable bathroom with modern amenities, a nice desk / work area, and plenty of shelf and clothes-hanging space. We ended up paying more for this larger room. Yet, the comfort level, and how efficiently the switch got handled, made it all very reasonable. The hotel had modern designs and was small enough to be cozy. The multi-lingual staff left me a very nice impression. We enjoyed the buffet breakfast every day. The many practical touches in the hotel included the coin-op laundry facility and a multi-purpose library area. The guest rooms had windows that were very good with respect to sound-proofing. Returning to my hotel room at night really meant getting a relief from the huge noisy crowd, the party scene and overwhelming sounds of Shinsaibashi. Upon departure, we took advantage of the KIX airport limousine pick-up just two blocks away (at the Hotel Nikko), adding to the good feeling of our stay.","January 26, 2019","31    HOTEL THE FLAG Shinsaibashi

1498,"If you’re looking for a hotel that offers a room that is clean and comfortable without compromising on convenience, look no further. Location - it’s very conveniently located near the subway exit, and along the road to the hotel you will find family mart, drugstores along the shinsaibashi suji as well as the famed ichiran all within 2-3 walk. Room size was ok considering that it is Japan but as a solo traveller, there is nothing to fault on the room size (twin room). The cleanliness and the amenities provided were of good quality. The bed and pillows were comfortable and housekeeping was always very well done. Overall there is nothing to fault about the hotel and if i were to visit Osaka again, this will be my first choice as it is one of the best hotels i have stayed in recently.
