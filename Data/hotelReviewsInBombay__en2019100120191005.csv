1,"This is definitly the best B&B that me and my family have been. The house is so beautiful, with enough space to feel like you're alone there. Comfortable beds, nice views, every thing clean and spotless. And for a unique touch, delicious home made biscuits, bread and granola. The owners are super frendly and ready to help with anything. % recommend it!","October 7, 2018","0    Heaven's Rest B&B

3,"Needed to stay over in the area, but local hotel,motels were either booked or bloody expensive.Never booked a B&B before, Robert and Co at Heavens Rest are amazing, their home is absolutely gorgeous and as close to Heaven as it could be.Rest, well we did eventually, had to step outside late of an evening and just check out the night sky.An amazing experience that other forms of accomodation are going to have to be exceptional to beat.Thank you Robert for a wonderful stay and all of the little and not so little things you were so professional about doing for us.Though Auckland is our domicile city, we'll be back, I promise.","September 8, 2018","0    Heaven's Rest B&B

4,"Sharon and Peter were so wonderful and accomodating. They went the extra mile to make sure my parter and I felt welcome and were looked after during our visit. We were there for a wedding at Bracu. This meant we were a bit dusty in the morning but the included breakfast really helped. They were also very accommodating for my Gluten Free needs and had GF sausages and toast and jams etc. The room was simple, but had everything needed, and there was access to an iron and hairdryer. It really was like visiting a favorite Aunty and Uncle for the weekend. I would absolutely recommend Petshari to any of my friends. ","October 6, 2017","2    Petshari Lodge

5,"These people are Kiwi gems. We had a wedding at Bracu. Sharon ferried us there and back even though she had her own visitors. After the wedding on arriving back to the B and B Pete and Sharon gave us a Baileys night cap. We shared some laughs and solved the problems of the world. The breakfast was delicious, hospitality A1 and nothing was too much trouble. A definite MUST stay for all. Thank you Pete and Sharon you guys are the epitome of kiwi hospitality.","June 12, 2016","2    Petshari Lodge

6,"We stayed two nights with Sharon and Peter last week. We are a family - two adults and three children (8 yo, 3 yo and 2 yo). Sharon was amazing. Totally put us at ease, and made us feel so welcome. It's nerve wracking staying in someone's home with a two and three year old LOUD boys, but Sharon took them in her stride. She had toys for them, and chatted away to them. Our three year old LOVED her! The cooked breakfast every morning was delicious. I had mentioned in an email prior to arrival that we needed wheat free sausages for breakfast, so Sharon also bought gluten free bread. It's the little things like that, that make you feel special. Thanks Sharon. We know where to stay next time we're in Bombay!","January 19, 2016","2    Petshari Lodge

7,While We were traveling from Rotorua to Auckland need to stay only one night before night my overseas friends fly out we found this one of the most beautiful place and wonderful kiwi host. Thank you so much for your excellent hospitality and kindness. My Korean friends all said that they felt this place is the most welcome and warm feeling of among all there 10 days trip on New Zealand. I love all your lovely Royal Albert collection and cute teddy bear each room. Also very convenient each room has unsuited bathroom. I had a great B&B experience at your place too living in New Zealand last 15 years. We'll visit you again sometime in the future. Thank you once again and take care!!,"January 18, 2016","2    Petshari Lodge

8,We had been travelling for most of the day having set off from the Coromandel Peninsula with the aim of spending our last night in Auckland. We hadn't realised Mick Jagger was in town and Auckland was booked up. We drove South stopping at every motel we found and it was the same story. Eventually we were given the details for Petshari Lodge and they had a room. It wasn't how we had expected to spend our last night of our holiday but the greeting we received from hosts Peter and Sharon as well as the tea and cakes made up for it. We nipped out for tea and awoke to a lovely full breakfast before heading to the airport. Thanks again Peter & Sharon.,"February 1, 2015","2    Petshari Lodge

10,"We stayed at Petshari Lodge when we were in Pukekohe for the V8 supercar meeting as competitors. Pete and Sharon always asked how our day went when we returned over a cold beer. They made us feel extremely welcome and we are looking forward to staying with them again, the breakfast was huge and much more than anyone would expect. They make you feel like you're staying with long lost friends!","May 6, 2014","2    Petshari Lodge

11,"My wife, son and myself had the goodluck of a close friend recommending we stay at PETSHARI LODGE recently .We had a family event to attend close to the lodge and wanted a nice place to stay that night. After returning from this event we were greeted by Sharon and Peter they where so welcoming it felt like we staying with friends. We had a wonderful next few hours talking and retired to our well set out bedroom it was true quality all round. In the morning we were greeted with an awesome cooked breakfast and conversation plus wonderful outlook from the kitchen table looking out over the hills and countryside.Thank you both so much we cant wait to stay again maybe next time on our Harley Davison seen you have garaging to park it for us..","April 27, 2014","2    Petshari Lodge

12,"After a long drive from Tauranga en route to Auckland, we stopped at the i near Pukekohe on Route 1 30 minutes south of Auckland and were persuaded to overnight in the Petshari Lodge, a B & B run by Peter and Sharon. Their house sits on a hill overlooking miles of countryside. Met at the door by Sharon, welcomed very warmly to their beautiful home and served coffee, tea and biscuits, we shared relaxed chatter with Sharon and her husband Peter. They suggested Maggie’s for dinner (highly recommended) and, on arrival, Maggie told us that Sharon had telephone down to her and ‘treated’ us to our first drink! Returning after dinner to the B & B, Sharon again invited us to have a night cap with them. The next morning she served a superb full breakfast. For any traveller approaching Auckland and wishing to avoid the hassle of the City or just wanting a break from any pressure, we strongly recommend Petshari Lodge.","March 23, 2014","2    Petshari Lodge

13,"Well it’s an Interesting one. It’s difficult to really experience true New Zealand hospitality from a Hotel or even a Motel. We stayed here as a Family, two kids included and really enjoyed ourselves. This is a great spot only 30 minutes from downtown Auckland! If you enjoy a quiet place with excellent KIWI hosts then this may well be what you are looking for. A real country feel so close to the city, space, peace and quiet great hosts. Thanks to Sharon & Peter, oh and ‘Choca’ the dog….. I’ll be back…….","November 19, 2013","2    Petshari Lodge
