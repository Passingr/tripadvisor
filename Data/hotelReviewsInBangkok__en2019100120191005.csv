1,I read online that the service this place offers is great and I can 100% confirm that. I enjoyed my stay. They have a cool pool. Amazing breakfast. I’ll come back for sure when I’m in Bangkok at the end of the year.Moni from the staff was super helpful and very valuable for the duration of my stay.TIP: never get an Airbnb or stay at a hostel in Bangkok. My friends and I made that mistake. The pictures are all fake and you’re better off going to a respectable hotel like Akara.,"July 12, 2019","0    Akara Hotel

Then we were guided to our upgraded Suite Room with a short room introduction. The bed is very comfortable, one of the best I've had in hotels. The suite is very nice with high tech switch control and smart TV. The location is great with free TukTuk service to nearest BTS. Excellent services from all the staff here especially Chomp! He is super friendly and always with big smiles. The complimentary high tea was great with nice ambience.

Hotel also provides you free shuttle bus to BTS station during the day. But I didn’t even want to go out because my wife and I had too much fun in the hotel.

Getting from the BKK airport is very simple because the sky rail runs from airport to just a block away, and we were promptly greeted with a complimentary happy hour and appetizers (every day 2-5). The food was delicious and we felt VERY welcomed. I cannot thank the staff enough (Mr. Marc, Ms. Nit, Mr. Dear, Mr. Boonclin, Mr. Roj) the entire team went above and beyond.

49,"I found this hotel online and thought it might be a good place to stay since I really didn’t know much about the geography of Thailand. Unfortunately, the location leave something to be desired. It’s not very accessible to a lot of the things you would want to see in Thailand. There are so many better areas that I later found out that I wish I would’ve stayed at. Also the concierge was very unhelpful when I was trying to Decide on where to go for my first day of sightseeing. He sent me off with a driver but they really took me for a ride. I lost pretty much the whole day and later found out that the concierge gets a kickback from the drivers. Overall I would not recommend this place. There are so many better hotels. I wish I would have researched a little harder when looking for a hotel. I think it would’ve made my stay in Thailand much better.","May 28, 2019","0    Akara Hotel

54,"5Star *****Stayed there for 2 nights with friends .. before heading to Krabi, Thailand! Staff are very friendly and helpful .. take the breakfast option if you can (they have vegetarian option too... I was very happy!) .. they have different hot food everyday (set-menu) and they cook right there and then for u ... at first I though that the hotel location is a bit far away from the Center .. I was wrong ! Metro is within walking distance .. Iconsiam mall is also within walking distance - shopping paradise for people who love shopping ! You can also take ferry from there to all the major historic places ! Get the hotel staff recommendations for the best places to eat and see while you are in Bangkok! Fai is the owner and she is there most of the time interacting with the guests during the breakfast time and making sure your stay is pleasant! You fell like you are in a 5 star hotel with all the attention the staff gives you during your stay ..... even though it’s just a small lovely B&B! Also Fai designed the whole property and it’s beautiful arranged .. from guest rooms to public areas (check-out) the picture on their page ....I highly recommend Vera Nidhra B&B ... for anyone that wants to stay in a beautiful B&B/ hotel while visiting Bangkok. I am going there back for sure !","July 4, 2019","1    Vera Nidhra

During our stay, we had no problem nor did we encounter any issues despite a couple of late night return to the residence. It was a fairly safe neighbourhood with good local eateries within 15 minutes walk. We especially enjoyed the soya milk and fritters that was close by to the residence that we patronised the stall thrice within our short few days stay in Bangkok!Guests could choose the option of local or western breakfast at Vera Nidhra. Would strongly recommend the local option that would allow one to learn more of the local food culture. Faby was most thoughtful in taking the initiative to switch out from our local breakfast to western breakfast on the last day of our stay as Hainanese Chicken rice was served for the local option, and that is commonly available back in the country where I came from.

The engineers and maintenance staff are amazing and respond quickly to fix a issue or ensure that the room is suitable to your liking. I never heard of Dream before and accidentally stumbled on the hotel. I’m glad I did and find this place to be very comfortable. The cost/efficiency ratio at this place is amazing. Meaning that although the hotel is inexpensive, it is still super nice and clean and the entire staff all the way to security guard actually seem like they want to be there and enjoy what they are doing. Very happy atmosphere. And as a side note , the little blue thematic ambience is really nice and adds a cool little touch. In addition, they even have a little gym as well so one can burn some beer calories off, as I did in the gym. Impressive place especially for the price. ","July 2, 2019","2    Dream Bangkok

113,"As a former resident of Bangkok I visit this city every year to visit old friends and ""get lost"" for two weeks. This is my first stay at these premises and I had a very pleasant and stress free time. Everything was very clean and the room was large enough for me. The staff was helpful and friendly especially the male employees. They were a very energetic and enthusiastic group.Although the complimentary tuk tuk shuttle to the skytrain and metro stations was not available in the first week it made up for it in my second week. It saved me some time as it takes about 10 to 15 minutes if I walked there. A 20 baht tip was much appreciated.The breakfast staff was efficient and friendly. Eastern and western fare was served and sometimes a tiny glass of energy drink made from fruit and vegetable was also offered. My slight disappointment was that there was no dim sum in the eastern section. The past establishments I stayed in had a small dim sum section. This will be very popular with the guests.My stay was in the annex building which houses the swimming pool and gym. They have efficient traffic guards with red flags to guide you across the small road. The men work from dawn to dusk and I hope the management may consider providing them with carbon masks to protect them from exhaust fumes as traffic can be very busy at times.I was happy and satisfied with my short sojourn and I will stay there again if I am fortunate enough to visit the city next year.","June 14, 2019","2    Dream Bangkok

The pool.is open till 10pm and for the first time in a long time I was able to walk straight into a pool at evening time after a long day in the heat and just enjoy the coolness of the water. Not cold, not take 5 mins to get used to the cold and then have to keep swimming to keep warm. Just walk in and it was like a cool ideal temperature bath. I just stood there or floated or sat down next to part with the jets. It was perfect. I stayed there until 9pm. I just dont know why other hotels dont do this. They have rooftop pools in a hot climate that are freezing and you have to actually swim to try and keep.warm. I'm on holiday, not training to keep fit. If this cheaper hotel can do it, why cant luxurious expensive hotels like marina bay, face suites In KL do it and they have views to die for that make you want to just stop and stand in the pool and watch but you are too cold to stop and stand.

Could not get AC temperature to adjust - was either completely off or freezing!Breakfast buffet and Flava restaurant, however, were excellent. Large selection on buffet, with fresh juice, coffee machine and made-to-order omelets. Different health drink offerings each day were fun to sample. Extensive dinner menu - Thai, Italian, American- and reasonably priced for hotel food. Recommend the coconut ice cream in coconut shell!Crossing the street between the two hotel buildings is treacherous!

It is a modern, neat, clean hotel that is situated in the perfect location. You are only minutes away from both the subway and the SkyTrain, and literally a block away from one of the most bustling streets in Bangkok, with restaurants, bars, and shopping galore.We chose a basic room, as is our practice whenever we travel. Nevertheless, it was roomy, clean, in good repair, and had very nice amenities. The Flava Restaurant on the second floor is outstanding, and offers a breakfast buffet that has been selected as one of the top breakfasts in Bangkok. We also availed ourselves of the Coran Spa on the third floor. WOW! What a wonderful Thai massage.What must be emphasized most about Dream Hotel is the staff. They make the stay most memorable. If you need a taxi or a tuk-tuk, it will be there in a minute or two...if you need advice on travel mode or restaurant, it is graciously forthcoming. Whatever assistance you need, they provide efficiently and with a genuine smile. Our favorite memory from our stay is one of the staff at the Flava restaurant. Her name was Nuch, and she is the most delightful person that you could meet. She assisted us in many of our meals, and always exhibited a genuine and beaming personality and smile. When we think of Bangkok and the Dream Hotel, Nuch will always be in or memories.We would return to Dream without hesitation. It is a great place to stay!","June 7, 2019","2    Dream Bangkok

The breakfast was excellent with a multitude of choice.After lots of walking and sightseeing in Bangkok we tried but failed miserably to find free sun-beds later in the afternoon so did not get a chance to use the pool although we did have a couple of drinks in the small area near the bar.Would recommend this hotel to friends and family.,"May 5, 2019","2    Dream Bangkok

146,"What a great stay. Large and comfortable room, the staff are extremely friendly and helpful and the breakfast buffet is just incredible. Dream Bangkok is in a great location, plenty of bars and restaurants close by and a short walk to Asok BTS station or Sukhumvit MRT station making it easy to get anywhere else you need to go.The swimming pool and bar area is perfect for a late afternoon chill out session, although the hotel is split into two buildings so you may have to cross between buildings to get there. The road to cross is only a little back road but it's Bangkok so it does get busy- the warden will stop the traffic for you as soon as you get there so no waiting/risking your life is involved.The breakfast buffet is amazing, it is worth the stay just for this if nothing else. We stayed in a different hotel for the last two nights of our trip which we paid almost as much as we paid for 5 nights at Dream and their breakfast didn't even come close to Dream's.Location is excellent, easy to get to BTS and MRT station and to and from the airport link (Makkasan station is closest). We paid 30 THB to get from the airport to Makkasan and a taxi from Makkasan to the hotel is about 100 THB, a lot cheaper than taxi from the airport all the way to the hotel.I highly recommend this hotel for a great value stay in Bangkok.","April 30, 2019","2    Dream Bangkok

170,"All the positive reviews (4 star and 5 star) are from those people who have stayed at this hotel as part of a group tour arranged by a tour company. Yes, if you are coming here to stay as part of an organized group, this hotel gives you great service.But if you are someone like me, who had stayed here in the past (before it was given out to the new management), then BEWARE,...!This hotel has lost it's old glory and is now focused on catering to the Tourist Groups. The staff at the hotel are all concerned with ensuring that the tourist groups are not inconvenienced and that they have a good time.Also, this hotel is now slightly bent towards catering to the EUROPEAN tourists. But if you are a mere mortal (like me), then this hotel makes sure that they make you feel unwanted. Hell.. even my baggage was not taken to my room as the ""concierge was busy unloading and sending the bags of the tourist group"".Any taxi to be arranged for required me to give them the details the previous day and they would confirm and when you come over the next day at the appointed time, I was told that the taxi was given to ""someone from the tourist group"" because it was important. What was not okay is that no alternate taxi was arranged for me.The other scary place was the reception. Every single time I went there, I was made to feel unwanted. There were so many issues with the room that they gave me that I had to change 3 rooms in 2 days. The final one had a broken bed and it took me 45 minutes to convice the lady at the reception to come to the room and see it for herself. When she did come and see it, you could see she was mortified at what she saw. And her explanationw as ""The house keeping is responsible for it"". Yes, I know it is someone else's job but they are not doing it properly.And when employees start the blame game, as a customer, you better stay away from the place.In a nutshell, this hotel was really really really frustrating. I have advised many of my friends and family who stayed at this property in the past, not to visit this hotel again.","July 2, 2019","3    Ambassador Hotel Bangkok

This time a manager came up and it finally worked. after this the stay was good, the room while small was comfortable (although the bed is way too firm for my liking) The only other negative was when leaving the pool, I was chased down by the attendant for the towel, there were no signs that pool towels could not be taken and as a result I dripped water all the way from the pool deck to my room. this is surely something that housekeeping could have taken the following day.","June 28, 2019","3    Ambassador Hotel Bangkok

184,"This is by far, the worst experience my family has had at a hotel. We are staying in 20+ hotels on this trip, and this one takes the bottom spot. We stayed in the Ocean Wing. They claim the WiFi is free, but it never lets you log in and not a single member of my family was actually able to use it for more than 5 minutes. Completely useless, and had to use data the whole time. Food:In 1 word: inedible. I got sick from the omelette at breakfast, and lunch was a totally different story. This is what I got when I asked for a chicken burger (see attached photo). After arguing with the waitstaff for 5 minutes, they finally replaced it with a totally normal looking chicken breast... meaning they had the right food but decided not to serve it. Service:Everyone seemed miserable and completely unwilling to help. We did not encounter a single friendly employee in our 2 day stay. Building: Most importantly, the facilities are old and run down. It looks like it was built in the 50s-60s, and hasn’t been touched (or thoroughly cleaned) since then. Room:The rooms feel like they came straight out of a 1960s magazine.

193,"Checked in 2 HRs back , sitting in a room which is suffocating. The window open ups to a wall , it’s dark and gloomy - outright depressing. I suffer from claustrophobia and this room started making me sick.I immediately walked to the reception and told the lady I needed to change the room but she checked / rechecked and told me NO ROOM was available till12th June. I was looking to pay for for the upgrade and explained it to her as well.what I clearly understood the one of worst rooms of the hotel was given to us. I am not sure if it was as because we booked through MMT and they did not have a good deal with themI checked sites , and clearly rooms are available and can be booked online. So the lady at the reception was not correct and she must have been working under instructions.What is wrong about the hotel:1. The moment you step out of the elevator u can smell the old and dirty carpets 2.Last done up May Be 25 yrs back property is dated 3. Bed horrible , you can feel the run down springs in the lopsided hard bed. I have spondylitis and I am not sure if I will be ok next morning 4.window opens to a wall, it makes u feel suffocated 5. TV doesn’t work, a technician struggled for a long time and then fixed it6. Very gloomy totally kills your holiday mood .Currently I feel my entire week in Thailand has been ruined by this hotel alone.Room 658","June 5, 2019","3    Ambassador Hotel Bangkok

196,"I stayed in Ambassador hotel for 3 nights from 25th May to 27th May'19. The USP of this hotel is that it is centrally located inn Sukhumvit and within walking distance from numerous Indian food restaurants, NANA train station and BTS skyrail station. Terminal 21 mall is just 5 to 10 minutes walking from this hotel and it is a must visit. The only drawback is the air conditioning system of this hotel as it is simply disaster. I stayed in room no. 343 with my AC thermostat set at 10 degree Celsius and it was feeling like 26 degrees (checked in my G Shock)!. I complained twice and an engineer came and checked but nothing happened. On last night of my stay, engineer simply advised me to change the room which I reluctantly didn't do as it was the last night and i had to early checkout next day. Other than air conditioning, overall this hotel is nice with direct access to 24 hour stores like 7/11 etc.","June 2, 2019","3    Ambassador Hotel Bangkok

The rooms however need a bit of an upgrade, especially the aircon but were clean. I wouldn’t consider this a 4 star hotel, more of a 3 star but for the price we paid it was good value. Though the staff were friendly and the concierge staff were very helpful, it would have been nice if the reception staff would’ve given us a little run down of the hotels facilities when we checked in (minor gripe only).

201,"I booked 4 rooms in the hotel (not the tower wing) as the location was close to Nana and it was affordable. I had informed them earlier that i would like to have early check-in. They gave us one room when we were ready to pay for 4 rooms. anyways, we got another room around 13.00 pm and we took remaining 2 rooms around 9.00 pm as the 2 rooms were still not ready till 2.30 pm and we decided to go for out for shopping. Rooms:We got all four rooms on 6th floor. The rooms are old and dated and have very poor ventilation system. The AC on the floor does not work properly, we had called the technical for 2 nights out of four but the issues persisted in all the rooms. I changed my room once for AC related issue. I other room given to me 663 had slightly better AC but overall AC system was very very poor. In room 663, water reversed from bathroom drain and the bathroom was filled with dirty water. When I called housekeeping, they mentioned that they only clean the room once in the morning. I had to call them 4-5 times just to explain the issue, the supervisor said that he will send some person but no one turned up for 45 minutes, I felt like leaving the hotel but two other families were also with me. finally I went to reception and blasted them, then finally the supervisor and housekeeping persons visited the room and cleared the clogged bathroom. Staff and Service:Staff was very rude. I had a bad experience with hotel technical team. We had 3 rooms together but the floor supervisor all the time asked us to keep the door closed, I don't know why?? The reception was not able to handle the guest. It is more like a hostel, you just pay for the room and then its your headache. Breakfast: Very limited spread, the worst breakfast I ever had in Bangkok.Overall:Please avoid the hotel it is not even a 2 star property, there are far better hotels in the vicinity.","May 23, 2019","3    Ambassador Hotel Bangkok

219,Ambassador HotelWanted a hotel a little nicer than the Nana Hotel this time so I booked the Ambassador based on internet reviews it was middle of the road thought I'd give it a try. I stayed here years ago and to be honest I don't recall how it was back then but it must have been okay because I decided on it again.I got here about 12:30 and expected to have to wait until 2 p.m. to check in such wasn't the case the counter girls were very efficient had me checked in within a matter of minutes and up to the room. The room is very basic as the picture Show but it's very clean very good water pressure good air conditioning cable television with many many channels and mattresses are firm nice linen extra pillows.Has an in-room safe small refrigerator no mini bar items which is a plus in my book plenty of room to put what I want in the refrigerator. At a cost of about $45 a night us I'm pretty happy. Location is very good as well restaurants shops bars massage parlors anything you would possibly need within a short walk.It has a very nice pool area plenty of Sun deck chairs and also something unique just off the pool they've got a children's playroom / Nursery to keep the kids entertained very nice touch. Actually the only downside of the whole stay with the fact that the pool was more like a sauna and a Jacuzzi it was very very warm almost hot not refreshing at all. As it sat in direct sunlight in the weather has been very hot it's really no one to blame for that but it just wasn't real comfortable to swim in due to the temperature of the water.I will be sure to use the Ambassador again if we're rating on the five star scale I would give it a four. Only thing that kept it from a 5 is while the bathroom is very clean and functional it does look like it could use a remodel.,"May 6, 2019","3    Ambassador Hotel Bangkok

232,"The best thing about Ambassador Hotel is the location. It is located on soi 11, a little away from main road, midway between nana plaza and soi cowboy and very near to nana BTS station. There are many Indian restaurants nearby like Bawarchi or DosaKing (pure veg). Room size is very good, it is carpeted but due to low roof height, it might seem smaller. Bathrooms is adequate size though it could have been bigger and has a sliding door instead of traditional and not all rooms have bathtubs. TV is a basic model and you get few Indian channels on cable TV. Room has enough electrical point for charging phone, laptop etc. and has adequate lighting. Bed is ok and side lamps are provided for night reading. A mini fridge and two water bottles along with tea coffee powder and an electric kettle is provided. The clothing rack is not very big but the locker is of adequate size to store the valuables. The hotel has nice gym and a medium size pool with clear water, pool chairs with umbrellas and a small reading section next to it. It has few shops for buying gems, stitching clothes etc. There is a restaurant and a cafe but I never used them so cannot comment on their quality. The rooms in the tower wing are new and better. Make sure you stay in the tower wing. The lobby and reception area is huge and has large seating space with a very large reception counter. However it seems to have been understaffed and in case of check-in of large groups (which is often), the total time taken is quite substantial. It would be better to have separate counters for solo, small family and separate counter for big group check-in. The hotel charges a deposit fee of 1000 Baht at the time of check in and refunds it during check out. Air conditioning in the room seemed to be slow and it took long time for the room to get cooled even when i set the temperature to 18 degrees and fan to highest speed. The cleaning lady comes everyday and replenishes the bath and toiletries in the room. There is an iron table just in case needed and laundry bags for giving clothes for laundry. Room service is available.","May 1, 2019","3    Ambassador Hotel Bangkok

242,"First hotel we visited in Bangkok, very impressed with how easily we could get there from the airport via public transport, despite trying to be conned by private hire car company in airport, as there was a free boat service running every 30 minutes from the closet train station. When we arrived they were very attentive and welcoming. Really enjoyed our stay as in good location and the hotel itself had very good facilities and the service was of high standard. We opted to have breakfast each morning, which had a wide variety of western food and Thai food, however the fruit selection wasn’t as good as other hotels we visited while in Thailand. We were given a welcome drink voucher to use in hotel bars however the option were all not alcoholic. Views from rooms and rooftop bar were well a visit.","July 7, 2019","4    Chatrium Hotel Riverside Bangkok

244,"We had a lengthy stay in the Chatrium Riverside from March to May this year. We stayed in a river view suite which was excellent. We enjoyed watching the boats on the river. The living area was spacious and the bed very comfortable. The kitchenette very useful with a toddler. The house-keeping team left the suite spotless every day. Tanyarat was very accommodating and checked what time was best for her to clean the room as our new daughter napped during the day. The pool area was also child friendly with good shallow areas for young children.The location was excellent, an oasis in Bangkok, and the Chatrium boat provided quick and regular access to Saphan Taksin Pier where you could get the BTS or a short walk to the department store and supermarket, or even hop on another short boat trip to the new Icon Siam Mall.The hotel staff was excellent, extremely friendly and always greeted us with a smile. From the moment we arrived, we were greeted by the friendly security guards and concierge team. Unfortunately we did not get everyone's name but a special mention to Mighty and Q.We needed to extend our stay due to circumstances beyond our control and Khun Supachai at reception made sure this was stress free.The River Barge restaurant was so good we ate there morning and most nights. There was a great variety of food and everything was excellent. There was musical entertainment every night which we all loved, particularly our daughter! On our arrival, the hosts always ensured we had our choice of table. The staff was friendly and accommodating and provided our daughter with whatever she needed. I was even presented with a cake to celebrate my first Mother’s day! Too many to name everyone, but a special thanks to Khun K, Spencer, Amy, Ice, M and Reem. We found the Lobby Lounge to be a lovely spot to relax in at any time of the day, with a tempting selection of sweet and savoury treats. The staff was also extremely friendly and a Thai iced tea is not to be missed.The owners should be proud of their staff - we got to know many of the staff and they made our stay even more memorable.Thanks to all in the Chatrium Riverside, we look forward to our return!","July 6, 2019","4    Chatrium Hotel Riverside Bangkok

245,"I work in he Middle East and once a year I try to visit family and whanau in Aotearoa / New Zealand. It's a long trip so if I have time, it's really nice to break it up. I have stayed at this hotel twice before – once through booking and the secondfamily and whanau time in a rush to leave a Bangkok hotel that turned out to be quite dodgy. I’m glad to say it’s still a treat. Staff is knowledgeable and pleasant and the place is kept in good form. I chose not to get the room cleaned every day as am not especially messy but many thanks to Kuakul of the housekeeping team for her professionalism, friendliness, most welcome short introductory Thai lesson and charming gift of Thai sweets. From the surrounding gardens and the pier to the swimming pools floor right up to the 36th floor restaurant one can enjoy great views and good hospitality. Do be aware of when the pool floor closes. I missed it one night and though kind of happy to be harboured there all night, I worried about getting into trouble so found a services elevator back up to my floor. Access to other parts of the city is easy due to the free ferry and a nearby railway station. I enjoyed walking around the neighborhood and imbibing in great cuisine at obviously non-hotel prices. Thoughtfully the hotel provides guests with a map and a wee bilingual card for taxi drivers in case of getting lost and experiencing language barriers. I’ve always had a city view room as opposed to a river view room as tend to book special discounts, however this hasn’t been too disappointing. My only criticism is petty but it has to do with the wild blue, black and yellow abstract carpet in the room I last stayed in. Who cares though as along with the whole hotel it was clean and comfortable. The yellow couch was a nice touch. Bravo to The Chatrium and its staff.","July 5, 2019","4    Chatrium Hotel Riverside Bangkok

276,"We have stayed at The Chatrium many times since our initial honeymoon stay in 2010. We now live on the outskirts of Bangkok, and frequently spend a night ‘in town’ - more often than not at The Chatrium. The pool overlooking the Chao Phraya is the best in Bangkok - plenty of shade, but you can easily soak up the sun if you want to. We have stayed in one and two bedroom suites with our two children - both provide ample room for all of us. The one beds are very good value, but I do consider the two beds to be a little overpriced. In our experience, even the ‘city view’ rooms afford a view of the river - albeit from a bit of an angle - and the balconies on all of the rooms give a great view of the city and/or river. The breakfast provided is comprehensive - great Asian and Continental choices, and an effort made for bacon, eggs etc...In all honesty, there are no negatives to speak of. I am fussy, and will contact management if I have any minor issues. They are always exceedingly responsive and go above and beyond to rectify any gripe. I would definitely recommend a stay here.","June 14, 2019","4    Chatrium Hotel Riverside Bangkok

297,"We stayed in the Rembrandt in June 2019 and we were really surprised by this hotel! Firstly, when we arrived at the hotel, the staff were very friendly and welcoming and took our bags inside from the taxi for us and delivered them immediately to our rooms. For check in, we arrived at the main reception desk where we were guided upstairs to the executive lounge (because we stayed in executive rooms) we took a seat and were given a glass of juice upon arrival. While seated we were given a quick form to fill in and that was it we were checked in. We were especially grateful as we arrived early in the morning after a very long journey and we were able to get into the rooms early.The rooms are clean, spacious and very well decorated. We had two rooms in our party and they managed to situate them next door to each other meaning we were close to each other making it a lot easier. The rooms are very well equipped with everything you would need. A mini bar with reasonable prices compared to other hotel minibars, hairdryer, plug sockets with built in adapters so a variety of plugs can be used, a clever light switch next to the bed that allowed all the lights to be turned off from your bed along with air con controls and even an alarm. My favourite feature of the rooms was the “handy” phone that was in each room. It’s an excellent feature that should be used in every hotel! It’s a smartphone that sits on a dock in your room that you can take out and about with you. It has full 4g connectivity and allows free international phone calls. It also features many guides to eating and the activity’s in Bangkok. We took this everywhere with us and used it multiple times for googling without the need to find WiFi. Included in the executive rooms was access to the executive lounge. We thought this was a brilliant idea as it was a place to meet people in your group from different rooms before going out, including happy hour where a selection of soft and alcoholic drinks were available for free. Other items such as fresh fruit and snacks were also available. The breakfast in the hotel was situated in the Mexican restaurant. This was a really good breakfast and had a massive range of fresh food available. Eggs and pancakes being made to order, variety of fresh juices and other breakfast items. Also a suitable amount for vegetarians. The other facilities of the hotel were excellent. The pool was a decent size with a suitable number of sun beds and clean towels for use. Other features such as the use of the tuk tuk up to the main road from the hotel, it doesn’t seem like a long journey but saved a lot of walking!! We also were offered umbrellas to take out when it was raining which was a nice touch. The location of the hotel is also very good, as mentioned before the tuk tuk is a free service which takes you up to the main road where you can find a 7-eleven for food and drink, taxis and tuk tuks for reasonable prices and also a short walk to the sky train for easy access to the majority of Bangkok. I would recommend a visit to the sky bar on the roof of the Rembrandt, it’s not very big however it’s a hidden jewel with not many people knowing about it’s excellent views, music and drinks!! I would highly recommend a visit to the Rembrandt and would love to return for another trip to the hotel at a later date.","July 3, 2019","5    Rembrandt Hotel & Suites Bangkok

298,"My wife and I recently visited Bangkok for the first time and had booked a one bedroom suite at this hotel. To cut down a long story:One and two bedroom suites are in a building at the back which are disgusting, filthy and smelly (2*)To ask for another room is to be told that each building is managed separately and management are not available at the time we arrived - 9pm.The above is not true and a manager will only reveal themselves after hiding behind poor staff when you make it clear you will be wanting to speak to them the next day.You will be offered a cheaper but nicer room in the main building (4*) but no refund in difference will be offered.No visit will be made to inspect your shoddy room as they already know it’s bad.No apology will be offered for the state of your roomMy wife being exhausted and visibly upset makes no difference to the management of this hotel.A direct complaint to Warwick Hotel Group will never be responded to - I wrote to them the same night that was two weeks ago.To end on a more pleasant note, the deluxe room was nice (as mentioned previously) and the breakfast was also top-notch offering a wide selection including a fresh egg station which was much appreciated. All the staff (aside from the “manager”) were lovely.My bottom-line advice is not to book a room in the second crappy building ( a 2* establishment at best) which comprises of one and two bedroom suites. Much better to pick a room in the main building which all seem lovely. ","July 2, 2019","5    Rembrandt Hotel & Suites Bangkok

301,"This is the second time we have stayed here and as the last time, the hotel didn't disappoint. The service is fantastic and the rooms very spacious. However, I believe the rooms are due for an upgrade as they are looking very tired. They have everything that you could possibly want or need, not only in the rooms but throughout the hotel itself, with several Restaurants, pool and fantastic cocktail bar. The location is perfect and very close to Terminal One Shopping Centre. It is a great neighbourhood with plenty of Restaurants around it. Apple and Mos on Reception were great and their smiles made you feel more than welcome. My only complaint would be that they offer to get you a Taxi, yet dont insist that they use their meters. In fact I would suggest that there is a kickback for the staff. It cost us 500 Baht to get to the airport as advised by hotel staff, yet we know damn well it should have only been around 300 Baht as we were charged this going to the hotel. I think management needs to investigate this practice. However, I would definitely recommend this hotel.","June 27, 2019","5    Rembrandt Hotel & Suites Bangkok

309,"We stayed here for 3 nights at the start of our Thailand holiday with friends, we arrived after our flight from London really tired and hoped we could get our room early but we're told that we had booked a deluxe room and it wouldn't be ready till 2 pm (it was only 10am) but if we paid an extra 1200 baht per night we could have an executive room immediately, we did and were so glad we found it excellent value. Our room was on the 25th floor with great views of the city and one floor down was the executive lounge where you could have breakfast made to order and each evening was a buffet with free drinks including wine, beer and spirits, one floor up was the sky bar which has great night time views of the city. The room was very clean and with a wonderfull bathroom with everything you could wish for, another excellent idea is that you switch on a light in your room to tell housekeeping to come to clean room so it's very convenient for you. We found its in a really good location for getting around the city and as there were four of us we didn't need to argue about the cost of taxis/tuk tuks etc but you could easily use the sky train or subway. We used the hotel's tour desk to visit the grand palace etc with our own guide who was brilliant. We found drinks quite expensive in the bars but was nice to have a night cap after a night out.

312,Room was fine breakfast was ok and the room was cheap. To be honest we only did 1 night and spent little time here but it's really close to the sky train. We didn't know what we was doing but here's some tips. Remember the stop u need for hotel is Asok easy a sock. Buy a day ticket. Goto Siam then change to saphan taksin signposts everywhere it's simple. Here you can get the hop on off boat up the river for 200 baht day ticket. Just goto each stop some are temples some are malls and the palace is here too. Koha sang road is the last stop. Hop back on to take you back down to the sky train. The hotel gives you a phone to use free for Google maps and the like. It sounds daunting but it's really really easy which is hard to explain but once you start you'll suss it out no problem.

319,I booked this place on Hotels.com because it was listed as a 5* and was only $60 per night. When I arrived the lobby was very nice and air conditioned. Trust me you want ac when visiting Bangkok as its very hot and humid at all hours of the day. My room was good sized and the ac controls were digital. It even had a desk so I could map out my sightseeing tours easily. The pool and gym were very nice and had a restaurant there as well. The only reason I gave it 4 vs 5 stars is they wouldn’t allow me to bring a girl I met up to my room. They have a strict policy on visitors. As a single guy you want to be able to bring a girl home at night if you get lucky. Not sure I’d stay here again unless I get married. LoL. The hotel is in walking distance to Soi Cowboy which is great for people watching and bar girls. Some of the bathrooms around the city have the bum guns but no tp so be prepared for a new bathroom experience you won’t forget. I actually installed on in my home when I got back to America. ,"June 5, 2019","5    Rembrandt Hotel & Suites Bangkok

323,"We had just a couple of days in Bangkok before proceeding to our main holiday. Rembrandt is a very good hotel.Charges are straight forward and clear.Beautiful lobby.Slightly dated floor carpets / paneling on upper floor lobbies.Clean and neat overall.Excellent bathrooms, except for bath tubs.The shower and tub are a unit, but the tub is placed really high. Its very hard to get into and out. Older people should be really really careful.Smaller rooms, with some city views and pool views.Because of the location, obviously we are surrounded by sky scrapers. And see all the buildings from up there.Pool is pretty decent, with an attendant taking care of towels. The attendant also goes around asking for food / drink orders from the Mexican restaurant next to the pool.There are two or three restaurants inside. Tip: Always include breakfast when you book a room, unless you are leaving too early for breakfast.Breakfast spread is very good for both vegetarians and non vegetarians. There is even a small deli section with meats, cheeses, salads and fruits. I saw some creamy blue cheese.","May 31, 2019","5    Rembrandt Hotel & Suites Bangkok

324,"We arrived early and were allowed early check – in, however the room they had allocated was a 1 bedroom apartment as opposed to the family room we had booked. As there wasn’t a bed for the children, they upgraded us to a 2 bedroom apartment, which was large, and had a kitchen with fridge and washer / dryer which came in handy as we were there for the full 3 days of Songkran which involved lots of water being sprayed or thrown at you every time you left the hotel.The first day was fun and we joined in with the water fights however after 3 days it became a bit tiresome and meant it was difficult to walk around looking for bars and restaurants as you would be soaked through. The hotel staff were helpful and friendly. Our room was in a separate building that they called ‘the towers’ and breakfast was in the main building but it’s just around the corner. There is a really good ‘7 Eleven’ shop next to the towers, under the same canopy,which sold water and lots of basic goods at a really cheap price.Because of Songkran we ate in the hotel more than I had wanted and they proved to be quite expensive. Everything you order has a 10% service charge and 7% tax added to it.The Italian restaurant near the pool on level 4 of the main building was nice and the pool itself was great. There is another pool on level 11 of the towers but this didn’t get much sun, not many people used it and it wasn’t staffed.The only negative about the hotel was that they add 3000baht (£75) to your credit card then refund it around 2 weeks later, I had put this on my travel card so wasn’t able to spend this amount until it went back onto the card. It should be refunded immediately when you check out.Overall a good hotel, nice large beds, everything you could need, good location, good air-con, helpful staff, prices are expensive for food and drink for Thailand (Wine is v expensive in Thailand as its mainly New Zealand wine at around £8 for a small glass)","May 23, 2019","5    Rembrandt Hotel & Suites Bangkok

We ate at the Italian restaurant one night next to the pool and have to give a special thank you to Chef Mam for the fabulous pizza! The rooftop bar is stunning and the service impeccable. I can highly recommend the cocktails, especially the one with cotton candy. It’s not as sweet as you would think!The only slight issue we had was during check in and check out. The staff are friendly, obviously busy, but answering the phone mid check in and again on check out and wandering off is not acceptable. It left some poor other member of staff to try and sort paying the bill, getting the keys etc. This needs improving.On the whole I would easily recommend this hotel and if ever in Bangkok again I would stay here.","May 21, 2019","5    Rembrandt Hotel & Suites Bangkok

327,I would rate Rembrant 3.5 Stars. This Hotel is well priced for what you get. This hotel certainly has some advantages. A handy location and plenty of choices for dining. With an executive suite we had lots of space and a big balcony. What lets it down is the saggy old mattress on the bed. I could literally feel the imprint of where hundreds of other people had slept before me. It's time for a new mattress!! We also had issues with ants in our room.

On arrival we received a bunch of flowers and a bowl of fruit in a room that seemed to be a larger upgraded room. A lovely touch, and thanks to all the staff. The room overlooked the swimming pool which looked nice but unfortunately we just didn’t get the time to use it. The hotel is kept very clean and we had no problems at all. Staff were always friendly and opened doors every time.The location is very good, being less than a 10 minute walk to the sky train. Bangkok is very busy and it’s difficult to get anywhere fast so it’s good to have great access from this hotel to transport links. There are a couple of restaurants nearby too. We had bed and breakfast, which again was very good, plenty of choice too and always more than enough. Overall a very good experience in a very nice traditional hotel, parts of which perhaps need upgrading slightly but nothing major. We visited the 1826 rooftop bar on two of the three evenings, sampling the great cocktails which had a nice twist. A little expensive but it’s what you expect for a rooftop bar in a major city.

Nothing to complain about, I had a good stay.The only things I think could do with improvement are:1. The breakfast could be more interesting, using local produce and dishes. I found it very boring and after the first day, just had the toast and ate outside. The fresh fruits were nice though.2. The water temperature in the shower cannot be controlled as the shower mechanism is fixed too high. Normally the water temperature is suite for the air-conditioned room, but sometimes I may want to have a cooler or hotter shower.3. It will be good if you provided a soap or a handwash at the basin located outside the shower area.

The hot water isn't very hot but ample for a shower and wash your hair. There is a safe in the room. Breakfast was a nice suprise with cooked options available, fruit and yoghurt.

376,"This place really is great for a few nights stay in Bangkok. It’s not highly luxurious but you can tell it’s fairly new and modern. The place is very clean and cosy. The staff at breakfast are lovely. The breakfast itself is quite basic but does the job if you’re only staying for a few nights since there isn’t that many options. It was in a nice area away from the hustle of the city and the street markets are at walking distance. They also do daily service in your room. The only negative thing I can say is that at check out they went to inspect the room and one of the hotel cleaners returned to reception with our towels. They had some make up smudge on them but wasn’t anything beyond unusual. It’s really normal to get some make up on your towel by accident after a shower. However the receptionist was saying we had to pay for the towels? Clearly they just needed to wash them. After some back and forth they let us off. I wasn’t going to pay for a towel only because it needed to be washed. If it’s broken or damaged I get it. But dirty is something every hotel assumes responsibility for after the guests have left. What left us a little unsettled was that after agreeing that we wouldn’t pay... I said in Thai “ok thank you” and the guy replied with “no no thank you” followed by a laugh, implying some negative attitude and childish immaturity towards us. I didn’t recall it the first time so when I did it a second time and he replied the same way followed by quite a nasty laughter I realised they were definitely giving us attitude. Don’t get me wrong, the place itself is great and this was the only thing that was negative about it. But I think guests who plan to stay here should be aware that they do inspections when you’re checking out and that you should definitely be present when they do incase they come back with anything they will want to charge you with. So although the stay was overall pleasant and we loved the people doing the breakfast service, we wouldn’t stay again due to the attitude the male receptionist gave us at the end, which unfortunately left a bitter after taste.

407,"We checked in at 8:20pm, that was a fast and efficient experience. On check in we mentioned that my husband was being picked up to go on tour at 6am the next day. Absolutely no problem for check in person to organise a breakfast box for him to take the next morning (delicious). This morning he got picked up at 6:30am - breakfast doesn't open until 6:30am but it was no problem for us to go and eat at 6:15am. Every staff member we met or saw was friendly and professional, wherever we were in the hotel. I made a direct comparison with the hotel next door, the Rembrandt, where we stayed last year, when I wrote this review. Staff at Park Plaza much better - staff next door disinterested when we were there and raising a smile from them was such hard work!Our room 721 was modern and not tired. As expected in Bangkok, no picturesque view but a bit of open space between our room and the car park we looked into, with even the tops of a few green trees in view. Last year next door, our room was tired and we looked straight into a concrete wall. Both places very clean and the only thing I could get a bit precious about at Park Plaza is the one small cake of soap supplied which was almost used up the first night and non existent for night two. However, other than that Housekeeping was excellent.The pool - much smaller than the photos depict and we thought uninviting and that was better next door - about the only thing. We don't come to Bangkok to swim, so we weren't bothered. My husband booked a tour with the tour desk last night for early pick up today. We chose convenience over price which was likely cheaper outside. Tour desk man naturally smiley, efficient and professional. Confirmation immediate. We have also stayed in the other Park Plaza hotel in Bangkok, on the R.. road. This one is much quieter as Soi 18 is not so busy but just as handy to Asoke/Sukhumvit station. Thank you Park Plaza Soi 18. Brilliant!!","June 26, 2019","7    Park Plaza Bangkok Soi 18

It’s situation is perfect for visiting local bars/sights, within walking distance. The staff were above and beyond with friendly service. We left our laundry at a nearby laundrette, we were unable to collect it before flying back to the UK due to a public holiday!! We contacted the hotel and they swiftly arranged to collect and send our laundry back to our home address. We received it this morning. Thank you so much Radison, so polite and swift with a correspondence. Could not recommend highly enough. A pleasure to have stayed there.","June 24, 2019","7    Park Plaza Bangkok Soi 18

The breakfast was plentiful and good selection with excellent staff. The hotel organised a dinner river cruise for us as well as a driver for the day to take us anywhere we wanted around Bangkok. The concierge staff were great, friendly and knowledgeable. We used the pool bar for lunch and drinks which was reasonably priced and good food, we used the pool which was great and the gym.

It was quick and easy to get to MBK for some shopping using the train. The hotel transfer is expensive and we paid 500bhat for a green & yellow taxi. Its much cheaper compared to the hotels 1600 bhat we were quoted.We didnt have the breakfast as we ate out. There are restaurants on the side road and the main street.

414,"What can I say. If you stay at a place like Park Plaza you want everything to be convenient. And if not you want things to be solved without argument? What can I tell? You’llfind it here.I stayed at Park Plaza soi 18 several nights in 2019. I’ve been welcomed by a very friendly staff. I had a clean room and for the few times something was missing (minor things like a missing towel, never anything to complain about) the issue had been solved instantly. OK, breakfast could be better but I hardly go for that.BTW: Don’t mix the place up with the Park Plaza at Soi 16. This place is far more recommendable.The only downside: Don’t expect much of a view from your room. Apart from that: Great location (Maybe 6 minutes from Asok/Sukhumvit public transport, nice and friendly staff, comfortable and clean room, nice pool.

419,"My wife and I stayed at this hotel in June. We chose this hotel for its proximity to a number of authentic Thai restaurants since we both love Thai food. The hotel has a lot going for it. It is located in the relatively quiet Soi 18 but within walking distance of everything. The hotel is large enough to have great facilities (gym, spa, pool, great breakfast) but small enough to have personalised service. The rooms are large and comfortable with great amenities, a large high pressure shower (quite rare in this price range) with a good work area for business travellers. The rooftop pool and bar were wonderful as was the breakfast spread. The only letdown was the painfully slow internet speed, although I would imagine that his can be easily resolved.

The carpentry in the rooms showed some sign of aging. However the beds are clean and bathroom fittings are well maintained. Hot shower water gets warm fast which is excellent. The aircon in the suite room is a bit noisy, but it did not affect our sleep quality. We had 3days buffet breakfast included. There is different hot food every day, same staples like bread, salad and fruits. The food tastes good especially the pink coconut vemecelli. The dinning team shows service standard in making sure they get the orders right.There is one male staff who noticed the cold drink i usually self-service at the counter and served it to me at my table without me asking.

446,"The past 8 years, it always has felt like coming back home when staying at Park Plaza Sukhumvit Soi 18. The hotel has a great location (located in a relaxed side street of Sukhumvit, close to the Subway (MRT), Skytrain (BTS), Airport Link (Makassan Station)) whereby shopping venues and nightlife are only a short walking distance away (even without the complimentary hotel tuk tuk ride to the main road)!Staying at this hotel, makes you feels cared for like a celebrity at 5-star hotel! The mid-size (125 rooms) of the hotel creates a personal and cozy atmosphere and the excellent modern facilities throughout the hotel (which very well maintained - still looks/feels as when it opened in 2011) certainly contribute towards this feeling. But what makes this hotel outstanding in Bangkok (for each type of traveler) are the superb, attentive and kind staff members (of each department) that all seem very engaged with there jobs! Their passion for work and eye for details will be most remembered by guests, and I have had plenty of such occasions!Finally, the swimming pool, gym and bar area at the top floor is always a great place to relax in the middle of busy Bangkok, both during the day and (late) night.

449,"After many years of travelling to Bangkok I finally discovered this little gem of a hotel inthe heart of Sukhumvit. Park Plaza 18 has a nondescript entrance but don’t let that fool you. The moment you step into its lobby you feel like you have entered a stylish boutique hotel. The double-height ceiling gives a feeling of airy spaciousness and the glassed wall on one side let’s daylight in to make the lobby nice and bright. The rooms were elegantly fitted with a spacious bed and bathroom to make it a welcome treat after a flight. The rooftop pool and bar were tastefully done and just the right place to enjoy sundowners before dinner. Finally, the mezzanine restaurant where a large spread for breakfast is laid out was outstanding. Step out of the hotel and top-end shopping awaits you at the Emporium store nearby and next to it the Helix where top class eateries can satisfy the most demanding palate. Location of the hotel couldn’t be better - most convenient by any yardstick. ","April 6, 2019","7    Park Plaza Bangkok Soi 18

From the moment you arrive, you cannot help but feel embraced by warm Thai hospitality. The rooms are tastefully decorated in modern neutral tones, with elements of Thai culture infused throughout. I stayed in the M Suite, which offers access to the signature M Club on the 31st floor. Without question, the M Club at this property stands out among other Marriott properties. Beyond the excellent food and beverage offerings, which change on a daily basis and revolve around 7 culinary themes, the service in the M Club exceeded all expectations. Always warm and hospitable, the M Club staff were attentive to every need and driven to make each guests stay a memorable one — this was very clear. Of note, Maithai and Saipan were true ambassadors of Marriott’s mission for excellence in hospitality. They went above and beyond to make a personal connection with guests that allowed them to cater the guest experience to an exceptionally elevated level. These two exuded hospitality to an extent that was impressive to say the least.Already looking forward to returning to this iconic property very soon!","July 3, 2019","8    Bangkok Marriott Hotel The Surawongse

465,"Had a brief 2 night stay at this fairly new property. It’s off the main strip which is great so you do get some respite from Bangkok’s crazy traffic. Had a nice room on the 22nd floor with a nice view out to the river. It’s close enough to the main Silom strip, the hotel offers a shuttle to the Skytrain station but stick with Grab and you should be just fine. Close enough to the offices and shops at the Siam area. There is a 7-11 right across the road for snacks and medicines at all times.Check in was quick and efficient, the staff seemed to be universally quite nice, housekeeping was efficient and the staff at the rooftop bar was quite accommodating and helpful with drinks suggestions. The room is a good size with a huge couch that goes the entire length of the window, it does however also provide the only seating if you want to use the desk to work from your room. Not ideal but not completely horrible either. Mattress was the right level of firmness and the blackout blinds were super effective.Food at the restaurant downstairs for breakfast was extensive and tasty, nice juice bar as well. The room service was fantastic and quick, the food at Yao at the rooftop was good but average when you consider the prices and what’s available on the street outside. Loved it and hope to visit again soon.","June 22, 2019","8    Bangkok Marriott Hotel The Surawongse

Staff are helpful and friendly and whilst the range of food for me as a vegan at breakfast seemed limited on day one, the waiters and waitresses were super-helpful in preparing me a special smoothie (strawberry, passion fruit, banana and soya milk now you ask), a lovely vegetable stir-fry. Breakfast here isn't cheap but it was a highlight of the day. Particular thanks to the two managers, and also Apple, Taweechai and Aom. Rooms are great; roof-top bar good and the area near the pool particularly pleasant to spend time during the day or evening. 15 minute walk to the BTS which probably puts some off, but they do offer a free lift there if that's what you need.

472,"I stayed at Marriott Surawongse for the first time and I would concur with other reviews that it is a very good hotel although like other places it is not perfect and I think the #1 rating on TripAdvisor out of 1000+ hotels in Bangkok is a bit overdone. The quick summary is that room upgrades are among the most generous in the city, but the Platinum breakfast benefit is subpar.I booked the entry level room and as Ambassador elite guest I was upgraded to the 2-bedroom apartment which I was very pleased with. Our room was at the end of the hallway so very quiet and combined with the good soundproofing we did not hear a thing during our entire stay. At 95 square meters this room is very spacious; while we did not need the second bedroom, we had two full bathrooms which is very convenient and is a feature that we only found in the suites at Sheraton Grande Sukhumvit before; suites at other hotels in Bangkok generally only have 1 or 1.5 bath. One of the bathrooms was shower only and the other had a tub in the shower enclosure. For people on a long stay, there is a washer/dryer in a closet which turned out to be very useful for us. You can call reception and they bring detergent for laundry. While St.Regis’s laundry benefit of 4 free pieces per person per day is hard to beat, having the ability to do our laundry ourselves beats all other hotels besides St.Regis. The room also has a small kitchen with appliances, pots and pans so everything needed to cook, plus a full-size fridge. The living room is between the two bedrooms and there is a dining room with a large table and six chairs. The room is well designed and functional as can be expected from a new hotel (opened only one year ago) with international power plugs near the beds for example. I also liked the local Thai designs on some walls and shower doors as well to avoid the room being bland cookie-cutter. The M-lounge on the 31st floor has great views of the city and can be accessed 24 hours a day with the key card which is great if you have jet lag or want a bottle of water during the night. You can see Chao Praya river in the distance and the riverside hotels such as Sheraton Royal Orchid and Millenium Hilton. There are three main sitting areas with good spacing between tables and several of them near the windows so if you arrive early you can have a premium spot. We found the lounge to be quite popular and had a good number of guests, but it did not feel as crowded as some other hotels in Bangkok due to the table arrangement, particularly Marriott Marquis, and to a lesser extent JW Marriott and Renaissance. Happy hour is a generous 3 hours for drinks 5:30-8:30pm while hors d’oeuvres are 2 hours 5:30-7:30pm. What is interesting is that they have a country theme each night for happy hour: the first night was American, the second Japanese, and the third was Italian (other days of the week that we did not go are Thai, Chinese, Mexican, and Indian). While American was not exactly to our liking, however I can admit that food quality was good at the carving station with chicken, sausage, and sea bass, and also another dish of chicken with peppercorn sauce and a seared tuna salad. On Japanese night they had curry chicken with rice, miso soup, salmon, and stir-fry noodles with vegetables. Italian night was more disappointing – there would be better Italian options than mac & cheese or meatballs with gravy. They also had a chicken dish that was very similar to two days prior and not good pieces of meat. For drinks they can prepare cocktails which I found to be a plus. Also they have Nua sparkling wine which is the same as offered at Renaissance and now also at Athenee since they downgraded alcohol choices there recently. There was a choice of 2 reds and 2 white wines which were ok – I was glad to find Pinot Noir which not many hotels have. Desserts were plentiful and changed every night. The Platinum (and higher) breakfast benefit is unequivocally the weakness of this hotel. You can have breakfast in the lounge but not in the restaurant. I am aware that they are following the rules, but in this competitive market this is a drawback. At Renaissance for example they decided to be more generous than the rules and they allow breakfast in the lounge OR restaurant. If the lounge breakfast at Marriott Surawongse was as extensive as Renaissance’s lounge breakfast, limiting breakfast to the lounge could still be fine, but unfortunately it is not. The offerings are quite modest, comparable to Grand Hyatt and Hyatt Regency Sukhumvit. At those two Hyatts I never have breakfast in the lounge despite the lounge being more quiet than the restaurant, simply because there is not enough choice particularly the lack of Asian options. The big difference is that both GH and HR give more than the Hyatt Globalist rules by allowing breakfast in the restaurant downstairs as an alternative to the lounge, unlike Marriott Surawongse. Bottom line, all of this makes the breakfast benefit at Marriott Surawongse one of the weakest in the hotel chains that I know of in Bangkok (Marriott, Hyatt, Hilton, and Accor). Of course you can pay 1300 THB for a couple for breakfast in the restaurant but Platinum guests having to pay for breakfast might not make a lot of sense; you would probably be better off spending that extra 1300 THB for a hotel with a higher price point such as one of the two Luxury Collection properties (SGS or Athenee) where you will enjoy a more luxurious hotel in addition to having free breakfast in the restaurant as a side benefit. For guests who would not get free breakfast in the restaurant regardless where they go (Gold members or lower), then my comments above are probably irrelevant and breakfast won’t be as much of a drag on value. Back to breakfast in the lounge, the choice of fruits is quite limited and there was nothing special for example no mangoes, no passion fruits, no pomelo, no berries, etc. There are veggies but mostly cold, unlike many hotels which have a warm vegetarian dish such as morning glory or stir-fried veggies. They have western choices such as sausage, bacon, and potatoes but that is not what I am looking for in Bangkok. One of the rare positives about breakfast is the noodle soup station which was decent. However there are no noodles / fried rice / fish dishes available in the lounge except at the egg station you can have an omelet with rice. I have been to Royal Orchid Sheraton a few times and even though it’s generally a cheaper hotel, the lounge breakfast is better than at Marriott Surawongse by a long shot, not even mentioning that ROS also offers breakfast in the restaurant. My takeaway is that Marriott Surawongse might have the weakest breakfast benefit of the entire chain besides perhaps Aloft and Four Points which I have never tried before.Service at the Marriott Surawongse was good particularly in the lounge where staff was friendly and helpful. Housekeeping was done exactly at the time I requested each day with no miscues. Overall I found that Marriott Surawongse is a good hotel which has its place in the Marriott portfolio. Room upgrades for elite guests are generous and if you value extra space then a suite upgrade at this hotel will likely be among the best you can have in Bangkok. As great as room upgrades are, the breakfast benefit might be the mirror image and one of the weakest I have seen – there are even some select service hotels where I would prefer their breakfast, for example DoubleTree for sure and maybe even perhaps Hyatt Place. So Marriott has clear strengths and weaknesses. If the hotel improved their breakfast policy this property would go up considerably in my relative rankings for Bangkok.","June 12, 2019","8    Bangkok Marriott Hotel The Surawongse

Their M-Club concierge service was very helpful and they went out of their way helping my wife and me. The M-Club’s food was also top notch. We came back late from tours one night and ate at the hotel’s Praha Kitchen and the food and service were very good as well.

My favorite memories of Bangkok are of grabbing a nightcap on the roof with my wife while enjoying the breeze and heat lightening shows over the city. This is truly a remarkable hotel that provided us with memories that will last a lifetime. Thank you so much to the wonderful staff for making our stay memorable!","June 4, 2019","8    Bangkok Marriott Hotel The Surawongse

477,"We stayed at this hotel last May 25 to 28, 2018. It was very new at that time. The room was spacious and had a good design. The infinity pool overlooking the city was also nice. We had drinks at the rooftop bar which had a view of the city. The breakfast buffet also had an extensive selection typical of Marriott hotels. The waiters during breakfast were also very friendly and attentive. The staff at the reception/lobby were warm and friendly as well. The hotel is very near the Nielson Hays library which has a good selection of books for all ages including classical books, books on Southeast Asia and children's books. It is also walking distance to several good restaurants and it is easy to get a taxi to go to other areas of Bangkok, as well as the airport. We had a good stay and will definitely consider this hotel if we are in Bangkok in the future. ","June 1, 2019","8    Bangkok Marriott Hotel The Surawongse

478,"This hotel is just amazing. Really one of the best 5-star hotel experiences I had so far (if not the best!) It’s difficult to compare with other hotels, because everything feels just perfect.I stayed here with a friend for 3 nights.Room: We had an Executive room on the 26th floor (if I remember correctly?). The view on Bangkok here was just stunning. Never had such a great view from the room. Overall, very modern style and super clean.Infinity Pool: The infinity pool offers an amazing view of Bangkok. Also, although the pool is not extremely huge, it was not crowded at all (when I visited end of February/beginning March), which made it very relaxing.Club lounge: We had access to the M Club. What can I say, I was stunned again! Staff extremely friendly, view on Bangkok from the lounge (again!) very nice! There was a spacious outdoor area/balcony that we used most of the time as it’s very cozy. Now, the food in the lounge was such a high-quality that I would go back there just because of that! During breakfast they offered a wide range of cold and warm food. During the afternoon they would have a few sandwiches. But the highlight was the hors d’hoeuvre. I really didn’t expect it to be so good! They served warm food, but you could really dine here. No need to go somewhere else for dinner! And every bite was a highlight, just perfect! They also offered cocktails, wine, etc. during the hors d’hoeuvres. Also, you could get non-alcoholic drinks throughout the opening hours of the lounge. I have to say: best club lounge I’ve ever been to!I will definitely come back when I’m in Bangkok again! CheersHarry","June 1, 2019","8    Bangkok Marriott Hotel The Surawongse

479,"This is a one year old property and though it has a small footprint, it has spacious suites and apartments. I stayed in a one-bedroom apartment which was beautifully furnished with wooden floors, a small kitchen, a small dining table for four and a sofa. There was only one bathroom inside the bedroom with separate shower and bathtub. They provide Thann amenities which was great. However the cleanliness of the room was not so good. There was trash that hadn't been vacuumed and I even found a pair of socks from a previous guest on a dining chair! Clearly the chairs had not been cleaned or inspected.I highly recommend their spa and masseuse APPLE. She was incredible and twisted and turned me in ways I could not imagine possible. All my kinks were out after her highly skilled Thai massage and compress. While the spa is not fancy, they did provide a foot soak to begin the treatment and the room had a shower in it. I also enjoyed a meal at the coffee shop and had a great Tom Yum Kung, perhaps one of the best I have enjoyed although the satays came out cold. Unfortunately the meal was marred by a neighboring guest watching a loud video. They really should not allow loud and noisy video watching.","May 26, 2019","8    Bangkok Marriott Hotel The Surawongse

480,"I first heard about the Bangkok Marriott Hotel The Surawongse from my nephew who had stayed there a few months earlier and he said I have to try out this amazing new hotel in Bangkok!As he only stays in the best luxury hotels I took his recommendation seriously and booked the hotel for my next trip to Bangkok. From the moment I arrived at the entrance I was greeted with that famous Thai smile and instantly felt welcome, a great start. The Check-in was fast and was in my room within 5 minutes of arriving which is always a good thing as I had just travelled for 25hrs!The suite was a perfect retreat from Bangkok below and all the rooms including the bathroom had amazing sunset views.There is a number of great dining options in this hotel and I will review Yao Restaurant & Rooftop Bar in more detail, but this is the No.1 option if you like Chinese food… A real treat!The Rooftop bar is the perfect place for pre-dinner & After-dinner drinks and serves some very fine cocktails and food if you fancy a nibble. Again, the staff here made the experience all the more special xThe spa too is a must visit and treat yourself to some relax-time.Overall, I was really impressed with this new luxury hotel and I hope to visit again soon and would highly recommend this hotel to anyone. I would also say a special word to the management…Your staff are amazing. It is a fine balance to have friendly yet professional staff but from the moment I entered your hotel I felt a genuine warm welcome and made many friends during my stay, they deserve a special mention xxx","May 24, 2019","8    Bangkok Marriott Hotel The Surawongse

Maybe the best bed and linens I have ever slept in. We had a corner room which offered amazing views of the city and hotel pool.The infinity pool on the roof is stunning and intoxicating. The service is 10/10 with great food and drinks. The pool can get a bit crowded, not surprising given how amazing it is, but wish they could add some more lounge chairs.To top it off is one of the most breathtaking rooftop bars I have ever been too. Perfect 360 degree views, we had the best time watching the sunset from the top of Bangkok.This hotel is beyond exceptional and I would highly highly recommend staying here.

482,"This is my second visit to this venue, and I didn't think it was possible to top my first (very short) stay last year. I came back to stay a little longer this time, and I was blown away again by the friendly staff and the beauty of the roof top, the elegant room (suite) and the quality of the food. Lets start by the arrival, upon arriving we were greeted by a team of ""greeters"" that make sure you are welcomed even before you enter the lobby- their smile shows happiness and appreciation that you are staying at this hotel, and you see the smiles and greetings every time you enter and leave the property- We were greeted by Tum and Jay every single time. Their uniform are beautiful and impeccably pressed. It doesn't matter how hot and humid is outside, they ALWAYS look perfect. Them they assist you get to the check-in were the friendly staff greets you and make sure your questions and needs are answered before you even ask any questions. We were upgraded to a suite- the room was so beautifully decorated with gray tones accentuated with elegantly placed pop of colors decorations - the initial reaction when I walked into the room was just beautiful and spacious - see pictures. The view form the shower was an unexpected waooo factor - so beautifully done. The bed was very comfortable as well. As Platinum member, I get access to the lounge - great drinks and cocktails in the evenings- served by a friendly staff members that cater to your needs - Mr. Mai and Etha were superv at making us feel so welcomed, but in all fairness, the entire staff members will do just that. I had the change to meet and chat with Mr. Endre (one of the managers) and I can see why the entire staff is so great, he is great at what he does, and if the staff is a reflection of management, he does an outstanding job recruiting and maintaining such an incredible team. with our brief conversation, I can tell he has a lot to experience in hospitality - such a professional gentleman. Dont miss out the roof top bar for sunset, the drinks are awesome, but the view is amazing and and pictures turn out incredible - the staff of the roof top bar will ask you to take your picture- please let them, they do a wonderful job- I can tell that they do it so often that they know what people like. this review is getting too long, so 2 more things- A must, visit the pool even if yo dont have time, go and check it out... the pictures from the infinity pool are so cool... and have breakfast at their breakfast buffet- the array of options is worth every penny. From fresh smoothies to Japanese options, noodle (soup) bar made to order, omelets, etc etc.. everyday you can discover new food options to indulge... I will definitely stay on this hotel every time I come to Bangkok. Thank you so much to the staff for making my trip so special !","May 21, 2019","8    Bangkok Marriott Hotel The Surawongse

483,"This is a beautiful hotel and we loved our stay here from May 3-5. Location wise it's not in a happening part of town, but you can walk 15 minutes to the nearest BTS station and they offer a free shuttle service in the hotel too. We had a couple of thoughts while staying there that the hotel should take on-board, especially as it's relatively new:- As you walk from the lifts and through the lobby out onto the street there's really no need for the multitude of hello's/greetings from the staff. It does get annoying after a while. There's probably not a need for so many staff just standing around.- The perfume smell as you walk into the lobby is seriously over-powering and could do with being toned down x10- The guy in charge of the pool/handing out the towels should get a raise. He knows exactly who's in which lounger and the instant one becomes available.Great service.","May 19, 2019","8    Bangkok Marriott Hotel The Surawongse

The staff are gracious, attentive, respectful and friendly and they anticipate your needs.My room was spacious and beautifully appointed with a seating area and gorgeous large bathroom with bathtub, and waterfall shower. The decor was Thai inspired and thoughtful.The rooftop swimming pool was outstanding. The infinity pool was beautiful and had a view overlooking the city. There were beautiful cabanas and chaise loungers with plenty of towels. I used to go up early (7AM) and enjoyed the peace and beauty of the place almost all to myself before starting my day. It tends to get busier after breakfast.The breakfast buffet included a vast selection of Western, Thai, Chinese and Indian options. The fresh fruit juice bar was incredible. The staff at the Praya's Kitchen where breakfast and dinner were served were gracious and attentive (this is a common theme at this hotel, so you may hear me repeat it). I want to give a special shout out to Chonticha, the assistant manager during the breakfast service. On my last day, as I was heading to my next destination, she asked the kitchen to make me a fresh squeezed passion fruit and orange juice to go for my journey. Also Pay, the manager of the dinner service always made sure that I was comfortable and well taken care of.Golf from the concierge team was my friend and advisor during my stay. He made sure that I got the information I needed, but also gave me advice and helped me to make sure that I got a taxi (or more often a Grab driver) and that they knew where to take me. He really made me feel like I had a friend and as a solo traveler, I really appreciated that.All in all, this is probably the best hotel I have ever stayed at, in terms of the beauty of the hotel, the warm and welcoming staff and the overall quality.

489,"4.5 out of 5.Stay here twice (June, 2018 and March, 2019) for a total of 9 nights.Relatively new, medium sized Marriott.Hotel has several positive attributes but IMO the best is the friendly, helpful staff in every department, like bell/door men, front desk receptionists and executive lounge staff. Staff always greet you with a smile and a willingness to see how they can make your stay better.Special kudos to staff I remembered and noted: Ruk, Golf and Tatum as bell/door men and Maitha.., (guy sp?) Surassada and Dao at the lounge.Executive lounge and rooftop bar have an amazing view.I mentioned I left my hat at a nearby Starbucks and one of the bell/door men offered to call and look for my hat and contact me if they find it. I was able to retrieve it myself the next morning but the gesture and willingness to help was very nice.I can't say enough about the staff. It wasn't just 1 or 2 who were very pleasant, it was all of them. I have traveled a fair bit and stayed in many hotels, and the staff at Bangkok Marriott Hotel The Surawongse is likely the best I have encountered.Only minor negative is the area as it is not a ""real happening"" live area. Not too many interesting places within walking distance. However, the hotel does offer a shuttle ride to a few places during the day. Bell men are also great at hailing a taxi or calling grab for you.","May 3, 2019","8    Bangkok Marriott Hotel The Surawongse

503,"My partner and I just completed an enjoyable trip through Thailand and wanted to share with you our impression of the Bangkok Marriott Surawongse.  The research I did indicated that this was one of the newer Marriott properties and the hotel seemed to be well regarded by past guests.  As this was a special trip, I requested and was (quite promptly) granted an upgrade to a corner 1 bedroom M Suite 4 days prior to our arrival.Our arrival to the Marriott Surawongse was a good indicator as to how our stay would be with the hotel.  The welcome was warm and up to the highest Thai standards, from the valet right through to the check-in and bellhop providing us with access to our suite. I can not sing the praises of the Marriott Surawongse staff enough on this matter, throughout our stay we were constantly doted upon and asked if there was anything they could do for us. I especially wanted to signal out the staff in the M Club lounge on the 31st floor. The M Club Lounge is one of the best Marriott executive lounges I have had the pleasure to utilize during my travels.  It is substantial in size, with very comfortable decor, layout and impressive views of all of Bangkok.  The M Club staff were stellar and deserve the highest of praise in how they cared for everyone visiting the lounge. As for the review of the hotel itself, it is tucked away in a residential area which provides for some peace from the hustle and bustle of many of the other hotels we have stayed at in Bangkok.  As the hotel is a little far from the nearest mass transit location for some, the hotel does provide a shuttle service to the nearest BTS station (Sala Daeng in Silom).  The shuttle service runs on a posted schedule, and is only one way, but the staff will give you a lift back should you be at the drop off point when they are dropping off other guests.  Surawong Road is a short walk to Silom Road and we did find it an easy walk to or from the BTS stations when required.  Normally the walks were in the evening, as we found the walk a little too warm during the heat of the day.  We found it a better solution to grab a metered taxi from wherever we were If we wanted to avoid the heat.  Be sure to ask the hotel staff for a return taxi card prior to stepping out for the day.  As the hotel is quite new, we found that some taxi drivers are not familiar with their location.  The cards provide the location of the hotel in Thai for ease of reference when requesting a trip back. The Concierge staff will also fill out he taxi card for you when requesting a taxi and speak to the driver on your behalf to ensure you get to where you want to go on your own.During our stay, we made sure to take advantage of as much of the amentities as possible.  Primarily we found ourselves on the hotel’s 18th floor which contains the gym, spa and outdoor pool. The gym is well appointed and will provide you with everything you need to get your workout in.  You can follow up all your workouts with a visit across the elevator lobby to the hotel’s roof top infinity pool.  The pool deck has plenty of comfortable deck loungers to relax on, with a nice ratio of shaded or in the sun loungers for everyone.  I also liked the fact that the staff at the pool were attentive to your needs, once they’d ensure you were settled in, they allowed you to drive the level of care.  If you wanted to just sit back and read a book while enjoying the deck, you were permitted that pleasure without being bothered.  When you were ready for a bite to eat or a refreshing drink, a simple wave had the staff providing you with the care you required.  We found ourselves using the pool deck often during the heat of the day as it reached “feels like” 40 degrees Celsius frequently during our stay.  I could not think of a better way to wait out the heat then grabbing a book and relaxing poolside with that amazing view.  The view at the pool is of the Sukhumvit area and include views of the impressive Ritz-Carlton Residence within the King Power MahaNakhon Building. We never got a chance to check out the Spa on this floor but I am sure it will equal the rest of the hotel’s amentities.  The other amenities we found ourselves visiting most were the M Club Lounge on the 31st floor, which I have already covered, and the Yao Restaurant on the 32nd floor of the hotel.  We hosted a Bangkok friend at the Yao Restaurant on our first night in and found the food to be top notch and the night time view of Bangkok to be equally impressive.Overall, we would highly recommend the Marriott Surawongse while in Bangkok. The only regret we had was that we missed out on their 1 year anniversary celebrations held the day after we departed.  We would have loved to have been there to congratulate them and wish them them success in the years to come.  We are looking forward to our next visit to the Marriott Surawongse.","April 11, 2019","8    Bangkok Marriott Hotel The Surawongse

504,"We stayed at this hotel for 2 nights as part of our honeymoon. It is a really new property (1 year old) and it showed - everything was so clean, modern, and the lobby impeccably furnished. I have Titanium Elite status with Marriott and we were upgraded to the 2-bedroom suite on the 24th floor. The room was huge with a nice sized kitchen and dining area, living space, and a bedroom on opposite sides of the room. Again the room was tastefully decorated and not overdone like some other hotels. We took advantage of the M Lounge which was quite large and had beautiful views of Bangkok from every side of the lounge. We ate breakfast there and also went down during the happy hour - we were impressed by the spread and taste of the food both times of the day - it was all delicious! Now let's talk about the pool. It is stunning. Although it is a pretty small pool and lounging area (poolside), you can't beat the view. I can't recall what floor it's on, but it is high up there. It had 180-degree views of Bangkok from the pool, and while it got crowded in the afternoons, we were always able to find chairs or a lounge bed. We spent quite a bit of time in the pool and just relaxing poolside - truly lovely.I'll mention one negative, though it's a minor one. Ahead of our stay at the hotel, we had called and told them it was our honeymoon. And interestingly, two days before our stay, the hotel emailed us specifically asking whether we were staying there for a special occasion to which I replied and again told them it was our honeymoon. When we arrived and throughout our stay, there was no mention of the honeymoon and we didn't receive anything, not even a note acknowledging it! I think someone just dropped the ball and didn't notate it in the system. Because the hotel had proactively reached out to us asking about a special occasion, we were kind of expecting something and when it never came, we were left a bit disappointed. And given the fact that I am a Titanium Elite member, I would have thought they would go a bit above and beyond to recognize and acknowledge my status, but we didn't see or feel that in any way. All in all, it's a beautiful hotel and I would recommend it if you're in Bangkok.","April 8, 2019","8    Bangkok Marriott Hotel The Surawongse

It was a real treat to be able to use the pool area on the 18th floor before supper. It’s an infinity pool overlooking the city‘s mix of steel and glass and more traditional buildings. Great to see the sunset from there too and watch the city transform in the changing light. The bartenders and pool staff were very attentive and helpful. Our room was elegant and stylish and supremely comfortable with all the amenities you could want. Lovely lounging area with four seat sofa and plenty of surfaces. Especially noted were the sockets, they all accepted every plug you could throw at them - great user experience! Our bathroom was gorgeous and featured a bath, walk-in in shower with seat and a large basin. Looked fabulous and was very functional. Breakfast features most everything you could ever want. All very friendly and so much variety and really great value. Our stay was short but we will certainly be back again if back in Bangkok. ","April 7, 2019","8    Bangkok Marriott Hotel The Surawongse

514,"We stayed at innspire during our first nights in Bangkok. Innspire is located near the city centre, but nevertheless quiet and peaceful as there is no traffic in this specific area. The room was tidy, the bed comfortable, and the bathroom nice and clean. Bop, the host and manager of Innspire, already made the stay worthwile. His english is good and he is very friendly, honest, and open. He was clearly focused on us as guests, thereby serving us in any way that contributed to a pleasant stay and wonderful overall experience in Bangkok. When we went for an early bicycle tour (thereby not being able to attend breakfast), Bop made extra fresh banana muffins and put them in the fridge so that we could have our own breakfast. When hungry at lunchtime, Bop took us to one of his favorite streetfood-stands where we had delicious deep fried chicken with sticky rice. We loved our stay at Innspire, with its tidy and comfortable rooms, peaceful and quiet garden where breakfast is served, and a very friendly host. When paying Bangkok a second visit, we’ll definitely come back to Innspire and we recommend everyone to stay here.Jessy and Luc from Amsterdam","July 14, 2018","9    Innspire Bangkok

518,"Small and simplistic. Charmingly unpretentious, but a clean and fresh place to stay. Extremely economical place where everything is still reasonably new, (overhead linear rain shower and small toilet in same room) with outside sink in the room with the bed. If not for the en suite bathroom, this would be more a bed and breakfast, than hotel, as it was a residential home in the past. Be prepared for stairs with your luggage, as the hotel does not have an elevator.The bedding is good (although the mattress was a bit stiff for my taste). Cute little towel arrangements in every room, working A.C., hot water, good flooring (not carpet), and balconies in some rooms - (mosquitoes are still a nuisance, however, as you are in the middle of a residential area of Bangkok). Very eager to please staff, and a small living room/lounge feel to the lobby. A small refreshment station is available at all times, with a continental made to order egg breakfast in the morning to be enjoyed on the patio. Lovingly decorated exterior, where everyone- including you- takes their shoes off before entering the building. (That's how homey this place is.)It is a difficult place to locate, however, as it is tucked away at the end of a walkable only alley. Your first time visiting will be challenging for you and the taxi driver (who will have to drop you at the beginning of the alley). We were greeted by the Bob, the Manager, upon our arrival (10:00 pm) at the beginning of the alley, to assist in luggage carrying, and leading the way to the hotel. (Again, that's how homey this place is - plus having excellent service). If you want the true feel for Bangkok, this is great start, as the arrival alley is not sanitized for tourist. This is a real Bangkok neighborhood. The area surrounding the alley is very good for tourism however, as many of the major sites, i.e. Grand Palace, are very close by. If a great price, a clean room with great service and a good location are requirements for your trip to Bangkok, this is a great economical choice.","January 30, 2018","9    Innspire Bangkok

It was a Best Western Premier once, but no more. That’s probably why it has a four star rating on some booking sites. Now, at best, it’s a two star property and quickly going for one star status.Location isn’t great either. It’s halfway between two BTS stations which means about a 10-15 minute walk and several large intersections to cross. And it’s now the rainy season in Thailand. It’s basically under a large overpass and right next to Sukhumvit road so all you hear is tuk-tuks and motorcycles all day and night.I can’t begin to describe how disgusting the fabric chair was in our room (see picture).

The room also had a big screen TV with plenty of channels to suit most visitors (English, Thai, Chinese etc) although there was a problem with the screen in our room. It looks like it was used as an advertising display screen at some point because there was a ghost image visible at all times. I didn’t complain as most of the time you hardly saw it. The hotel looks relatively new compared to other buildings around it and has a free tuk tuk to take you to On Nut BTS station which saves a 10 or 15 minute walk.

582,"I have stayed in this hotel several times during the last year - as a frequent visitor to Bangkok. Although tucked away under the Sukhumvit and Bang Na expressway flyovers it does not suffer unduly from traffic noise and although the decor is a little tired like many budget hotels in Bangkok it looks smart, is always clean, with genuinely welcoming and friendly staff several of whom speak English. It is also a short complimentary tuk tuk ride away from the On Nut Skytrain station. Cheap but cheerful - I like and can recommend it. It does not provide breakfast or food - but there are several restaurants nearby, as are the huge Tesco and Big C shopping complexes with a large selection of shops and restaurants barely 5 minutes walk away. I did not have a car on this trip but there are 3 or 4 car parking spaces in front of the hotel, at least one of which is normally vacant for residents.","April 7, 2018","10    Klassique Sukhumvit

However next to the Hotel are stationed many mini wans and cheap mini busses that can bring you to different locations in Bkk.Hotel is just Ok. Cheap price for night or two or longer stay for expatriates. No restaurant or Bar in the Hotel, but you can buy some drink and snacks on machine with coins next to the reception. Room’s are nice, bathroom bit small and in some rooms airco works not so good. However receptionist will quickly solve the problem with changing you’r room or giving you a aditional key card. (They will explain). Tv has plenty of international channels and wi-if is working good (free). Reception staff are extremely helpful and pleasant. However I was asked to pay deposit for key card,but after I ask them to show me where on the Booking.com website this requirement is mentioned they have give up. Next to the Hotel you will find a few very cheap massage shops, and across the road bit further there are few big thai restaurants with cheap Thai food.

If management take the time to look over each room carefully and sort out the small issues like dodgy air cons and tvs i think they can pull this hotel back up to where it probably started life as a nice clean, chic hotel.","January 22, 2018","10    Klassique Sukhumvit

596,"The best thing about the hotel was that it was kind of close to the skytrain, that made everything in our stay much easier. The downside it that it's really under a bridge, as weird as it might sound. The traffic keeps ju up and the view is not that nice and the outdoor area don't get that cozy from it. Also note that there is no breakfast included and it's kind of far to get one. They also provide a free shuttle tuk tuk to the skytrain station but we never got the question so I don't really know what to do to get one, we didn't ask either because we like to walk. The staff was both bad and good. We had serious problems with the AC that first of all was blowing cold air straight on the bed, and we didn't have the right remote to it. We stayed in room 310 and got the remote for 306 and without it you couldn't do anything with the AC. When we went down and talked to a man in the reception he took the remote and said he couldn't do anything. We said that it's a storm in there with 16 degrees but he just kept saying he couldn't do anything and we had to sleep in either a really hot room or a really cold one. The next day the women worked named Jingky and she fixed the problem right away and the rest of the stay was much better. So we always waited until she worked so we could ask her because the other ones didn't do anything or didn't understand. No one was rude but they didn't do anything if you asked. So a special thanks to Jingky! She also helped us do things more budget friendly. For example we wanted to go to IKEA and asked for a taxi, instead she advised to take the skytrain and the shuttle bus that we didn't know existed.","December 20, 2017","10    Klassique Sukhumvit

There is plenty to do in the area, but not insaneouly touristy. It’s also next to the BTS, which makes traveling from there very easy. The Yard itself is the coolest place ever. The rooms are very comfortabel and the decorations are fun and cute. They have a huge yard that’s designed to chill out in and you meet a lot of people hanging out there and having a drink. The staff is amazing. They are so nice and welcoming, they make you feel right at home. You can really tell they enjoy working there and it’s fun to interact with them. The owners Som & Som are the nicest and coolest people you’ll ever meet! They really put their heart into the place and make you feel part of their family.

I stayed in Private Double Bed room. The bed is very soft and clean as well as the toilet. However, the bed is on level two of the room and I have to climb up to it but the stair is quite steep that I might fall down if not careful.The Yard also encourages us to go green. They don’t use any plastic in the hostel but they provide reusable water bottle for guest and we can take it anywhere while we stay there. Also, they provide a rental bicycle so you can take it and do your own sightseeing around the area.But above everything, the staff is really nice and helpful.

631,"My husband and I used The Yard as our home base whilst we travelled around South East Asia for 6 weeks and we can not recommend it highly enough. It is an absolute gem in Bangkok - different from many other hostels in its whole approach and we loved it. The Ari neighbourhood seems fairly affluent, quiet and safe and popular with Thais and expats alike. There are tons of great restaurants in the area and even a coffee shop and hipster burger restaurant attached to the hostel to make things even easier! We loved Laliart for breakfast and amazing coffee, Paper Butter Burger for burgers obvs and Hiso Sushi. We also found two 7/11’s close by as well as a local pharmacy and a Boots pharmacy in the shopping mall across the road. It’s super easy to get around by Skytrain which we often did to beat the gridlocked Bangkok traffic! The Yard also sent us a helpful email with the address in Thai to show our taxi driver at the airport. The hostel is tucked away down a peaceful residential street so it is not a party hostel - this suited us perfectly. You still have the option to meet loads of interesting people in The Yard garden area and there is a bar in the evening - one night we arrived back at the Yard to find a pop up night market and mini concert! We did not find it very noisy at all - music and chatting from the bar always wound down before midnight. However, we could hear a particularly noisy bird and one night a guest did insist on pushing/throwing their (obviously too heavy) suitcase down the three flights of metal stairs at 3 am which undoubtedly woke everybody in hostel up and was extremely rude. There are no lifts so make sure you can carry your bag!!! We stayed approximately 8 nights in total at The Yard over our 6 weeks as we came and went to different places and stayed in private rooms both times. On arrival we were upgraded to a private room with en suite bathroom which was amazing and very much appreciated after our long flight from London! There are some very steep steps to get up to the loft beds in the private en suite rooms which is something to bear in mind. The private room with shared bathrooms are also great, although the bathrooms do seem to attract mosquitoes and I did get bitten a few times whilst using the bathroom! I loved the fact that you could leave behind any unwanted toiletries to reduce waste and the whole community/environmentally friendly vibe! The Yard also stored our suitcase for us for 6 weeks which was amazing and they have a washing machine and tumble dryer to wash and dry clothes. There is also a small kitchenette where you can top up drinking water and make small meals like pot noodle etc. The staff were so friendly and chilled out, we really loved our time at The Yard and would recommend it to anyone travelling to Bangkok. Do not hesitate to book! ❤️","March 10, 2019","11    The Yard Hostel

633,"The hostel is in the nice residential neighborhood of Ari where many expats live, it is about 5 to 10 minutes walk from a BTS station so very convenient for visits and there is a direct bus which takes you 5 minutes walk from Khao San Road. The area is packed with cafes, street food and all budget restaurants from the very simple thaï local one to more fancy places and all kinds of cuisine, thaï but also japanese and western.I booked direct by email and received a fast answer, and a few days before my arrival I got a mail to tell me how to get there should I arrive by plane, train or bus which I found was very nice.I stayed in a private room with bathroom which was very large, superclean, with aircon and hot water bathroom, and a good breakfast was included, coffee or tea, toast with butter and jam and cornflakes with yoghurt and fresh fruit. There is a common room with aircon and a tv, a garden with seats hammocks and matresses on the grass (with fan!!!).Check in and check out were very fast and easy, the staff is an excellent source of information, this place was a gem I found in Bangkok and I shall most likely come back!","February 25, 2019","11    The Yard Hostel

The owners big Som + little Som are really kind, fun, happy people who are a delight to be around. The eco sustaining aspects were really appealing to me and the free yoga on a Friday was a nice touch. There are many activities to keep you entertained and it’s easy to make friends with the open garden chill out area and bar. There’s even a inside lounge area with a sofa and pillows where you can watch movies and play computer games. It is only a 5 minute walk to ‘Ari’ metro station, there are many buses within a few minutes walking distance also, and you can get to Bangkok’s famous Chatuchak weekend market in 10 minutes on the local bus. There is a great mix of super cheap local food stalls and more hipster coffee shops, cool restaurant and eateries from many different cuisines and countries. I’ve travelled a lot but honestly, The Yard is the best hostel I’ve ever stayed in! It’s super clean, they play great music, you can order food at the bar, the cocktails are delicious.

659,"Pretty picky with hostels so here's the bad to start with: room can get noisy (@ 6 bed dorm), didn't like the fact that they don't provide guests with towels (you have to pay 40baht every time when you already pay ~500bht per night) and some dorm rooms might smell funny.Overall, the garden is fantastic - an oasis from the city, people working there will make that extra mile for you, perfect vibes and it's a generally clean and comfortable place to be.","September 23, 2018","11    The Yard Hostel

688,"I stayed there for 7 nights during the week of June16th. Sure, rooms are large, though their decoration is a little “oldish”, the location is excellent and the fitness facility is great, but I expect this from a 5* hotel. What I do not expect is poor service in the reception desk (on the contrary, the concierge was excellent) and housekeeping. I asked for a latex pillow at 2pm, they totally forgot it and brought it to my room at 7pm after my 2nd call. I left my shoes out for shining, they woke me up the next morning (!!) to actually tell me the shoes are ready and someone will be bringing them up to my room... These are unacceptable mistakes for a high quality establishment.Worse, my check-out took almost half an hour (!) as they could not understand how to input my company’s address and Tax ID (necessary for the official invoice). Finally, until today my Marriott Bonvoy account is only credited with one instead of seven nights (probably due to a mistake from the front desk) so I must now make special requests online.A large room and a nice breakfast are standard requirements for a 5* hotel; what makes the difference are the “little touches”.

725,"I was really disappointed with my experience at this hotel.I booked through Agoda and the listing had the twin room listed as ""window without view"" and 2 pictures of a twin room with a window high up so there was no view out, but natural daylight light coming in.On arrival they gave me a room with no window at all. The room smelt a bit mouldy and within a couple of hours it had aggravated my sinuses so I couldn't breathe through my nose.I told the staff and they were dismissive and didn't want to help.They could only offer me an upgrade if I paid.I had no choice but to pay since I needed sleep. I had a flight at 6:30am the next morning and didn't want my health to suffer any further. Looking from scratch for a new hotel when I had flown in internationally that morning was not really an option.They offered no apology, no discount, etc.So as though it isn't bad enough to sell a room not as described they then used the opportunity to up-sell.NOT IMPRESSED.Oh I nearly forgot, they offered to spray the first room with air freshener as though that would get rid of the mould......anyone with allergies knows that would have only doubled the problem by adding additional allergens to the air.Even if you don't have mould allergy, it is highly hazardous to health and so I would recommend avoiding. I hope the staff response I have detailed tells you everything you need to know about this hotel.In addition other guests were noisy and so sleep was virtually impossible. Despite having twin rooms, the ""hotel"" has a hostel feel and other guests lacked consideration. Next door there were around 4 guests in the room and they were talking loudly at 1:30am with the door wide open.The only thing I liked about this hotel was its location near City Storage and that they allowed a slightly early check in.","January 14, 2019","13    Metro Pratunam Boutique Hotel

You can walk along the street via Palladium World Shopping Mall, walk straight down pass the Berkeley Hotel, NEON night market, & two conveniences store 7-11 till you see the road sign “Soi 35”, turn in on your left side, about 200 m you can find the yellow hotel signboard. The Hotel is easily accessible by taxi, but BTS station is a little far away.  Hotel have well minimalist interior, clean & tidy. They offer lots of different kind of room for different kind of travelers ranging from individual or for a group of family/friends. Free Wifi is provided in room & public area, the connection was good & fast. The Hotel is nearby the Shopping Malls: Platinum Fashion Mall, Big C, Palladium World Shopping Mall, Siam Paragon, Siam Square, Siam Discovery, Siam Centre, Central World. The popular restaurant Go Ang Pratunam Chicken Rice Restaurant also only 10 min from the hotel, across the Berkeley Hotel.5 of us got ourselves in a room for 6 with shared shower room & toilet. The room is equipped by 2 queen beds, 2 bunk beds & 6 single cupboards. The shower rooms & toilets was separated for women & men. Since We’re all women so we just experience with women’s toilet. It was cleaned every day. Shampoo & body wash is available in the shower room. However, you have to bring your own for other toiletries, or you can buy at nearby conveniences store 7-11. Towel were provided in the room & would be changed after 3 night’s stay, before 3 night’s stay it would be charged 50 Bath/towel.The hotel is very strict with rule that any stain found on the towel, it would be charged 350 Bath/ towel and you can get the stained towel if you want.The only down point, is the wash room was that the toilet seems to be flooded with water always as the water does not seems to flow towards the drain. The room is not soundproof. We can literally hear what the next-door travelers were talking about.  The meal is excluded in our package; the hotel provides us with 100 bath breakfast at lobby level restaurant with limited choices of main menu– western, porridge or chicken rice, bread & instant Mie in cup as additional menus. Most of the staff is Philippines, they were nice and polite, and could converse well in English. They greeted us with smile every day & happy to help you. The staff were assured us that the room will be reserved for us no matter how late we arrived.  Overall, we enjoyed our stay in the hotel and would definitely come back!

The room is clean and was told by the front desk, they will clean my room on the 3rd day of my stay, which they did. I may have made a mistake looking at the room with attached bathroom, as the room I booked did not have attached bathroom but shared ones. So families with younger kids may not like this arrangement. The breakfast was not included, so you need to check when booking, as it cost 100baht per person per day. In terms of shopping, you have a couple of choices like Pratunam Market, Neon or even a little further to Indra area. Personally, I found Indra had far better bargains.

The breakfast is excellent, with the best coffee I have ever had. The rooms are another concern. They are good size and the AC works well. There is not daily housekeeping, unless you ask for it. Their website does not tell you it is not a full service hotel, but only as they say, ""selective service"" ( I have not seen that term since the 1960's when it referred to the military draft). When asked to service the room, they did a very good job., I find it very strange that a Hyatt property would not offer daily housekeeping without requesting it, a real come down for Hyatt. The rooms have the best number of plugs and usb charing outlets I have ever seen. The rooms are dark, very few lamps. The bathroom is sleek and modern, but also dark. I found it difficult to even shave in it, and I cannot imagine the problem for one trying to put on make up. The tv is against a wall on which there are no chairs to sit on across from and watch, You either sit on the bed or the sofa and turn and cran your neck to watch tv. Very uncomfortable. Incredible that there are no drawers in the room, you pile all your folded clothes on the desk.The service and location of the hotel are wonderful. The design of the room is very bad. The lack of full service is certainly not what I expect from a Hyatt.

After a lot of discussion, we were given bigger rooms. Room size was adequate but not well lighted, and the room feels dingy even if all lights are switched on. You have to have curtains drawn all the time as the next building is very close. Bathroom size is a bit cramped. The hotel doesn't have a kitchen. They do serve breakfast on the third floor which is quite reasonable but if you need food at other time of the day, there are very limited choices and they levy 10% service charge on that and one has to go to the lobby to eat that food .

792,"It was a very good overnight stay at the Hyatt Place Sukhumvit. If you're wondering why it's not a five-star review, it's simply because it lacked the wow factor--character, quirkiness, call it whatever you want--that can make this a five-star review. The hotel is pretty standard for a Hyatt Place (the style is similar to some of the newly renovated Hyatt Place hotels wherever with an option for sofa bed and such).Staff are friendly without being over fussy, although the staff that greeted us during breakfast seemed more intent of talking to each other than welcoming guests and getting their room numbers, but it's a minor thing.Check-in was fast and efficient and the staff there were welcoming.Rooms were standard for a category 1 Hyatt Place property. There's a small pool at the upper floor. Everything looked efficient and proper, like a well-oiled machine that knows what it's doing already. Breakfast was limited, but alright at this price range. Perhaps a level higher than the continental breakfast one gets at American hotels.Overall, I'd stay here again if I need an overnight stay in Bangkok before I fly domestic to some other places in Thailand. They know what they're doing and they're efficient in doing it.Location is a bit off from the train station--you will pass by Hilton and DoubleTree Sukhumvit before reaching the hotel and the sidewalk is narrow and often crowded so best not to carry huge luggage walking to the hotel.Tip: Wherever in Southeast Asia, download the Grab App. It's the Uber of Southeast Asia and cheaper than taxi.","May 8, 2019","14    Hyatt Place Bangkok Sukhumvit

The staff were friendly especially Joey who helped us checking -in the hotel and talked us through what are the best places to go ehile we're in Bangkok. The bell boys were also very helpful, making sure thatbour taxi drivers know where we will go. Breakfast buffet was good, with a wide variety of food to choose from. The dimsums were superb! Chef was really friendly too and polite If only I have more than two hands then I can give HYATT PLACE more than TWO THUMBS UP!","May 3, 2019","14    Hyatt Place Bangkok Sukhumvit

Bathroom shower clean and modern. Shower was a good size. Breakfast was great. Full selection of everything!Small pool upstairs was great for a refreshing dip at the end of a hot day. End of the street was the BTS, ( sky rail), very convenient and a great way to get around Bangkok. Outside hotel was a 7/11 and pharmacy which is really convenient. You are pretty much close to everything. Bar upstairs was also handy on a couple of occasions. Only negative I would say was that the room is a little dark- needed more light especially for me that needs glasses to read everything- but I would not mark it down because of this- too many positives and our experience here was flawless.","April 24, 2019","14    Hyatt Place Bangkok Sukhumvit

It was a good room size. I felt the basic amenities are there in the bathroom. Tooth brush, shampoo, conditioner, body soap, hair drier. Kettle, coffee and teas also available.Good shower. I felt the point was the breakfast, food selection is good, they have someone to offer omelettes prepared on spot, Thai selection, bread, fruits and cold cuts, cheese in the fridge (other hotels would leave in the environment). Coffee machine. To me, the only remark is that the salad and cereals corner had some fruit flies around. This happened on both days I stayed.

When you will go there you have to drop at BTS Prompong station and go to with the signage (2nd exit door maybe).

802,"Stayed for 5 nights, easy connection from the BTS station but beware the pavements along the road as they are tight and uneven. Getting a taxi can be tricky as the traffic is very bad around the area. Clean modern hotel, easy and fuss free check-in but not keen on the high/low floors lift design as high floor rooms will need to change lift to access those floors. King standard room very big with modern touches, saw few reviews complained about the dim lighting in the room, I thought it was acceptable but if you had to use a laptop for work, you may find it challenging. Bathroom well layed out, and great water pressure for the walk in showers. One hate is the plug sockets, you can only use one at a time as the sockets are too close to each other (UK plugs, see photo)Breakfast good with Western/Asian selections, like the live egg and noodle station and layout of the restaurant.Didn't use the gym/pool but looks fine to me.

False advertising. The Hyatt Place is beautiful, clean, modern, wonderful roof top lounge and evening food in the Aire Bar lounge on the 28th floor. The Hyatt""s hostess Meow does an excellent job there keeping guests happy with superior service. Always happy and smiling. I look forward to seeing her there during my next stay.Check-in at the Lobby is always a breeze. Puan checked me in this time. She is always very efficient and pleasant to see her smiling face each time I am there. All of the front desk staff are professionals and do an outstanding job. The staff always has a nice room waiting for me. It takes them maybe no more than 5 minutes to check me in and for me to be on the elevator to my room. My vista room is great and has a wide view of Bangkok. Wonderful king bed as well as work desk and refrigerator. Also this HP is a short 5 min walk to a shopping center with supermarket and food court. Also the BTS Skytrain is right there as well. Plenty of restaurants around the area. Great location. You cannot compare this to any Hyatt Place located in the USA. The breakfast buffet is excellent where as the USA HP's only offer a substandard breakfast which is not edible.

There is also a 7-11 convenience store just opposite the hotel.Despite the tall and narrow building style, the hotel has bright and modern interior spaces. Staffs were polite and friendly, room was spacious, clean and cozy with comfortable beds. However, the lights in the room were too dim to read. Breakfast is inclusive if you booked direct with the hotel. The options was limited but the quality was good, there was a corner for vegetarian too (thumbs up).We stayed here for 4 nights and the breakfast items changed every day.

Check-in was a breeze despite the fact that it was a little early. I did mobile check-in while waiting for my flight at Kolkata but never expected a breeze. So the first impression was 5/5. What else! Aire Bar on the 28th floor offers amazing view of the Bangkok skyline, again 5/5. Breakfast options and spread absolutely as expected, therefore another 5/5. Location, right in the heart of Sukhumvit on Soi 24 which offers easy access to Skytrain BTS just a little walk away as also an elaborate shopping mall called Emporium so another 5/5. Quiet sleep in a spacious room with perfect fittings with excellent view of Sukhumvit high rises through your windows, again another 5/5. I just cannot think of another hotel at such reasonable cost.

The egg station is nice but people don't want to wait to get served. Extra quantities at a rechaud wouldn't hurt.-The groom service definitely was needed and is a big plus from last year.-Extra lighting is in place so the rooms are now bright enough.-The maid although super polite and friendly could be more professional. I put the change sheets card on the bed, but only the duvet and the pillocases were changed; not the bottom sheet. Moreover, she left the hand soap in place till it was paper thin. The sink area was repetitively not cleaned well enough as she did not bother to move things a little bit in order to clean. Both last year and now, the baby-cot comes without a cover sheet or blanket. We used a bathroab instead.-The all day dining at the reception is of a very average quality.

I message Jenny Nui and she responded immediately. She was extremely helpful and was very detailed with all the information we needed. I actually ended up asking her to plan our entire trip. She created an entire package that we will forever remember and be forever GRATEFUL. Our package included Vietnam and Thailand. She took care of EVERY single detail, from airport transfers, hotels, tours all inter Asia flights. She left no detail untouched. So needless to say that she operates her hotel the same way. Attention is paid to EVERY detail. Very close to airport but easy to get to rail transport. Very big room, super clean and fresh feeling, very comfortable beds, modern bathroom. Food was delicious (must try the homemade jam) we experienced the buffet as well as the cook to order menu and both were equally GREAT. The staff was very attentive genuinely happy to have us as guests. I can’t say enough about this hotel. I rate it EXCELLENT And will recommend to anyone going to Bangkok and hope to visit again as Thailand is a paradise with so much to see and do and if you are lucky enough to have Ms Jenny Nui creates you a dream itinerary you will want to return.","April 29, 2019","15    U-Tiny Boutique Home Suvarnabhumi Bangkok

828,"AMAZING PLACE TO STAY IN CHIANG MAI!!! HIGHLY RECOMMENDMy husband and I stayed here for a week while in Chiang Mai. We can't say enough amazing things about this very quaint and CLEAN lodge. The customer service is beyond anything we could have imagined. Patcha, Seb, Bon & the rest of the staff truly made our stay so pleasant. They helped us with transportation, booking an amazing tour (DUMBO), recommended restaurants and things to do. They have coffee, water and crackers available 24/7. Seb is the friendliest and always smiling and one heck of a bartender. The rooms were beautifully decorated and very CLEAN. The bar /pool area were very relaxing. It definitely is a wonderful BOUTIQUE hotel. We would walk in the reception area and they would greet us by name. After we left ,we realized we left some stuff in the safe, we contacted Patcha and it was no problem having them sent to our hotel in Krabi registered mail. She even contacted the hotel we were staying out to let them know. We would give them 10 stars if we could! BIG THANK U!!!

835,"I chose this hotel for a relaxing stopover before a long flight. It proved ideal for this purpose, with its quiet and pleasant atmosphere. I enjoyed my short stay so much that I wished I was sorry to leave. Although its location makes it particularly suitable for a short stay before or after a flight, I would consider staying longer another time. A city centre hotel is more appropriate for visiting the sights of the city but if visiting sights outside the city, they can just as easily be reached from U-Tiny. If you like gardens and appreciate peace and quiet, you will not find as nice a place to stay in the city, certainly not at this price. As well as the ambiance, what makes U-Tiny exceptional is the attitude of its staff. They are quite charming, helpful and welcoming.My room was a good size, well equipped, modern, clean and comfortable. The restaurant offers a good choice of reasonably priced food. Everything I tried was very nice.To complete my stress-reducing stay, the airport transfers were convenient and comfortable (and also reasonably priced).If I return to Bangkok, I will certainly stay there again.

Each had negatives and so the search for a ""keeper"" had continued until we found U-Tiny Boutique Home on our most recent overnight in the BKK area. Transfer from and back to BKK worked fine (yay!), and the room was spacious and very clean with an excellent bathroom. Furnishings were a bit sparse, but not a problem. The bedding was of high quality and felt very clean (in previous stays at other hotels, I've often felt that the bedding may not have been changed between guests), and we had a very good sleep.

The owners and staff (especially Jenny) went out of their way to help us and make sure we enjoyed our stay. The hotel is very close to the airport - tucked away in a safe and private oasis - but that also means it is not within walking distance of anything. Our room rate included an airport transfer. The hotel can arrange tours and taxis if you want to explore and will give you a free ride if you’re just going a short distance. They will also pick you up for free from the nearest subway station or the airport if you prefer to use public transit to get around. Our included breakfast had a choice of eggs, bacon, sausage, toast/jam and juice/tea/coffee. If you’re checking out before breakfast they will provide dinner the night before instead and you have a choice of about 10 dishes ncluding sandwiches, noodles and other Thai dahes. They also have a more extensive menu and a fixed price meal deal if you want to purchase food and they sell beer and wine and a large selection of juices, smoothies and coffee/tea.

Super friendly staff that helped us with transportation to downtown Bangkok and even made some phone calls on our behalf. Nice breakfast next to the pool and clean rooms. I would highly recommend this place. ,"April 21, 2018","15    U-Tiny Boutique Home Suvarnabhumi Bangkok

867,"Needed an airport hotel as were flying early from BKK to Vietnam. Saw the good reviews and we were really impressed with this hotel for the price. The man at reception spoke very good English and all the staff were very friendly. Room was spacious with everything you needed for a short stay. They even have someone to cook a meal in the evening. We had pad Thai that was very tasty. Breakfast was a nice selection, juice, fresh fruit, cereal, bacon, scrambled eggs, rice and a toaster for the bread with jam. The voucher for the hotel, depending on what you paid should include 1 meal. They also have a shuttle service that runs every hour to the airport. We booked the 8am shuttle but there was a bit of confusion as the shuttle had gone to pick someone up from the airport so they kindly rang for a taxi and paid the fare for us which we thought was brilliant. Would definitely stay here again if we needed an airport hotel at BKK. ","April 11, 2018","15    U-Tiny Boutique Home Suvarnabhumi Bangkok

868,This place had the most comfortable beds out of all the places I stayed. The ambiance of the room was very nice and well decorated. I appreciated the cleanliness it was definitely up to my standards. The hotel staff was very friendly and nice. They had great food for a decent price. The free breakfast was delicious. I wish this would have been the first place I stayed when I got there and then the last place because they had free shuttle service from and to the airport. It was extremely challenging finding a place with good food until I discovered this gem outside the city. If you get a chance you must stay here.

869,"Stayed here for 1 night as our flight from Bangkok was early the next morning. To be honest it was okay but the A/C didn’t work well and we just put up with it so not the hotels fault. I had to ask 3-4 times for an iron and each time I was told yes 1 moment please. We asked for an early taxi at 05.30 and we actually got a pick up truck for 150 baht... what spoilt our night here was the attitude of the guy in the morning, he was just so rude when asking me to pay the food bill from the previous night when I already had done so! and we’re sure the driver of our pick up truck was just a mate and that in itself wasn’t an issue but he should’ve told us.Would I stay here again?

The food too was excellent,a typical Thai evening meal & a very good English breakfast. The landlady even went out of her way to organise taxis when we went into town.

871,"If you are thinking for a night stay for stop over, could consider this hotel. We tried staying here for a night because we arrived in the evening, while we didn't plan of going anywhere, thought it could save us the cost of hotel for the night if compared to hotels in town.Though it supposed to be near airport, but you can't reach there without a car. Good that the hotel provides to and from transport for Suvarnabhumi Airport. The room rates includes breakfast as well other than the airport transfer.It seems that it's run by a family or close friends for years. It is a simple, neat accommodation with what you need. The room we had was spacious, quiet and clean. The gentleman at the reception spoke very good English and very helpful. The food choices in the menu were more of western with a little local Thai dishes. The small swimming pool looked pretty at night and day, but don't think would like to swim in it. The breakfast buffet was good enough, but of course not to compare to 4/5 starts hotel. It's a cozy stay if you are not planning to go shopping or sightseeing(of course you can still do it if you want to). And the rate for the room and the perks(breakfast/airport transfer) with clean environment and friendly staff. I would recommend this for stop over stays.","April 3, 2018","15    U-Tiny Boutique Home Suvarnabhumi Bangkok

Full vegetarian menu available. Very reasonably priced food and drink. Huge beds in 'family & friends' room. We ordered an extra bed for a 5th person but didnt need it as the beds are like doubles. Great pool (and pool towels provided) and plenty of shade. Lovely free breakfast provided. Brought us (free of charge) to a pharmacy when my son had a fever.

Wang (the manager) and the staff were very attentive to my needs. The room was new, clean, and modern. Located only a few minutes from the airport, you'd think it would be noisy, but it's situated down a side street hundreds of meters from the busy roads and so is quiet. I'm a bird-watching guide in Panama and a life-long birder, and I'd assumed there would be some good birds in the garden. There were. But what was unexpected was there are many great birds in the adjacent neighborhood and marsh. I saw more than two dozen species including Pink-necked Green Pigeon, Lesser Coucal, Plaintive Cuckoo, Common Tailorbird, Oriental Magpie-Robin, Pied Fantail, Red-whiskered Bulbul, Yellow-vented Bulbul, Streak-eared Bulbul, Asian Koel, Ashy Woodswallow, Chinese Pond Heron, Yellow Bittern, Scaly-breasted Munia, White-rumped Minia, Common Iora, plus the usual common herons, mynas, doves, and sparrows.

First, you are greeted with a snack and tea as well as given a map to help introduce you to Bangkok. At night, you choose your breakfast and time you would like it. Little did I know the feast that would be waiting for me the next morning including a huge plate of the most juicy, sweet, colorful fruit I have ever laid eyes on. Followed by the sweetest green dipping sauce for a doughnut of sorts. AMAZING! All of the employees went above and beyond to make me feel at home and make it easy for me to explore their amazing city! I would recommend this place to anyone who goes to Bangkok.

887,"I think this really is the best hotel I've ever stayed in. Hotel is really nicely decorated and the staff was amazing and they spoked really good English. Staff really helped customers with every thing they needed during their stay. There was even a little present and custom made note in my room every day I came back to the hotel. I think people with some kind of problems with their balance or legs should check that they are not in rooms with two floors because the stairs were really steep! But other than that I loved my room, it was clean and comfortable.The hotel is located in the center of the old city center and every tourist attraction is near by. I think only minus side is that it's pretty far from the Siam district and all the shopping malls. You can get there by using the water buss + BTS, it's cheap but the water buss system can be a bit confusing. Luckily taxis are not that expensive so you can still get around. This hotel really works with environment friendly principles and that is always a plus for me. They had filtered water available so you don't have to drink bottled water. And you can decide when you sheets and towels are chanced. Also the breakfast is made based on pre orders so there is not so much left over food.

First off....besides being a beautiful building with very unique accommodations....the staff are all top notch. Everyone was so helpful and kind and go out of their way yo make sure you have the best time. Jason is amazing and runs this wonderful Inn. He takes pride in what he has built and it shows. From the beautifully decorated suites to the thoughtful personal gifts on your pillow to the amazing breakfasts....you couldn't ask for much more. He will help you set up personal tours and recommend things to see. Our only regret was cancelling our bike tour with the Inn as we were at the end of a month long holiday and exhaustion and heat got the best of us. We stayed in the Garden Suite with its beautiful outdoor feeling tub. The air conditioning was wonderful and we loved every breakfast we had. Definitely try the egg dish cooked in a little frying pan. The chef is amazing!! Comfortable beds and pillows and excellent housekeeping services. Stay at The Old Capital Bike Inn while in Bangkok.

891,"Our favourite hotel over our 2 week stay in Thailand. Everything was exceptional, from check-in with a delicious iced Thai tea and cold towel, through to the beautifully designed room.Initially we had a problem locking the door, however the hotel got out a locksmith and replaced immediately. In fact, the staff went above and beyond to make sure we had a great trip (organising us taxis through Grab, which was a great app and helped us throughout our trip rather than having to argue with Thailand's notorious taxi drivers who often refuse to use the meter).We stayed in a Garden suite which was just amazing. There was a freestanding bathtub in a separate 'garden' area with skylights, as well as a toilet and shower room. The room was spacious and a retreat from the heat and hustle bustle of the city. Every bit of the room had been designed with love, and it was a far more pleasant stay than the often copy/paste design of corporate hotel rooms. We particularly enjoyed the free gifts and hand-written notes we received everyday from the staff.The room ha a minibar with free water and the TV had Netflix as an option. Breakfast was a real feast. There's a list of options, from a typical Vietnamese style eggs and sausage dish, through to waffles with maple syrup. Every day we were given fresh fruit and a changing Thai dessert.The location is perfect for the Old City and the main attractions of Bangkok. Getting to the hotel from the airport isn't as easy as some (you'll need a taxi from Phaya Thai if you get the airport skytrain), however taxis are relatively cheap and take around 15mins. There's plenty of decent restaurants nearby - we particularly enjoyed Hemlock which is on the hotel's list of recommendations. Unfortunately the night we stayed they were not running the night bike tour which we would have loved to do if we could.","May 10, 2019","16    Old Capital Bike Inn

If you turn right as you leave the hotel there are a few hipster coffee shops. Keep walking straight for around 10 minutes and you’ll hit Phra Atit road, which has plenty of good restaurants- we had a very good meal at Hemlock and some great (if slightly pricey) craft beer at YOLO.If you’re adventurous you can try using the river boat to get around town- quite an experience at busy times!!","April 22, 2019","16    Old Capital Bike Inn

901,"When the constant energy of Bangkok becomes overwhelming, you need a place both tranquil and welcoming. Enter the Old Capital Bike Inn. From the first moment that we arrived, Jason and the staff ensured that our visit was perfect. True skill is shown not just in providing outstanding service, but doing it in such a way as to appear effortless. And this place does just that. Our luggage was whisked up to the room before we even realized it was gone. We had a cool drink in front of us, at the table by the window, before we realized that we needed one. The hotel speaks to a quieter time when guests arrived with steamer trunks and wicker furniture was du jour not a novelty. Although adorned with period pieces and original art work framed of iron and bike parts, it all presents as timeless and classic with no sense of trendiness or kitch. The rooms are delightful. We stayed in the honeymoon suite. The bed was super comfortable, the AC worked excellently and the room was nicely appointed. The single criticism that can be offered was the absence of any dresser in which to store one's clothes; one really had to live out of the suitcase. Breakfast each morning was a culinary delight. One placed one's breakfast order the night before. One word of caution, the serving sizes are very large so restraint when ordering multiple dishes is advisable. The hotel itself is centrally located in the old city and affords one easy access to all the main tourist attractions. It is also close to a cool jazz bar (Brown Sugar Jazz Bar) and across the street from a franchise diner 'Steves' if you're not up to more than a 100 foot walk to a restaurant. Highly recommend this hotel for stays of 2-4 nights. Staff wonderful. Rooms wonderful. Food wonderful.","March 1, 2019","16    Old Capital Bike Inn

903,"A good friend of mine from college and I decided to meet up in Thailand for a friend's vacation, with our first stop being in Bangkok. Neither of us had visited before, so we really weren't sure what area of town would be best to stay, much less what hotel. After some google searching, I stumbled upon reviews of the Old Capitol Bike Inn. I liked the look of the photos, and the place had good reviews, so we decided to give it a shot. Let me tell you, it did not disappoint! The hotel is in the perfect location to walk to various temples, restaurants, parks, the river, and some local tourist streets complete with street vendors, bars, and hotels. But, it's a far enough distance from the hustle and bustle that things are calm and quiet by the hotel. The hotel is meticulously kept, and the staff incredibly warm, friendly, and helpful. Their English was impeccable, which was helpful as we looked for recommendations of where to eat or what to see. Each room has WiFi as well as air conditioning, which was a welcomed reprieve from the heat and humidity of the city! I would definitely stay here again, and highly recommend it!","February 19, 2019","16    Old Capital Bike Inn

Our first guides name was Kenny our second guide was Chu. Kenny’s English was somewhat better than Chu’s however Chu’s passion for historical details was far superior. If I was to give one suggestion to Jason it would be that his staff needs to be trained in directions to restaurants, we had a difficult time with staff in receiving proper directions to local restaurants walking which was frustrating.","January 28, 2019","16    Old Capital Bike Inn

The staff were very nice and accommodating - we received a free welcome drink, a map, and information about a free massage at an affiliated spa (which was top notch). They do offer a free biking tour (theme of the hotel is antique bikes) which we did not do but I'm sure it was great. The breakfast was awesome. Along with the menu items we selected we also received a few local ""bonus items."" Some of the best fruit we had in Thailand and one morning we got chinese donuts with this awesome dipping sauce. It was a very comfortable retreat to have, as we needed many cool down/chill out breaks in between going out and about in Bangkok. Would definitely stay here again. Should also mention it is well situated around most of the tourist attractions, but the street itself is not overly crazy which we liked.","January 21, 2019","16    Old Capital Bike Inn

909,"OCBI was amazing. My husband and I traveled around Japan and Thailand for our honeymoon during December/January, and this place was by far our favorite accommodation. We stayed in the honeymoon suite, and it was just so nice. Lovely murals and furniture everywhere. Beautiful light fixtures. Amazing outdoor tub. We even got a free massage included! We loved it all. We were a little leery about spending time in Bangkok because of what other tourists said about it, BUT I'm so glad we did because it's an incredible city. We loved OCBI's location in Old City, so close to all of the touristy spots but also lots of sweet little boutiques and local shops and eateries. We spent hours just walking around and exploring the area. Jason offered a free bike tour of Old City on one of the evenings we were there, and it was just the best! He took us to some nice locations for photos as well as to a local street football match and served us some delicious coconut ice cream from this sweet little shop. The included breakfasts at OCBI were SO good; we looked forward to them every day. The waffle was especially delicious. Jason and Nantiya do an incredible job of personalizing everything. Jason provided so many food/activity suggestions for both Bangkok and Chiang Mai, complete with detailed maps. They also created a nice itinerary for our time in Old City with suggestions for what to do each day. And perhaps the sweetest part of our stay was coming back to our room each evening to a little note of gratitude and a small gift on our bed. It was all very touching and made our trip so memorable. We'll never forget OCBI and truly hope we can come back some day!","January 8, 2019","16    Old Capital Bike Inn

Between the friendly, English speaking staff, retro (40's!) music and quaint colonial atmosphere, we were thrilled to have such a warm place to spend out last evening. Since our flight back to the US was at 10:40 pm, we walked around Bangkok all day, but were allowed to keep out bags at the hotel and have a shower to clean up (and chill) before our flight home. They arranged an airport taxi. Couldn't have asked for more! AND, they had a few craft beers (my husband and I are beer geeks) which were far more interesting than the weak lagers we endured throughout the rest of our trip to Thailand.

We were able to walk all over the Old City from the hotel as well as over to the Royal Palace and University. There are several very cute cafes and bars just down the road and one of Bangkoks most well known restaurants is about a 15 min walk away.

We stayed in a ground floor room and would recommend you do too as our room had a sort of extra room with a bath and seating but with a glass roof you can block out with an awning. Really good bathroom, best shower in Thailand.Small reception dining area is lovely and the Thai egg breakfast is new to me but we ate it every morning as it is excellent. Everyone eats it. Plus the fruit and coffee. Don't say I didn't tell you. Not far from a klong you can get a boat to the newer side of town. Close to Khao San road. So if you rate staying in a small slightly quirky place rather than the standard hotel and can afford something better than a backpacker joint, you can't go wrong here.Loved it.

941,"I had 1 night here, i don't often choose homestay as a place to rest but as a friend suggested me to come, I made my way to try it out. It was good and comfy at all , historical lessons learned from the locals.I had a cool dream being a Thai while sleeping in their comfy bed. It was fun at all, not really superstitious but as they said the some passed Thai were trying to welcome me by hanging out with me in my dream. Believe it or not, many fun stories came up about the souls and stuffs. ","June 8, 2018","17    Loog Choob Homestay

942,"The hotel is located in a quiet not very touristy area between the Old town of Bangkok and busy Sukhumvit. Both a younger lady and an elderly gentleman who run the hotel were extremely kind and helpful with food recommendations, taxi reservations and overall very talkative! There are lots of streetfood stands nearby as well as a seven-eleven shop besides a streetfood and fruit market (strongly recommended). The rooms were very clean and lovely decorated, spacious with a generous bath and balcony. There is also a huge hangout area at the top floor with free coffee, tea, muffins, cornflakes and other breakfast stuff (with a tiny version on the other floors). Besides you are also free to wash your own clothes which fitted us perfectly due to the hot Bangkok weather.Definately a 10/10 for such a little rate and great service!","April 6, 2018","17    Loog Choob Homestay

943,"These guys have been incredible. First, my flight landed really early in the morning (2am) so I emailed them to let them know and ask for a really, really early check in. They promptly emailed me back noting that while they couldn’t accommodate an early check in due to being totally booked, they have a private room where I could rest while waiting. I wasn’t expecting much of this room but they really went above & beyond to make me comfortable. I arrived at 2am via Uber and called to be let in (the front door closes at 10pm but there is another door around the corner that guests can access all night using their keycards, which I didn’t have yet). She quickly answered my call, quickly came downstairs, and showed me to the private room. It was SO comfortable! It basically looked like a hotel room. And she showed me the lovely private bathroom and shower that I could use. The door locked from the inside in multiple locations. I’m from Manhattan & know the importance of this. This is beyond excellent customer service! The next morning, I woke up to some beautiful classical music playing in the main lobby area. As I was about to leave for the day, the host kindly put my baggage in a private locked area and gave excellent advice about avoiding scams and where I could get a delicious breakfast/coffee. And boy was she right about that breakfast! Upon returning from exploring for the day, I officially checked in & was directed to my real room. Super easy check in, truly beautiful room with modern bathroom and balcony with a zen garden feel. AND they serve breakfast in the morning - some yummy pastries and coffee :) I can’t say enough good things about this place. Traveling alone in Bangkok (as a young, white, blonde female) had me a little nervous but these guys put all of those concerns to rest. Their WiFi is fast, water is hot for showers (it does take a minute to warm up), and they provide you with helpful maps, including one in Thai that you can hand to any cab or Tuk tuk driver. They take safety very seriously - even started a website to warn tourists about scams in Bangkok. And they are close to all the touristy things, really great area. Look no further: this is where you want to book!!!","February 14, 2018","17    Loog Choob Homestay

Our room is very spacious and clean (aaannd, if you get the top level, you'll have immediate access to the rooftop too). They also provide self serve pantry and complimentary bread and other pastries for brekky.Other than that, the location of the hotel is quite close to the city centre, so transport fees are not that much.

969,"We loved our time at Loog Choob and would have no hesitation booking again when we next visit Bangkok. Everything about our experience was super smooth from start to finish and really got our holiday off to a great start. The building is beautifully designed and being on a quiet street, provides a calm oasis away from the hustle and bustle of Bangkok's busy downtown area, though nothing is too far away. Khao San - 25 minute walk. Chao Phraya river - 25 minutes in the opposite direction & plenty of tuk-tuks & taxis around if you're feeling the heat. From the moment you step through the lovingly renovated lobby of this shophouse conversion it's clear that someone has a real eye for colour and design. The use of glass is masterly giving the whole place a light and airy feeling, making Loog Choob far more than your average home stay. This is boutique luxury and at a great price too. We had a wonderful, chic room with a comfortable bed, a great bathroom and a sitting area where we could relax and watch the world go by outside. Everything was spotlessly clean too. The family who own and run the place are delightful and gave us lots of advice on what to see and where to eat, always important to a couple of foodie Brits. Do give the street food a try. Step outside, turn left or right, and there it is. Yum!Tea, coffee, snacks and cereals are available all day and we really appreciated the breakfast pastries that appeared in the kitchen area each morning. Every need is anticipated. There's a washing machine (free to use), additional snacks and drinks can be purchased on an honesty based system and there's a cool roof terrace where you can check out the Bangkok skyline.All in all we were super impressed.

971,"Was really impressed with Loog Choob Homestay from the moment they reached out via email requesting our arrival time. They provided us multiple mobile numbers to help our taxi driver find them as well as an estimate of how much a *metered* taxi should cost. Upon arrival we were provided a small tourist information packet that included maps (useful!) to nearby ATMs, 7-Elevens, bus stops, local markets, tourist sites etc. and places to dine. After check-in, we were provided a tour of the facilities. Holy! They thought of everything a traveller could need! From complimentary use of a washing machine, to mini-kitchen stations offering all manner of breakfast necessities. In addition, there were frozen and refrigerated snacks/meals and beverages available (pay using honour system). Even with the fresh baked goods (croissants, raisin bread, donuts etc) left out each morning, the really impressive part was the general design of the place. If you appreciate architecture, you'll really enjoy Loog Choob Homestay. Exquisitely modern, chic and practical - the interior design is an experience in and of itself. The use of space, light, colour, and glass is amazing. Of the many (near) floor to ceiling double-doored windows (many in common areas and on private patio overlooking canal) all were framed with lovely tropical grasses. The professionalism and thoughtfulness that went into every detail made me feel lucky to share in Loog Choob's architect's vision.The staff were very helpful throughout our 3 night stay and the room rate provided excellent value. As for location, Wat Saket, on the main boulevard, is ~15 min walk from Loog Choob and Kao San about 25 min. The tree-lined canal out front was lovely to walk and tuk tuks are easily accessible at the street corners. Lastly, check out the roof top yard - it is quite large, breezy and provides a nice view of the area.All-in-all our stay at Loog Choob exceeded our expectations and we'd highly recommend it to friends and family.

976,"The home stay is very conveniently located and beautifully designed. Also very clean and comfortable. The owners are exceptionally helpful and friendly. The rooms are done up beautifully. Will definitely stay here again the next time we visit Bangkok.The little touches that make it special - the owners keep the pantry stocked with snacks and frozen foods for a late night meal or an early breakfast. The rooftop has a lovely view of the Bangkok skyline, and is a perfect place to relax in the evenings.","April 28, 2016","17    Loog Choob Homestay

978,Loog Choob Homestay is a tastefully decorated small hotel in a good location. All potential destinations for a Bangkok visit can easily reached by TukTuk. The hotel owners were very helpful in every aspect providing good tips and equipping us with a map and a guide for TukTuk drivers written in Thai (since many of them do not speak English). That way we easily found every sightseeing spot and safely returned home. The hotel is absolutely recommendable for a tourist visit to Bangkok.,"April 9, 2016","17    Loog Choob Homestay

980,"Practical review for those seriously considering the place:Location - The homestay is located in the old part of town. Quiet street. Near 2 local market (one about 3-5 minute walk the other 5-10 minute walk). Local eateries/street food nearby but not much restaurants - these where about 15-20 minute walk.The nearby buildings are usually old stores or old residences. Not many taxis go by this place and you would have to walk to the main street to get one. A little bit difficult to get taxi especially during rush hour.Taxi drivers are sometimes not familiar with this place. Even my Thai tour guide got a little bit lost. However, the owner gives out a little map written in Thai that you can use to show the taxi drivers - usually after a bit of head scratching they would find the place. BTS is far so you can either hire a tuktuk (not readily available either) or get a taxi. About 10-20 min taxi ride to the Grand Place, depending on traffic. Service - was excellent! I believe it is managed by the owner's family. Ms. Sue is usually the one at the reception/office during the day was really friendly, helpful and kind. She asked about our plans, gave out good advice, even printed us a map to one of our destination and wrote the direction in Thai for the taxi driver. She allowed us to check in at 10:30am and personally took us to our room and toured us around the place to show the different amenities. The reception is not all day but you are given your key to open the back door if you come in later than 10:30pm. You can also use the phone at the foyer area to call them if you have an emergency during the night. Ms. Sue also kindly arranged a taxi for us when we had to leave at 5am for the airport and saw us out. Place - Part of a building that has been beautifully converted into a homestay. Amazing design, modern but homey at the same time. You feel like you are living at a high end apartment. Small but very charming. lots of light with floor to ceiling windows, several sitting areas, play area (with board games), small library with good books/magazines, desktop computer you can use. Each floor has a common living/eating area with a pantry. The pantry has microwave, hot kettle, toaster, bottled water (aside from the ones inside the room), milk, cereals, hot choco/coffee, basic snacks - there are plates, cups/bowls/ spoon and forks - you can use. On the 4th floor is a freezer that stocks frozen meals and ice cream you can buy at a minimal prize. On the ground floor are drinks you can also buy. There is a rooftop area where you can hang out and see the surrounding area. It's too hot to go during the day but really nice in the evening. There is an area where you can lounge but would have been nice if there were some bench or chairs ...Room - I believe they have 5 rooms; 3 twin room (on the 4th floor), 1 junior and 1 master suite (5th floor). We got the twin room. The beds were low, quality hotel beddings, 4 pillows (firm but fluffy enough) and looks to be plus size single. The room has TV with cable, DVD (website said there was DVD library but never got to ask about it) small bedside table with lamp and 1 chair, no alarm clock, no phone (I think?), Sink outside the bathroom. Small refrigerator, no safe, no closet but lots of wooden pegs and hangers for your clothes. Soap/shampoo, hair dryer provided but no dental kit. Closed balcony area that has chairs for lounging. No problem with air con. Water pressure from the shower was very strong. Room was absolutely clean, no complains. Like most Thai homes, they request that you either go barefoot inside the room or use the cloth slippers they provided. Shoes will be left in an area outside the elevator. The only thing I didn't like is that there was no lock for the bathroom. There is only a cut-out from the glass (i'll include picture). So smell or sound may sometimes escape :) Breakfast is not included but the owners would thoughtfully put out a couple of breads/pastries in the morning near the coffee machine. Strong wifi.Reservation - Very easy. Just use the reservation form on their website and they usually respond within the day to confirm. No need to make a deposit. They provide a detailed map you can give to the taxi driver at the airport. Price - B2100/night seem reasonable for a double room. This may seem very cheap to some (mostly visitors from outside Asia) but consider that there are 2-3 stars hotels in Bangkok that can be had for B2000-2500/night and hostel/inns at B1000-1500/night. The price of Loog Choob seems about right especially considering the review on the place.Final verdict? If you are laid back, like to relax, mix in with locals but feel more at home in a quiet neighborhood, this place is for you. A bit far from the city center so keep this in mind when considering this place.","March 6, 2016","17    Loog Choob Homestay

982,"My husband and I stayed here only one night despite originally booking for two. It was our first stop when we arrived to Thailand and unfortunately our flights were delayed 2 days due to a large snow storm that hit the day we were supposed to fly out. I rescheduled the dates with Sukanya multiple times as our plans kept changing, and she was always understanding and accommodating. I really appreciated this given all the stress we were under having to reschedule all of our plans at the last minute. The guesthouse itself is very nice. It has a cute little elevator. Drinks are provided downstairs in a cooler (water, soft drinks, beer), with a bucket where you pay on your honor. The roof has nice views of the city. The room itself was clean and comfortable. The bathroom was well equipped and nice.The bed was a bit hard, but we found this to be the case throughout Thailand. There are basics provided for breakfast - some croissants, cereal, Keurig coffee, etc. The location is good. It's close to a cool little market that we wandered into and it's a short tuk tuk ride to the main tourist attractions like Wat Pho and the Grand Palace. My only complaint is that we almost missed our flight out of Bangkok because the taxi that Sukanya ordered never showed. We waited 45 minutes before we were able to get one and we were panic stricken after an already stressful experience with our flights to Thailand. I know this was not her fault, but take my advice and allow extra time for this!","February 11, 2016","17    Loog Choob Homestay

984,"My husband and I stayed at LoogChoob Homestay for two nights. The location is excellent and easy to get to; we arrived at the Suvarnabhumi Airport and took the Airport Rail Link to Phaya Thai station. From there, we were able to hail a taxi / tuk tuk to the airport. The cost of the taxi / tuk tuk ranged from 70 - 150 baht. The Homestay is a five story building with the owners' family living on the 2nd floor. There are four to five guest rooms are on the 4th floor, which is where we stayed. Sue was our host and spoke very good English. She was very friendly and helpful. The building and the rooms were extremely clean. The rooms felt spacious (we had just traveled in Hong Kong) and had an adjoining balcony. We didn't have much time to enjoy the balcony. The showers were great with good pressure and plenty of hot water. The AC worked well. The location was very quiet, which is what we prefer. We would highly recommend staying here.

985,"I stayed here with my wife and twelve year old daughter in January 2016. Just like other posters here, we were really happy we chose to stay at Loog Choob Homestay. The apartment was a great haven of luxury and privacy, with very tasteful modern design features, plenty of space and all comforts taken into account. The family run business is very friendly indeed. The neighbourhood is a delight, particularly if you enjoy exceptional street cuisine, of which there is much to choose from in the local market and surrounding streets. The apartment is really well set up,that we often brought our food back upstairs and ate in relative style in the kitchen/lounge area; a real treat! This is a part of Bangkok that is just off the well worn tourist trail and western travellers are somewhat of an oddity! The well established residential and local retail environs are a taste of real Bangkok life and the locals are exceptionally friendly, regularly helping us to make sure we were looked after at the little restaurants dotted around the place. After having travelled through this great city for many years, we were delighted to have discovered something new about it and somewhere we will most definitely return to on our next trip to Thailand.","January 22, 2016","17    Loog Choob Homestay

986,"We took our time selecting Bangkok accommodation as 3 nights with 2 adult daughters could go badly wrong. Research paid off.. we struck gold with the family suite in the Loog Choob. Was SO MUCH BETTER than a hotel with plenty of room and washing machine facility and coffee machine and roof top terrace, perfect for sunset drinks. The location may not be perfect but didn't bother us a bit. Taxis are super cheap and the walk from central tourist area is only 20 mins and who wants to stay there anyway. Another gold star goes to the helpfulness and hospitality of the owner and her uncle who became like our personal assistants. We will stay there again next time in Bangkok for sure.

On the positive side, the staff was friendly and readily available to accommodate us. The B&B is located within walking distance of the riverfront and water taxis as well as the sky train. The house is quite old and interesting, but needs some updating. But, the price is reasonable which is why I booked it. All that being said, I’m rating it “Average” but wouldn’t stay here again.

I personally loved the huge shower and tiling. Very tasteful and elegant while still being homey and comfortable. Also very close to transportation (Sky Train) and easy to catch tuk tuks or cabs wherever you want to go. The only catch is that it is between two highways so if you are outside the traffic is very loud, and there isn't quite room outside or around the hotel to lounge without hearing loud traffic. This isn't a problem at all in the rooms though, you can hardly hear the traffic and it is very peaceful in the rooms. So if you are okay with your room being a place you come to hang out in at night and sleep and you're out and about during the day and evenings, like we were, it is perfect!

There was a highway built over the top of the house and a main road was in front. It did quiet down during the night but in the morning the rush hour traffic would wake us up. Next time I think we would ask for a room in the back of the hotel. The breakfasts were incredible and very tasty. There were some good restaurants nearby as was the metro.

We were welcomed with a delicious icedtea and a cold towel to refresh ourselves. All the people working here are so friendly and helpfull. And speak english very well. They provided us with a little map of the area with all the restaurants, bars, public transport etc. We tried two of the recommended restaurants and they were both great! We paid 800 baht for a pick-up when we arrived, But when we left they helped us get a taxi to the airport which costed only 300. The breakfast was simple but nice.

1006,"We stayed 2 nights in this little hotel surrounded by 2 huge roads not far away from the ferry station Saphan Taksin and BTS Station Surasak.The hotel looks like an old colonial time house from former times. Its small but well kept garden and pool area made us feel relaxed as soon as we walked into the hotel's premises. I guess it were the owners who welcomed us in an extremely friendly and attentive way and offered their help with whatever we might be in need of. As a side note, they spoke great English! The room was small, but very clean and tidy. Their housekeeping does a very good job maintaining the hotel's neat atmosphere. Also the furnishings keep up the colonial idea from the lobby.We had a king size bed which was very comfortable. The linen and the towels were extremely clean, which is not always the standard in South East Asia. Small details like some earplugs and 2 small bags of anti mosquito repellent which were offered in the room rounded up the overall impression that this hotel is administered by a very caring owner.Concerning the noise: Before booking we saw already that the hotel is close by 2 big streets but we still thought we'd give it a try. And yes, it was constantly a bit louder than in other hotels but not as loud as the location would suggest. They did a very good job to quieten down the rooms and the noise that still comes in can still be handled by the earplugs that are provided. On the first morning we got a freshly French pressed coffee together with some fruit and an egg filled crepe for breakfast. It was very delicious and they even offered a second round in case we still wanted to eat more. The next morning we had to leave earlier than the breakfast hours (8 am -10 am) but they still gave us a small breakfast to go including a sandwich and a drink. So altogether I can definitely highly recommend this hotel to people who don't care about a bit of noise. The owners and their staff make more than up for that. I would always come back.

1007,"I have rarely stayed at a place, whether a B&B or hotel, where I have looked forward to coming home, so to speak, after a day out. My stay here was so comfortable and relaxing that I wanted to stay longer. The owners and staff were warm and welcoming, attentive when needed and they provided a wealth of information about Bangkok and surrounds, when asked. The eighty year old building is charming and well maintain. It is located near a SkyTrain station and there are a variety of eating places nearby, from street vendors to over-the-top elegant. One note, however; the Baan Pra Nond is nestled between a busy street and an elevated motorway; so, there is traffic noise. I did not find that noise bothersome enough to dampen my enthusiasm for this B&B and its lovely staff. When I return to Bangkok, I will stay here.","February 17, 2017","18    Baan Pra Nond Bed & Breakfast

1008,"We absolutely loved our stay at Baan Pra Nond B&B. The inn itself is enchanting -- with historic character, comfortable rooms, a swimming pool, super-helpful hosts and a friendly dog! Another huge bonus is that it is in easy walking distance of a sky train stop, which is essential to getting around Bangkok. It is also near several top-notch restaurants, so there is no need to go to another part of the city for a first-rate meal. They are also vegan friendly, offering soy milk and other vegan options for breakfast.","January 24, 2017","18    Baan Pra Nond Bed & Breakfast

1009,"Situated at the southern end of Bangkok, this place is easily missed by taxi... An amazing old building renovated in good style... When you enter, you are greeted by the cutest dog and the lovely owners! They really go out of there way to make your stay comfortable, plus the make the best... breakfast.... ever!!! Rooms are quite basic, but provide everything you need. There's an A/C and decent beds. The pool is very enjoyable, especially after a humid day in the city! Would definitely advise people to stay here, we'll definitely be back for more!","November 17, 2016","18    Baan Pra Nond Bed & Breakfast

1010,"So many hotels in Bangkok have no character, so it is fantastic to stay in one that has a personality, run with love by the hands on owners. (The mother of one of the owners was also helping out, a wonderful lady full of great conversation and tips.)The decor is a beautifully rendered Colonial/Thai in a neighbourhood close to the ferries and Skytrain. Everyday breakfast was different and tasty, we will be back for sure and will heartily recommend.","October 19, 2016","18    Baan Pra Nond Bed & Breakfast

A great small guest house with the personal touch.Rooms are very clean, showers great and the breakfast is just enough at the start of your day.If your like me who does big hotels for business, this makes a great change.Close to Skytrain station and river boat taxis.Already booked another night at end of this trip!Oh and make sure you say hello to Logan the Beagle and get him to show you his tricks.

1013,"This was a pleasant place to stay in Bangkok. Although the hotel is located in a very busy area, the traffic noise did not bother us. I liked the fact the property was situated so close to the BTS station and plenty of restaurants and spots to see. The highlight of this property are the staff. So friendly and helpful, and the breakfast is made with care and delicious, something fresh and different each day. The room was cute with nice details like earplugs but I give the property four stars instead of 5 because the room was quite small. However, we loved the pool, very nice for cooling off after a hot day and the hotel is small and much more like an old mansion that a hotel, which we loved. I would recommend this spot to anyone looking for a hotel with character.","August 29, 2016","18    Baan Pra Nond Bed & Breakfast

1014,"The service provided by the staff at Baan Pra Nond was outstanding. Janya is an absolute star both on email prior to our visit and once we had arrived and needed suggestions for where to go etc. It really did make a difference.The B&B is beautifully done and the rooms have plenty of character. It's a real oasis in the heart of the city. The only problem for us was the noise and being light sleepers we found it difficult to switch off from the traffic nearby. Aside from that, it's a great location and the recommended restaurants were superb.","August 2, 2016","18    Baan Pra Nond Bed & Breakfast

1015,"I decided to book this B&B in the last minute. Have never been this place before, but I must say I was impressed since the booking process. The staff made me a phone call to make sure the arrival time. Husband and I arrived the place very late - 2am, but the night shift staff still warmly welcomed us with nice welcome iced tea drinks and cold towels. The place looked as someone's house rather than an inn. There's no reception desk like other places, which I think made the place unique!! Our room was number 9. The size of the room was appropriate; the ceiling was high, so the room was airy and so comfortable! Both of us slept very well, and got up freshly in the morning! However, I would suggest the owner is the shower should have been that kind of being able to move around, and be held by hands. Hubby said the breakfast was nothing special, but I myself quite enjoy it, especially the quality coffee!! We did not try to get in the swimming pool; anyways, it looked scruffy and neglected. I guess it hasn't been used by other guests either. The owner's pet - a lovely dog, was adorable one!! He seemed like a superstar of the place! Overall, I love the experience here as the first time, and I highly recommend it to anyone who seeks for antique, little special place!! ;) Thank you, Baan Pranon!!","March 20, 2016","18    Baan Pra Nond Bed & Breakfast

1016,"Having stayed in hotels each time I visit BKK, Baan Pra Nond made my stay an unforgettable one. We stayed in a standard room (Room 5 on the ground floor) for 4 nights. Despite checking in on a Saturday night, the night staff (a lovely young man) welcomed us with towels and iced tea, which was a perfect start to our stay. To our slight disappointment, our Guest Relations Manager, Logan the Beagle, was fast asleep in the kitchen, but was immediately alerted of the new guests and gave us a warm greeting. Our room was quaint, clean and cosy, despite having a slight mouldy smell as the room could not be aired. The bed was comfy and we slept soundly, knowing we were well taken care of by both our human and furry staff. Every morning, Janya and Logan will greet us at the dining hall. Their warm hospitality is always a great start to our days. Breakfasts at BPN never fail to amaze and fill our tummies. French pressed coffee and orange juice gave us a good perk me up. Freshly baked bread and their variety of western breakfast set us off in our busy day at BKK. A map of the attractions and dining options is also provided in the room, and the staff is always ready to give you a guide to the best places to visit around BPN. 7-11 and the skytrain is just a quick 5 min walk away, but you will have to brave the traffic. DVDs and board games are available, and we enjoyed our night sitting in the dining area, enjoying the tranquility amidst the bustling background noise of the traffic. During our last day, Janya very kindly helped us across the road to hail a taxi to the airport, not before a teary goodbye to our favourite staff, Logan the beagle. We will definitely stay here again during our next stay in BKK. A highly recommended place to stay! A brilliant home away from home, many thanks to the management and furry Guest Relations Manager.","March 15, 2016","18    Baan Pra Nond Bed & Breakfast

1017,"Although this B&B is out of the main tourist centre and popular backpackers area of Bangkok (Khao San Rd) it is still in a good location for exploring the city either by foot, taxi, Sky train or river boat.The B&B itself is sandwiched between express ways so is a little noisy but it's a very peaceful relaxing environment inside and has a pool which offers a nice area to relax in out of the Bangkok hustle and humidity.The staff are helpful and friendly and freshly cook a wonderful breakfast each morning.","March 8, 2016","18    Baan Pra Nond Bed & Breakfast

1018,"There is a lot to chose from in Bangkok but we went for this small B&B to end our vacation in Thailand. It is an extraordinary antique house beautifully preserved in the hearth of the city. The rooms are big and charming and the staff was very helpful and nice, it is a bit noise due to the proximity of 2 big highways but you quickly forget about once inside the house. The breakfast was very good and the staff accommodated to our preferences, also nice was the fact that you could have a cup of tea at any time and that they have an exchange library.","February 11, 2016","18    Baan Pra Nond Bed & Breakfast

1019,"We knew a large, anonymous hotel was not for us - and opted instead for a B & B. We were not disappointed! This immaculately decorated and well run B & B was intimate, private and utterly charming. The homemade breakfast was tailored to our vegetarian diets, and was fresh and delicious. The hosts and all the staff were helpful and friendly. Our room was comfortable and sitting by the pool you would never guess we were in the center of a busy metropolis. We cannot wait to go back!","January 12, 2016","18    Baan Pra Nond Bed & Breakfast

The rooms and the house look great, really beautiful. Pool is not big but big enough for a quick swim after exploring the city. Breakfast is good. We felt at home, kids as well and that is the most important thing.","January 3, 2016","18    Baan Pra Nond Bed & Breakfast

1021,"Another great stay. Breakfast is delicious, service is perfect and the design and decor of the place makes for a tucked-in oasis from the exciting urban life that exists right out the front door. Very convenient to the BTS, yet in a non-touristy neighborhood. Although it's not listed on their website, they offer an inexpensive and efficient laundry service.","December 14, 2015","18    Baan Pra Nond Bed & Breakfast

1022,"It's actually an antique and classic bungalow located nearby BTS Surasak station. Hotel staff warmly welcomed us and told us some helpful local information to us when we checked in. As What I know,they could also help to provide a private tour upon request.The room we stayed was not large,but still comfortable for two. Breakfast was offered randomly by the host which cooked nicely.As the hotel is quite close to the highway and main road,it could be a bit noisy at night sometimes. Earbud is provided in the room in case you might need it.","October 3, 2015","18    Baan Pra Nond Bed & Breakfast

1023,"Hotel was fairly easy to find thanks to google maps location services. Convenient location close to both sky train and water taxis. We used the sky train a lot. It's not far at all. Not much in the way of nightlife nearby, some 7-11 type shops, but some good restaurants by the river. Hotel service is great. Clean, friendly, good breakfast. Seems there is some variety for breakfast, as we had eggs one day and pancakes the next, all delicious. Free coffee in dining room. We did not use the pool, but the wifi is reliable and fast. We stayed in room 5. Quiet, even though it is on the ground floor and nearer to more foot traffic. Some mosquitoes, but good fan/ac, great bathroom and great bathroom soap stuff. We have no complaints about this hotel and would stay here again.","September 29, 2015","18    Baan Pra Nond Bed & Breakfast

1024,we chose to stay at a B&B in Bangkok as opposed to one of the large hotels. we arrived much earlier than the room availability but it wasn't a problem we were greeted by our very friendly host with a refreshing ice cold drink of Thai Tea. Our hosts had a comprehensive list of Tours available did some costings and all the bookings for us. Although situated on a busy road the property was very quiet - we had no problems with any noise.They also provided us with a print out of small map but do get the address and phone number written down in Thai for any Taxi drivers. It is right by one of the Sky train stations however. The hosts are a young family who all spoke perfect English. We would definitely stay there again - thank you so much for our lovely stay.,"September 2, 2015","18    Baan Pra Nond Bed & Breakfast

The sky train is only 5 mins walk away and the boats about the same down behind the guest house passing traditional houses along the alleyways. The breakfasts were varied - waffles, eggs and traditional Thai soup with fruit and toast. There was coffee and tea facilities to help oneself all day long with biscuits.

Yes, it is almost under a highway and yes in a very busy road, but I was there 2 nights and while in the 1st I used the earplugs, in the 2nd I was able to sleep even without them (it was during the weekend, so this may explain why the traffic might not be so bad). A very nice place for those who look for a charming place, clean, comfortable with personality. If you only can find your shelter in the comfort of a conventional standard hotel this is not the place for you.","January 6, 2015","18    Baan Pra Nond Bed & Breakfast

Our room was quiet, despite the location, and beautifully appointed. We didn't use the tiny swimming pool while we were there, but greatly appreciated our balcony after a long day exploring Bangkok. The staff was consistently helpful and friendly, and spoke excellent English. The breakfasts were a daily treat.Baan Pra Nond was like a little oasis of calm and gentility in raw, hectic, wonderful Bangkok, and we would definitely, and happily stay there again.","October 17, 2014","18    Baan Pra Nond Bed & Breakfast

They serve a different Westernstyle breakfast everyday (which tastes delicious!). It's located near a couple of big roads. So especially during the day it's a bit noisy. At night it's more quiet.

The place has such a lovely feeling that you sleep well despite the noise. The breakfast provided each day was varied and delicious. The staff were great and could not have been more helpful.

1037,"We travelled for xmas 2013 and arrived in the evening after a 16 hour flight. Despite the room being on the ground floor and closest to the road, I slept 14 hours, which for me is a record! The bed was fantastically comfortable!The rooms are a good size, with some areas to hang shirts, etc - and some basic luggage space. The bathroom was a good size, though dark (ground floor and hence urtains closed) and the shower had good pressure and hot water / toilettries were in abundant supply (if required). On the ground floor, our room had a slightly moudly smell - probably due to the fact that one could not keep the door open for long periods because of the pollution from the road outside / or the noise. But that is one of the traps of this part of Bangkok.Breakfasts were ok - coffee, the usual supply of breads, a bit of standard fruit, cereals, juice. Hospitality was very friendly and helpful and the building itself has wonderful character.There is a small pool in the back patio, though I did not use it. The location is fine for the skytrain (5 minute walk to the nearest station , though one has to cross a mega busy road) and the river taxi is approx a 15 minute walk. All in all, it is a lovely, friendly B&B - though the location by the room by the road on the ground floor for me was not the best choice - not in terms of sleep quality but general well being.","March 4, 2014","18    Baan Pra Nond Bed & Breakfast

Thank you!The house is in a very busy area of Bangkok with the pros and cons associated with that.

1040,"We stayed at Baan Pra Nond in October and my husband and I had a wonderful time. Be aware that your taxi driver will probably have a hard time finding the place, and Google Maps doesn't seem to recognize the address, so you may want to call ahead to get directions before arriving. The B&B is absolutely beautiful with tons of old-world charm. The location is close to the ferries and train station, so getting around Bangkok is very easy. Our room had it's own little private patio overlooking the pool, which no one else visited while we were there, so it was like our own little oasis.The staff was outstanding and very helpful. I'm gluten intolerant, and they even made me gluten-free muffins during our stay.The only drawback was the noise factor. Once in awhile, the noise from the surrounding neighborhood was a bit much, but our stay was still altogether amazing. Highly recommend!","November 20, 2013","18    Baan Pra Nond Bed & Breakfast

The staff members are eager to help you book tours. So you can have worry-free tour experience. There is a 24-hour 7-11 store right next door; you can buy necessary stuff there; and you can get free hot water either from the restaurant of the hostel or the 7-11 store. There is a computer station in the common space, which is very convenient; you can buy lockers to store your personal items; around the hostel, there are many places you can buy food; there are always taxis and tuk taxis outside the hostel, so you do not need to worry about going out.","July 5, 2019","19    Loftel 22 Hostel

It doesn't have a lift so make sure you grab all of your stuff as you head out for the day ! Our double room was very compact but given that we only used it for sleeping this wasn't a compromise. What absolutely suprised me was the neighbourhood - it's full of Soi to explore and soak up daily Thai life. Also Chinatown is a short walk away, along with Hualamphong train station. The cafe downstairs is also a great spot to perch with an iced coffee and watch Soi life unfold.

1063,"We stayed here 2 nights with a females dorm room, it was clean when we arrive. The bed was small, I think it enough for Asian, the blanket very ragile, they will give you new towels and make up the room in next 3 days. The staff was friendly, smiled. The night receptionist didn't speak English much, it was fine But just 1 thing when we left we asked her to help us send some postcards, She asked me Did I talk to the morning receptionist and if the morning receptionist said Yes, i can leave them with her. I didn't speak to morning receptionist before I told her that. Then she told me to go the airport to send it. Okay, I saw the post office box after that so I left our postcards with the others already in there. When I'm back Viet Nam I sent them the email to remind about it. They said found it and will help us to send it to the post Office. 2 weeks later, I send other email to asked about it. They said ""they don't know how long it will arrive maybe 1 month"" Even from there to Viet Nam is one and half hour fly. So If you want to send anything for your family, your friends from there just do it by yourself I suggested. Because it will take long time to arrive and if you send to Europe or America some place far it take few months haft a year maybe.","March 13, 2017","19    Loftel 22 Hostel

1064,"We stayed here for 3 nights Jan 2017 at the start of our South East Asia trip. The place has a nice feel to it once you step in off the slightly run down area. It is conveniently located and pretty easy to find from Hua Lamphong station which you can get to via a change at Phetchaburi station from the airport. Tickets cost about 70baht together for both trains.We stayed in a private room with a shared shower facing the room. The toilet was just around a little corner and the sink was pretty large in the hallway in between. We were initially sceptical about sharing facilities as this was our first stop in the trip but we need not worry as they were clean and tidy and others respected the shared space! The owner was really welcoming and made us feel at at home every time we saw her.Wifi isn't great at this place however and we kinda struggled using it in our room on the fourth floor.There is a 7-Eleven just below the hostel which is great, the hostel also has its' own cafe open 7am-8pm which sells coffee, beer and snacks. Chinatown is about a 5-10 minute walk down the straight road until you see the archway. Would definitely recommend visiting here for the street food and desserts as well as the street and building signs. Facing Chinatown is the Golden Buddha temple which is also worth seeing, entry is about 40 baht I think.Tuk tuks or taxis will take you into the centre, around the grand place area as I'd say it was a bit too far to walk.","January 23, 2017","19    Loftel 22 Hostel

1065,"Visited Bangkok, Loftel 22 as our first destination as part of our backpacking trip across Asia in June 2016Location: Great Location away from all the chaos of other Thailand Hostels yet very accessible transport and tourist destinations nearby. China Town is a 10 minute walk away & the two main Thai train stations in Bangkok (Hua Lam Pong & Central Railway Station is just another 10 min walk the opposite direction). Overall very easy to navigate around the area and clear instructions on how to reach the hostel via their website.Room Type: Me and my Girlfriend had stayed in a 4 bed mixed dorm for the duration of our stay, the room was very comfortable and also had privacy in terms of being in your bed. All the beds in the room faced a wall which was suitable as it kept with the theme of the room in terms of the basic colors and layout the room. Air-con was provided but at the top of the room so if sleeping on the upper beds it could get chilly at night, the beds where clean and presented well. 2 Toilets & 2 Shower cubicles where shared among other dorms on your floor as well as having two large sinks with mirrors, they were kept clean throughout our stay although one of the toilets lights kept going out. Towels are provided at a loan cost.Other Facilities: They had their own cafe which was decently priced although there are numerous food carts around the block if you’re looking for traditional Thai food for a low cost price. Also had strong WIFI throughout the building apart from the rooftop balcony, public access computers, laundry room & lockers for storage among other things.Staff: Friendly and hospitable, willing to offer advice and even tell you little tricks to help you save cost such as how to get to a certain destination the cheapest way possible. Only downside is when I asked for a first aid kit they did not have anything although they did allow me to shower after I checked out to clean up my wound.Overall: Great stay and a great way to start your adventure especially when you’re looking to take it easy after a long flight, would recommend for social couples or anyone that likes a bit of peace or privacy.","January 22, 2017","19    Loftel 22 Hostel

It's also a district that has a lot of narrow streets to explore and is not overrun by tourists. The hostel is very clean and showers have decent water pressure and good hot water. Double rooms are a little pricey compared to similar options, but the hostel feels secure and is relatively quiet. Unfortunately, wifi is inconsistent throughout the hostel and relatively slow, perhaps because of the construction of the building. Be aware that wifi may or may not work in your room or dorm. The cafe downstairs has good prices and excellent food and coffee. Fantastic location -- five minutes walking to the orange express boats, to the main street food drag in Chinatown, and to the main train station, which also has a nice metro station. If the wifi worked better and it was a bit more affordably priced, this would be a five-star hostel. The hostel is an easy walk from the train station or metro, but if coming from elsewhere via taxi, you will want to screenshot a map to share with your taxi driver.","February 15, 2016","19    Loftel 22 Hostel

The room itself was basic with the usual rock hard bed- but had nice features such as the lights and shelves which were good for storage. Best thing for me was the location. So close to Hua Lamphong station and to china town- in a very non-touristy area. The only other tourists we saw in the area were from loftel! So many good street stalls around and we were never hassled, everyone in the area was extremely friendly. We were on the 4th floor so it was a climb in the humidity and heat- but A/C worked perfectly. Bathrooms were always clean and hot water worked well.

1090,"Loftel 22 is not a party hostel. Despite its dorm set-up, it's one of those laid back hostels that has a cool but relaxed vibe! The A/C here is nice and strong- exactly what you need to survive midday in Bangkok. We were very impressed with their service and when an issue arose, they acted swiftly and professionally to get it resolved ASAP. Location: The location is very good. With just a short 10 minute walk to Hua Lamphong station- it's easy to catch the railway to Chiang Mai, local bus (cheap and not scary at all) or just the MRT around Bangkok. It's also really close to the Marine Pier where you can take a water taxi- my personal favourite after the BTS. There is also a lot of street food and water filter machines in the immediate vicinity! Food: Loftel 22 does great smoothies! Bathrooms: clean, functional, minimal. Nothing bad to say about it at all. Staff: lovely and very accommodating.Overall, I'd definitely recommend this hostel.","December 7, 2015","19    Loftel 22 Hostel

1093,"The good:The shared bathrooms are clean, good for exploring Chinatown on foot but also near MRT Hua Lamphong and the Hua Lamphong railway station should you want to explore the rest of the city. The bad:I stayed in room 133, a private room with the shared bathroom just a couple of steps away. The bed was on the floor which I initially thought was cute but eventually hated the said bed. The mattress was hard like the wooden slab it's on! It was good as lying on the floor - it's that hard. I've stayed in several hostels at this point and have even heard how Southeast Asian beds are hard but this was too extreme for me. There was also this huge wooden block inside the room which was honestly just a waste of space. It would have been nicer if they put the effort into providing a reading light or maybe a small closet instead. The staff are also a little unattentive. I don't expect them to baby me, this is a hostel after all. But there were quite a couple of times during my stay when there wasn't any staff manning the front desk. No breakfast included in the rate, so you either pay up for their café at the lobby or walk around Chinatown for something cheaper.","November 4, 2015","19    Loftel 22 Hostel

I have been watching and waiting Nikko to be built and was happily to give a try.It was such a wrong decision cuz it ruined my entire trip :(1) this trip didn’t start smooth, I took the ‘ ticketed taxi’ from airport and I came across a very bad driver, he suddenly changed his mind from by meter to ask for money once we were out from airport, we didn’t agree and he actually drove around the airport until we used google map and tried our best to talk with him that this is not the right way. It took a long way to hotel and once we arrived I told the hotel staffs I needed help, as this was what I always do when I came across bad taxi drivers, rather than not helping us, the hotel staffs let the taxi driver to take a photo of us and said is normal! We were totally frustrated! From my past experience the hotel staffs would help us talk with the driver or at least let us in and help us with local tourist police! How would they had the driver took a driver of us and said is normal! 2) The chair fall off and was never properly assembled once I sit and I literally fall off! I called the hotel staff and they actually old me I am not the first! That’s crazy!3) Surprised to see stains on carpet, chair and bathroom marble as a newly open hotel!I just had a feeling that the hotel wasn’t ready to be opened, and I was glad I booked Conrad for my 2nd half my trip cuz my first few days was really uneasy at Nikko :(","June 29, 2019","20    Hotel Nikko Bangkok

1101,"the Nikko is a new hotel in Thonglor, one of Bangkok most animated neighbourhood. It is well situated near the BTS train although the best part of Thonglor (best restaurants, bars, etc…) is higher up the street. It is a rather dull 5 stars, certainly not in the luxury category. It is in the same league as Marriott and stuff. However having just opened, it benefits from a fresh decoration and rooms that don’t feel tired, if not particularly exciting. I stayed there for two entire weeks in June 2019 so I had plenty of time to form an opinion. The staff is generally very kind and attentive. My only complaint was that I asked for a toilet brush upon arrival as their toilets don’t have any and I was told the hotel would not provide it. I insisted, spoke to a manager as I don’t like to leave toilet dirty behind me. I was told to go get one by myself. I must say, I spend an awful part of my life in hotels due to work, I have seen all sorts but it is the first time I hear that. Especially on long stays. LoungeI requested access to the lounge. These category of hotels often try to offer a more premium experience with a lounge pretty offering happy hour and finger food starting at 5:30PM as well as a smaller breakfast. It is more secluded and quieter, the staff is absolutely adorable but I tried to work there once and there was only one table near a power socket but it was too far from the router to offer a good internet connection. so I went back to the room. Also you can’t bring a guest for free so in other words, you can’t do your meetings there either. Also it’s freezing in there and the staff couldn’t help. Then I came back a couple of times at their happy hour but the wine on offer was so mediocre I decided to grab a beer instead. Finally, they also offer breakfast and it can be a good option if it is super busy downstairs (it happens) but it is a reduced selection and misses in particular the nice fresh juice bar. So frankly I don’t think it is worth spending the extra money for itbreakfastI was not impressed overall. The music at breakfast is too loud. Why? This is breakfast time, not lounge bar time. Especially with this kind of impersonal lounge stock music. That’s truly annoying. The juice bar however is a great addition. But what would be even greater is to have fresh orange juice in the morning rather than this industrially squeezed one. The selection of fruits is very small: always unripe melon, watermelon, passion fruit and another green exotic fruit. That’s it. The egg bar is very efficient for those into English breakfast. Nothing special but it delivers. The bread selection for those into French breakfast is appalling. That said I was very well looked after once they recognised I was a long stayer. Aoi in particular was really incredible, she remembered my order every morning and bring it to my table. Very nice indeed and appreciated. That is great service. RoomI was staying in a corner room, very bright, a little bigger than their regular. It’s all very new so even though it is pretty impersonal, I liked the natural light wood. You’d have to pull the curtains and open your bed yourself as there is no evening service. That said, I was really pleased with the housekeeping in the morning: they’d take the time to tidy up your cloths and stuff in addition to cleaning up. Restaurant The tempura restaurant looks tacky and uninviting but it serves good food; freezing temperature though, unbearable for europeans. We went there a few times, it is quiet. So to sum up, it is a fine mid range 5 stars, good for business stays but a little dull overall.","June 25, 2019","20    Hotel Nikko Bangkok

1117,"Stayed here twice. The service I would say is very good. But the facilities have a lot of room for improvement. One day the front door broke. Our first day in the first room the drain was clogged and the bathroom flooded. Our handwash sink in one of the bathrooms was basically hanging off the wall. The internet while speedy and reliable did not allow me to connect to my camera systems at my businesses. I informed them in an e-mail prior to this but it still has not been addressed. In addition, hackers can scan the network to find your devices. The bathrooms use quality fixtures, Toto like I use at my own home. However, the shower head in my latest room is not installed correctly so the water actually sprays onto the ceiling and from the ceiling drips down into the shower. I let them know, they never got around to fixing it even over several days. The shower in our bathroom has a tub, and that tub is not sealed to the tiles. So the water runs underneath it and it gets dirty because no one can clean underneath it. So when you take a shower, water continues to flow from the dirty area under the tub and particles come out. In addition, there is significant mold growth in the corners of the shower and they smell funny. Staff need to be equipped with bleach and scrubbers to clean up the corners. Carpet in our room now has bulges in it because it's not installed properly.The location is great, very close to the skytrain and lots of good restaurants in trendy Thonglor. This hotel has a lot going for it they just need to fix all of the shoddy workmanship which is common with a lot of Thai hotels, it's not easy getting Thai builders to do a good job, this I know. So because it's very new I'm sure they're having a heck of a time trying to keep up with all the things that they need to get this hotel in order. Once that is done I'm sure this place will be a fine hotel.","February 27, 2019","20    Hotel Nikko Bangkok

1119,"I love checking out new hotels and when I heard about Hotel Nikko opening up in Bangkok. I made sure I got to see it before I leave town.The minute I arrived, I had over 10+ staff greeting me at the entrance. Not sure if they were waiting for some special guests but I felt like a VIP. Everyone was waiing and bowing when I made my way to the front desk. Everything was fine until I was told that my room was not available yet. Mind you, it was around 3.45pm. So, the great first impression started to wear out.But K.Ploy showed up and tried to defuse the situation by offering an upgraded room (Nikko Club, I believe). I was also given a coupon to receive a welcome drink with some snacks, which K.Ploy proceeded to take care of it for me. While this was a nice welcoming gift, I felt that the coupon-less experience would have been more elegant.The room was new, clean, and not that spacious. I was a bit surprised about the room size but then realized it’s a Japanese hotel and maybe they’d like to provide the full Japanese experience :). The toilet room was quite tiny, as well as the bathroom door. I found myself trying to squeeze through both doors. Now some good stuff — the turndown service was a really nice touch, and bonus points for remote-controlled washlet, a yukata, and a huge selection of TV channels (minus CNN and Fox News — which was kinda weird).After coming back from dinner, I met a very friendly lady named K.Sara, who’s at the executive lounge. I told her that my flight would leave at night on the next day and being able to stay in the lounge after check-out would be nice. She happily invited me over and told me about their afternoon tea and cocktail hour. So that made me happy knowing I wouldn’t have to wander around town in the afternoon.The service at the lounge is what I love the most about this place. All the staff is really, really nice and they make sure you’re well served without invading your privacy. They also helped me out with my bags and picking up laundry, as well as giving me Wi-Fi access to use while in the lounge (thank you ka, K.Bay). They didn’t have to do this since I already checked out at noon but they were so kind and I’m very grateful for that. So, a million thanks to K.Nam, K.Sara, Katsu-san, K.Yot, and K.Kratai for making my last day in Bangkok very pleasant. I’d also like to thank K.Nat and the gentleman wearing glasses (I'm sorry I didn't get your name!) who helped me with my luggage. You guys are so sweet!Given this is a new hotel, I’m impressed with the top-notch service I experienced and would come back again in the future (and perhaps choose a premier corner type which is bigger). Who says you have to go to Japan to experience the Japanese hospitality when there’s Hotel Nikko Bangkok.ありがとうございます。","February 6, 2019","20    Hotel Nikko Bangkok

1120,"Stayed in this hotel after it was opened for a week and was pleasantly surprised. The location is very convenient as its just few minutes from the nearby Thonglo BTS skytrain station and you can get to the restaurants and bars in this area on foot easily. The room was spacious and the toilet is housed entirely in a separate area from the bathroom, with the two divided by the room entryway. The bathroom was very spacious with a bathtub and standing shower area - water pressure was very good and water heats up very quickly. There was also alot of storage spaces in the bathroom itself to put your personal toiletries. The hotel provides Panpuri branded toiletries but surprisingly, there were no vanity kits like cotton and earbuds. There was also mouthwash available (called housekeeping and was informed that). The bed was very comfortable and is on the firm side with very comfortable pillows - unsure if its because they were new, but these down pillows were the best I had slept in hotels so far for its firmness, as I usually need to request for firmer pillows as the down ones are just too soft. Wifi is available and speed was decently fast. There was no room service menu but it could be because the hotel is still new - I would find the lack of room service weird as this is a hotel clearly targeted at Japanese business travelers, so would have thought room service is a norm.The service from staff was exceptional! Imagine thai graciousness with japanese hospitality traits. Some housekeeping staffs are still new so they tend to forget something when requesting for then over the phone but overall, from bellhop to front desk, staffs are generally friendly without being intrusive. One evening, i walked in with both hands carrying a box and the staff saw me as I was approaching the elevator and immediately assisted by pressing all the buttons.","January 26, 2019","20    Hotel Nikko Bangkok

1122,"I have always been a frequently visitor of this hotel. But my recent trip was by far the best because I met with one of the staff that did me a huge favor, Ms Orn.I checked into the hotel only at 10pm. I approached the only staff, Ms Orn, during her shift and wanted to check in. I asked if the hotel is fully booked and fortunately it wasn't. I requested to extend the check out timing and added I was very willing to pay for the extended hours if it was possible. After understanding my predicament with a long day i had to travel that present day, and a flight that was going out back home the next only at 5pm, she agreed to extend my check out timing to 1400hours without any additional charges. She only requested for me to revisit the hotel when I am back in Bangkok. Being said so, I told her to check my records as I am already a regular customer of them. I did not have to identify myself as a regular for her to extend the hours for me. This may be something simple to most, but if felt really good on my end that a staff was empowered to make such decisions after understanding they're customer's plight. I had a really good rest before checking out the next day.Big shout-out to Ms Orn for making a splendid decision to make a customer happy. As a customer, I would have understood that if the hotel is fully booked and it would be fine if she couldn't help me anyhow. Ms Orn, you have retained a very happy customer.Thank u!","July 11, 2019","21    The Residence on Thonglor by UHG

When i arrived the room was small and not user friendly and the so called balcony was only standing room only. The most disappointing was the view of the hospital carpark next door - not the city view as i thought i was getting! lol I went downstairs to be told that garden view room would cost extra. I insisted i was not happy and she begrudgingly gave me a garden view room. The view was definitely better and quite soothing. Unfortunately it was dirty and tired. the couch had marks and stains that meant there is no way i would sit on it, The Aircon had old water damage on the walls . The bathroom was dirty and the table had something sticky on it. I went to make a cup of tea and the cup was dirty. At this point I did not want another room. My Expedia booking said 'no changes or cancellations' but i felt the Residence at Thonglor did not live up to their end of the agreement.The positives are that the lobby and breakfast areas are beautifully decorated and have a relaxing ambiance. The pool is beautiful and the onsen (hot tub ) though a reason why i booked the hotel was only lukewarm. The bed was very comfortable and i had a great nights sleep.I will say that Expedia requested a refund and it was gratefully approved so I was able to go to another hotel without loosing money.To summarize your money will go a lot further at many other places in Bangkok","November 2, 2018","21    The Residence on Thonglor by UHG

I was swiftly acknowledged and checked in. I was upgraded to a one bedroom panorama apartment. This was a few categories above what I booked.The room is absolutely lovely. Windows all around - sure is a panorama with great views from the 8th floor. This was a great first impression and left me with a positive feeling about the hotel.It is right above a Family Mart which is really convenient for late night snacks and anything you need. The washer / dryer machine was particularly useful to catch up on all the laundry. Breakfast is truly nothing special and caters more for Asian guests rather than western, but staff are helpful and keen to look after their guests. Not worth the 300 baht fee but mine was included. The rooftop pool was lovely at night with views across the city. It was disappointing that the Onsen wasn’t at the proper temperature.The free internet can be slow at times and the free shuttle to Thonglor BTS even left us behind one morning so there’s a few things that could be improved.

We needed to be on Thong lo for various engagments and so this hotel was in a perfect situation.The staff at this hotel were absolutely wonderful, always polite, friendly and willing to help. Special thanks have to be given to Miss Toom who repeatedly drove me to different obscure places in the Shuttle bus, brought food up to our room, and always greeted us with a cheerful smile at breakfast.There are various restaurants and supermarkets within walking distance of the hotel as well as the BTS station and the river ferry for those that wish to go further afield. For those that don't wish to walk/if it is heavily raining then the hotel offers a shuttle service along Thonglor, and the staff are always very helpful, dropping one off at peculiar destinations throughout the day and evening.Our first stay was on the sixth floor, which was quieter, had a separate bedroom and sitting room, and had better views from the windows, but had one double bed rather than two singles. Our second stay was on the third floor. This was a little noisier due to our proximity to the hospital and road, but we had two single beds and this was more convenient for using the stairs (I'm not a fan of lifts).I am not much of a traveller, but if I return to Bangkok then I will definitely look to stay here again.","August 15, 2018","21    The Residence on Thonglor by UHG

The rooms whatever you book are great, all large with kitchen facilities and washing machine which is so good when you are here for a week or two at a time. The hotel is relatively new and the finish on the rooms in general is great. You have plenty of room to move around, nice bathrooms and really good quality toiletries. They have a reception area on the 2nd floor which 99% of the time is very friendly and helpful. Breakfast each day is nice, not huge but good enough with eggs to order, fruits and the usual Asian breakfast things which most eat for dinner :)The Thonglor area is a nice place to be, lots of small bars and restaurants, free shuttle most of the day to Thonglo BTS so you can get into town too and a short walk to the river taxi stop if you are more adventurous...

I spoke to staff about this three times hoping they would be able to do something about it, nothing was done.

1181,"Intentionally stayed in Khlong San, away from the hustle and bustle of downtown Bangkok. The suburbia neighbourhood was a good change with the street vendors, local shops and smells spicing up the experience ! The corner Tesco Express, 7-11 shops and Ten of Cups Cafe were wonderful with their wide assortment of food and beverages. Room 103 with its attached washroom was tidy and adequately sized. Its balcony (looked into the adjacent apartment block and there was literally no real view) was dusty and noisy during breakfast time as there were some renovation works within the premise. Situation was not adverse as I was out and about immediately after brekky and works had ceased upon my return late at night. The local Thai vegetarian fare (upon request) was delicious with fluffy steamed white rice and stir-fried vegetables washed down with hot veggie soup and black americano. To conclude the meal local fruits and yoghurt were served on two different days. The lobby and dining room was pleasant with its double volume ceiling space and was tastefully put together with numerous striking light pendants whilst the seats and tables were thoughtfully selected and placed throughout the well-lit public lounge. Phat at the front desk was friendly and particularly helpful on local sights and sounds as well as afforded attentive service throughout the two breakfasts I had during my stay. I Grab-ed to get into the city and had no problem returning using the same mode albeit with a higher fare compared with BTS. I would recommend this premise for its friendly service and the room rate (inclusive of brekky) but the distance one is required to travel from the city may not be to everyone's liking.

1186,"I’ve read so many good reviews about this hotel before I booked. We arrived in Bangkok at almost 12 pm. I was afraid that the hotel had cancelled my booking since we weren’t there at almost 12 pm. Tried call the hotel but the man on the other side can’t speak english so I’ve decided to have other plan in case their rooms are fully booked.Located in the small alley, I thought we’be lost our way to the hotel. Wasn’t so sure with the GPS but we’re still followed it anyway. Taxi driver also didn’t know the location. However it is very close to one of BTS station called Krung Thonburi. It makes you easier to travel around the city.We finally arrived and the room service guy standby in front of the door and helped us with our baggages. He showed us 2 A4 printed paper with my name in one of it. And I was like thank God they didn’t kick us out for arriving so so late, almost the next day.It is a small hotel, I think 2 or 3 star. Wouldn’t call it a hotel also, more like a motel. The design of the lobby and the breakfast area is very very nice and artistic. I love how they designed and put it all in one place to make you feel comfy and cozy while enjoying your breakfast. Since this is more like a motel, don’t expect any elevator. You have to step into ladder which is fine for me. Our room was on the top floor and it was 4th floor. Lobby is in the Ground floor, 2nd floor is like an entertainment / living room with a flat TV, a comfy sofa, and they put also a keyboard and a guitar and some board in the table to play in case you bring along your children.The room was a bit small but still okay and fit for me as an asian people. It was very clean, bedsheet is very white and very very comfy, bathroom also very clean and nice. They have 2 kinds of showers which you can choose.From all of things, I really love the breakfast menu. It is not much of choice and just ordinary american breakfast but quite delicious. It starts at 07.30-10.00. Their staff available at 7am until 7pm I guess. So if you have any plans begins before 7am, it means you will have to find a breakfast outside. But no worries, small street foods already available at that time so you wouldn’t be starving.I would really recommend this place if you look for a low budget hotel with a good location and clean place.","May 13, 2018","22    White Ivory Bed & Breakfast

1187,"The staff here is truly exceptional. A quick story. The morning we were checking out and leaving the country, they graciously printed our boarding passes and called a fancy massage place across town for us to make a reservation. We left, got into a cab and went to the massage. Little did we realize, my partner had left his wallet in the room somehow. The hotel staff sent an email but we didn't have wifi and didn't get it. They then called the massage place to track us down. They detailed every item in the wallet, how much money etc and then arranged to have it sent across town to us, so we didn't have to miss our massage to get the wallet back before flying out. When they sent it with the courier, they thoughtfully put it in a sealed envelope so we could be secure nothing would go missing. I can't imagine any hotel in the states going to such lengths or having such a deep sense of hospitality. We were very impressed. The hotel itself is lovely. A 10 minute walk from the BTS station.

We had a hassle free check in and check out. My wife was expecting and we missed out mentioning this at the time of booking. We were allotted a room on the 4th floor without a lift. However, the staff were very helpful in helping us carry the bags to the room. They have a small cafe which serves good breakfast and coffee.. Overall, it’s a wonderful place that leaves you with the feeling of wanting to come back again.Tip: There is no elevator and some of the rooms are located on higher floors which will need climbing 4-5 floors","February 11, 2018","22    White Ivory Bed & Breakfast

1191,"This B & B is a good balance between being off the beaten path and still accessible to the train. It's an ideal base from which to see the city. I would definitely stay here again.Pros:Modern and clean. Fridge and TV in the room.In ""real"" neighborhood where you can get a feel of Bangkok. Plan to spend some time walking around the immediate neighborhood.Several blocks from a 7-11 and about 10 minutes from a train stop.Serves great breakfasts with great coffee drinks, with several options. Order breakfast and schedule time the evening before. (Be sure to try the Thai option.)The attentive and helpful staff speak good English.The bed is softer than most Asian beds.The shower is really nice even though you can expect some water to get on the bathroom floor. The staff is friendly, attentive, and helpful.Comfortable common area, computers. Adequate wifi.Cons:Obscure location for taxi drivers. Make sure you have the directions the White Ivory provides.There are many street vendors close by, but if you want a more standard restaurant, you will take a good walk.No elevator, but the staff is very proactive to carry your luggage.My room was on the street side, so I could hear some street noise and occasionally people outside my room, but it was not bad.","February 4, 2018","22    White Ivory Bed & Breakfast

1202,"Stayed in White Ivory for 4 nights. It is located in a rather small lane and at first I was a bit skeptical of how it will look like. Friendly staff greet us. The room itself was clean and pretty good. The size isn’t as big as the picture and the balcony was actually blocked by the wall. I would say those were the downside of the room. Other than that, bed is comfortable, room and bathroom were clean. They have TV, hair dryer, fridge. So pretty good amenities. Its close to the BTS station and there are food and coffee nearby. Good noodle soup next door. Mini markets nearby too. I actually really like the fact that it is located in more of a residential area rather than touristy area. I feel like I see more of how Bangkok looks like. However, if your sole purpose of visit is to shop in Pratunam, the location might not be ideal.","October 12, 2017","22    White Ivory Bed & Breakfast

There is attention to detail in each and every corner, from the decor of the hotel, to the cutlery. You will not miss the elephant theme even in your cappuccino cup. The rooms were spacious with a cosy balcony (doesn’t have a view) for finishing off your takeaway from the Klongsan market :). The first floor is a lounge area with a music corner and board games. The hotel itself is insta-worthy from all angles.Noon recommended places to visit and eat (will not forget the lip-smacking Pad thai from Thipsamai) and even gave us a small souvenir polaroid which was a lovely gesture.All in all it was a great stay and we would definitely book again for our next visit to Bangkok.

There is a computer available for use if needed, and I loved that they had lots of travel books available. Breakfast is good - you can have American or Thai style breakfast, and the coffee is REALLY GOOD. Right outside are lots of food vendors so you dont have to go too far for a snack.

Free bottled drinking water is provided every day. The location is a bit off the beaten tourist track but a 7 minute walk to the BTS station so very convenient and a more authentic experience than the tourist areas.

1213,"I spent two nights at this lovely bed and breakfast. While I think I spent enough time to really explore Bangkok, I wish I could have stayed one or two more nights just because the stay at this hotel was so wonderful! I actually did not stay 2 consecutive nights here; the nights were separated by a 3-day trip to Kanchanaburi. However, I asked the hotel if I was able to leave my large suitcase there since I was returning in 3 days, and without hesitation, they said I could. I offered to pay them a bit for the inconvenience, but they refused to take my money. The example I described above is just one of many examples of how wonderful and helpful the staff at this hotel is. They were great with helping me to arrange tours, calling taxis/Uber rides to help me get around town, and anticipating my needs. Noon, who is the owner, is wonderful also. She gave me a very detailed map of Chatuchak Market when I went so that I could be sure to never be lost.The rooms themselves were incredibly spacious and clean. They had a very sleek, modern look, and you have to love that they shape the towels into elephants and put them on your bed. The beds were also very comfortable. The only downside that I see in staying here is that it is a bit out of the way in that it is not in the center of downtown but more on the outskirts. However, I like that it's not right in the hustle and bustle of the city, and personally, when I travel, I enjoy being in an area with more locals. This definitely fit the bill. While the BTS station is not too far away, I never got the hang of finding the most efficient route to and from the station. This is likely because I didn't spend enough time staying in the area. Overall, I had a wonderful experience, and I would not hesitate to stay here again.","July 14, 2017","22    White Ivory Bed & Breakfast

1221,"We spent 4 days in Bangkok, then a little bit more than a week in Koh Tao, and then another day in Bangkok before flying out of Thailand. The first 4 days in Bangkok left us with mixed feelings after all the scams and dishonesty we experienced. So after that we weren't looking forward to that last day in Bangkok to be honest. Luckily, we booked a room in the White Ivory B&B for that last night in BKK - we couldn't believe how honest, friendly, sweet, helpful, and courteous the staff was! They made us feel like being home. This was on top of the B&B itself being perfect! It offers everything you could wish for at a super high level of cleanliness and with an extreme attention to details (e.g. the dishes are hand-made, matching the 'white ivory' theme) and quality (e.g. the coffee and food). More info: The service, the rooms, the lobby, breakfast - everything for a very fair price!! The employees are extremely helpful (lending us money for the taxi, arranging a late check-out, hanging on to our backpacks after check,-out, providing shampoo and soap for taking a shower AFTER check-out to wash off the sweat from a long day in Bangkok and before a long flight back home) and super nice! The B&B is very close to a train station and there areis also a lot of local restaurants in the area. The fact that it's not downtown or close to the main attractions is a huge plus because you avoid the crazy tourist crowd but get to the attractions super easy and cheep by train.

They provided us with lots of information about things to do and went above and beyond to make our stay a good one. As well as the great staff the room was lovely, always clean and nicely decorated and breakfast was delicious with choice and good quantities to keep you going. Bangkok is a busy and hectic city and coming back to this b&b was great for chilling out. We thought the location was perfect, it's in a local neighbourhood so it didn't feel touristy at all and it's really close to the sky train which we used everyday to move around as traffic in the day is a nightmare. There are restaurants around you just have to walk five-ten minutes. Wifi worked well too.","January 9, 2017","22    White Ivory Bed & Breakfast

It is situated in the Thewet area, which is great because it’s just a little bit away from the hustle and bustle of Khao San Road area. You can get the river ferry from the pier for 15 baht to take you to loads of the tourist attractions (China Town, Wat Arun, Wat Pho, Grand Palace etc.) and then also to Central Pier where you can get onto the skytrain to do some shopping and try the amazing food in the food courts!Breakfast was included which was so tasty - a real mixture of Asian and Western food with some fresh fruit, milk and juice every morning. The staff welcomed us every single morning and it made us feel completely at ease.If you think it’s right for you, don’t hesitate because this hotel is perfect and it is such a reasonable nightly rate!","June 3, 2019","23    Phranakorn-Nornlen Hotel

The staff serving the breakfast are nice and love playing with my little daughters. The hotel is not close to any BTS station and you may need to take a taxi (or call GRAB) to the city big station.

1255,"I decided to stay at Phranakorn-Nornlen Hotel rather than a western-style hotel to get more of a feel of the ""real"" Bangkok. Unfortunately, the trade-off was a lack of nearby dining (street food predominates in this area, but I didn't think I could eat street food without a stomach reaction, however the nearby restaurants were awful), and local transportation problems (as the hotel itself admits, taxis cannot find this place; they offer a map which did not seem to help the taxi drivers at all, and several refused to take me back to the hotel). The rooftop dining room pictured in some of the photos here was not open. The hotel offered breakfast and dinner in the street-floor lobby; it was of mediocre quality. The room itself was fine; be prepared for a shower that is part of the bathroom, and to be REQUIRED to take off your shoes before entering the room. The staff was responsive to requests but not always available, especially the young lady taking meal orders. (I came down for breakfast at the opening time one morning to find a closed sign on the counter that remained there for the next 10 minutes. I supposed this is part of the promoted 'slow living' and I just don't have the patience, I expect breakfast to be available when posted). The lobby area with cushions and fans appeared to be a lovely way to spend the hot afternoons, but unfortunately I never got a chance to use them, they were monopolized by several young families and couples. The hotel promotes a real Thai garden, and I guess this is what they call a garden, but most plantings were outside the hotel boundaries. I had expected that a hotel of this nature would also have friendly people staying there and a friendly staff, but the general air was of coldness. None of the workshops promoted on the website were offered during the three days I stayed here.","March 8, 2019","23    Phranakorn-Nornlen Hotel

Disappointingly there was no safe, mini fridge nor tea/coffee making facilities in the room, but there was a communal fridge at the end of the corridor and kettle there too. Reception staff were friendly and helpful. My wife was ill during our stay and the staff were lovely and caring. We got their own airport transport from the airport which was good, safe and polite. They were happy to organise a birthday surprise for my wife which was a really nice touch. It's location is good for the river and various tourist ferries and only 100 THB yuk-yuk ride from the centre of Bangkok. The only things that let it down were the breakfast and the wifi. Cold fried eggs or rice are not my thing. Although the range of food was broadly aimed at Thai customers, most of the guests were western and hence maybe the cuisine should be more geared to international tastes.

I also made a huge mistake that was entirely my own fault where I booked the same room multiple times online. They refunded me no problem even though it was months after I booked and was entirely my fault.One important thing to note is that this hotel is kind of out of the way of most tourist-y sights and is not on a metro line. However, we had a blast taking the river taxi down to a more central part of Bangkok and we could then transfer to metro lines, etc. We had a blast.The breakfast, coffees, and everything made by the little cafe attached to the hotel was delicious.

Also, hotel is very organic and tries to encourage people to be environmentally friendly. My biggies thing with the hotel was the rooms, maybe this is a common thing in Bangkok, I am not sure, but the rooms are small and it was hard to sleep at night due to nose. I had 3 nights here and I cant say I had a good night sleep. Dog barking outside for hours one night and the other nights, once they start setting up for breakfast at 6am, it was very hard to sleep in the room. I was on second floor, above the dinning area. And the room is cozy in a rustic way, which means it is a little less convenient, such as no place to store or put your stuff in the bathroom and such.

Location was also good - close to the river ferry - which meant that we could get to the centre of the city and main attractions within 15-30min, it was also easy enough to get taxis. There was nice street food nearby and conveniently located 7/11 shop for all essentials. The hotel had really nice area to sit and have some drinks, the food at the restaurant was really tasty too - i had breakfast one day and it was excellent - they have a bakery on site and providing fresh bread and home main spreads for breakfast every day. Staff were extremely helpful and friendly!","February 3, 2019","23    Phranakorn-Nornlen Hotel

1266,We had a very nice stay. Although we booked 2 nights they just charged us the half price for the second night (we checked out at 8 pm because we had a flight at midnight).The only thing was that we booked this hotel because we were looking for a childfriendly place. But unfortunately there were complains on behalf of the hotel staff when our kids (2 and 4 years old) were playing in the reception area were a little corner with toys for kids is situated. But it's still a nice place and I can recommend it!,"February 3, 2019","23    Phranakorn-Nornlen Hotel

1267,"In reading the reviews I thought that this was a ""nice"" hotel. It is a guest house - not a hotel. There is a big difference. The staff was friendly and accommodating, but the rooms were minimal at best. No closets, bathroom was very basic (no shower stall, no tub), the walls were thin and could have used a good scrub. The breakfast every morning was just OK - eggs, bread, etc. - no fruit, no traditional Thai food. You pay for anything other than water, coffee or water. Laundry service consisted of a single coin operated machine near the lobby and a place to hang-dry your clothes. The location of the hotel is in a residential neighborhood which made for an interesting experience, but many taxi/tuk tuk drivers could not or would not deliver us to the guest house. We did not travel with children, but there were toys out for kids to play with and it looked like a lot of families with small children were in residence. I enjoyed our stay, but, in reading the prior reviews, did not appreciate the difference between a guest house and a hotel until we arrived. In this regard, we were disappointed because it was not as expected. Nonetheless, if you are willing to forego comforts typically associated with a traditional hotel experience, then I recommend the Phranakorn-Norlen.","January 28, 2019","23    Phranakorn-Nornlen Hotel

1268,"This was my first time traveling with my mother and friend to Thailand. Our flight was extremely delayed therefore we arrived 3 AM in the morning. Upon our arrival, you'll feel quite afraid because the entrance is off an alley street. ( Very common.) I asked our driver to wait for us to ensure that we were able to get in, because they closed off their main doors by 10 PM. He got off the van and noticed a side door with a window on the left and called out to the receptionist in front. She came out and opened the door to let us in and proceeded to check in. They have a small elevator to assist with the your luggages.Overall, my experience was beyond my expectations because everyone constantly went above and beyond to accommodate us. My mother got very I'll and we had to cancel our trip to Northern Thailand. They went out of their way to buy food and wrote a list of symtopms on a scratch pad for me to take to the pharmacy to get medication. The staff took turns checking in with my mother to make sure she was fine.I extended my stay and have gotten to know all of their staff, they are now my Thai family and this is my home away from home. I highly recommend this cute boutique hotel if you're not interested in newly fresh paint and marble floors, this is definitely not the Hyatt. If you want to experience the beauty of the local people and what the culture has to offer this will be your extended family home away from home. I rate my entire experience here 20/10.Cheers!","January 25, 2019","23    Phranakorn-Nornlen Hotel

The breakfast was really nice as well as all the people working there. Everybody was nice, polite and helpful!We really recommend the PN hotel for everybody who likes a nice and quite place to chill out and relax in the business of Bangkok. We personally would really like to visit PN hotel once again :) Room:You have to listen to the very nice music CD in the room. The songs are self selected by the hotel.

There is also a laundry service very useful if you’re staying in the country for a few weeks. Breakfast was really good, limited choice but cooked to perfection. Only downside for us was the location.

Bcz of the distance to main road, it’s very quiet location. It seems a local community, as I used to eat around, there are so many street food nearby, and some very nice small restaurants, most of there could not speak English, but all of them are so friendly, and I never get paid higher price I think than locals. In the morning there is morning market nearby the main road, I enjoy finding local food there than eating in hotel even. 711 is also very closed, for me I love to experience local life there. There are many activities in hotel, I missed most of them as my busy schedule. I tried massage there after my busy day, the local therapist is a nice lady, but I don’t really her massage style. Breakfast is nice, I have tried one time, as I love more outside local foods. Room is lovely, little bit old has to say. U will feel so relaxing in this lovely place.

1285,"If you see my other reviews I am capable of fulsome praise and eulogies when, and wherever the customer service/product/catering/amenities warrant it, but this place, CAREFULLY chosen, was no technicolour fireworks, just a very monochrome (like the ceiling of our room: unpainted, unfinished?) damp squib of a grey. Perhaps the hotel should be renamed ‘Tints of Grey’ because it was that, nothing special and actually lots of micro irritations. Here we go:Check in was ok, but we were early so we went away until 2pm. When we came back the friendly receptionist (credit where it is due) Khun Nim,, had gone and another, less friendly receptionist told us we had to wait. Which we did. But while seated in the bar, the girl on duty (who I will come back to) barely registered us, and just curtly addressed us. NEXT. In most hotels a bellboy will offer to take bags to the room: here we did it ourselves. ROOM: oh dear, nothing like the pictures, the ceiling looked like it had just been plastered and the view was hideous, a shanty backs onto the hotel. Never mind. Hopefully there will be other things to console? Large bottled water in room but tea and coffee just the tasteless Nescafé stuff (also in breakfast room, no proper coffee) Curtains didn’t close properly so the sun woke us up every morning, bed covers are two duvets (not one for the whole bed) which was irritating. Bed was reasonably comfortable.Onto breakfast: this wasn’t a great experience: you have one option, and as we are vegetarian we got omelette, but one morning we we told there were no eggs and we would have to have fried rice (with egg) - they could make egg fried rice but no omelette????Surly staff in breakfast room, (Khun Kik) actually spoke roughly to my Thai partner when i wasn’t around and her service only improved when I enquired about the name of the owner. Other miscellaneous annoyances: feral cat in garden (there were a few feral cats in the soi, don’t pet them) a hair found in the breakfast, no warm greetings when we returned, pool looks like a needs a good clean (I told my partner not to swim in it on last night) and finally we had to ask for the freshly brewed coffee/juice. There is a silver lining however, in the most unlikely of places: the housekeeping was top notch (always remembering to change towels) and the shuttle service to the end of the soi was operated by the ever smiling Khun TONG. Perhaps he should give the miserable receptionists and kitchen staff a customer service masterclass.If I managed this hotel, (I have a lot of experience in delivering exceptional customer service) I’d either train or hire new staff because this wasn’t the experience we had been looking forward to, we were glad when we checked out. In fact, we stayed in a hotel in Pattaya a month earlier for half the price but double the service. Time to really think about what you are doing Tints of Blue, we won’t be back, cannot recommend and although you started on day 1 with 4 stars (Khun Nim, Khun Tong) by day 4 you had slipped to 1.

This time, we had done a lot of travelling around Thailand but promised ourselves our last night would be at our favourite Tints of Blue.

The only thing to note is the location - pros are that it is quiet and in a non-touristy area, cons are that it’s hard for taxis to find (down a small alley) and also very far from the main tourist center/attractions. You have to factor in about an hour (or more) on public transit to get to most of the temples, etc. That being said, it’s relatively easy (SkyTrain is a few blocks away), but definitely something to consider if you’re looking to make the most of your time and also if you like to go back to the hotel in the middle of the day (not really possible).","February 21, 2019","24    Tints of Blue Hotel

Breakfast was great, beds were super comfy, room was clean, and staff was excellent! We took the Airport Rail Link and then the Metro to get here from Suvarnabhumi Airport, and while that was straightforward we had trouble navigating to the hotel from the Metro station the first time - so plan accordingly. We used the Metro and BTS a lot during our stay to get to other neighborhoods since we had such easy access to the Sukhumvit (MRT) and Asok (BTS) stations. We ended up booking this hotel again when we had an extra night in Bangkok before our return flight home two weeks later.

1300,"I really dig this hotel. I have stayed here twice for when I go on my visa runs. The rooms are great and have a great style of hotel. The best part is the hotel is off the main road so it is very quiet and peaceful. You have to pay attention to the peace and quiet. Or you wait for their dedicated tuk tuk to pick you up at the main road. Whenever there was anything amiss in my room it was fixed right away. The breakfasts were great and the room they had for eating breakfast in was lovely. Wifi was spot on and always worked and the exercise room on floor 8 worked great for me. I used that room twice. Here is my only complaint. It is a hotel but it does not appear that people are working there like having guests. I know that sounds crazy but they could really work on their hospitality. They seem annoyed often and I could never figure out what that was about. I know customers can be challenging but isn't there that saying, ""the customer is always right."" Or maybe that is just an American saying. Regardless, I would go back because the price is right and basically in general I don't get Bangkok's natives like tourists all that much anyway so it is kind of running theme in bangkok in my experience. The whole Thai SMILE campaign to me seems very untrue, unfortunately. But again, A GREAT HOTEL!time engaging with their guests. It would go along the way. I know customers can be challenging but there is no saying, ""the customer is always right."" Or maybe that is just American saying. Regardless, I would go back because the price is right and generally like everything is a running theme in my experience. The whole Thai SMILE campaign to me seems very untrue, unfortunately.

1301,"Stayed at Tints Of Blue from Oct 6 - 9 Oct. The hotel is located down a narrow alley. It's a small hotel but has a cosy feel away from the hustle and bustle from the city. Room was lovely and each room has a different theme but not sound proof enough. Could hear 'strange' noises from a couple next door in the middle of the night..but luckily, they left the following day.Staff were friendly and breakfast was good. The nice lamps hung all around the cafe created a warm and homely ambience.The tuk tuk service offered was great. It takes you to and fro from hotel to the main rd and back. However, it can be a little bit troublesome to time ourselves on the timing to return to the hotel via the tuk tuk as the pick up time starts at every hour, and I don't think it's safe for ladies to walk back down the alley back to the hotel at night after shopping. Once you miss it, that's it i guess.But overall, we had a pleasnt stay at Tints of Blue and would recommend it to anyone who wants some peace and quiet and a relaxing time in BKK.","October 14, 2018","24    Tints of Blue Hotel

1303,"This place is SUPER cute (gorgeous design and decor!) and I will definitely visit again! Location is great - tucked up the end of a soi - so quiet, but still with great access to Sukhumvit Rd and the BTS. It's an easy 5 minute walk out to the main road, or the hotel offers a free shuttle out.My friend and I scored a studio room which was fantastic - great space and layout. The beds were SUPER soft and facilities great. One small downside was some noise from the hall (doors to other rooms opening and closing) and from pipes (a gurgling sound in the wall when the shower was on), but it wasn't constant and didn't really bother us.Breakfast was great. Main meal made to order (either the Thai special of the day, or eggs and sides) with a buffet of breads, fruits, yogurt, condiments, etc. The dining area is really cute, a great space to chill and chat in amongst greenery; and the service was great. Rooftop pool is small and narrow but adequate with a view over the city. Lots of spaces to lounge and greenery to break up the BKK concrete jungle.Highly recommend. I live in Chiang Mai and am often in Bangkok for weekend breaks. This is definitely going to be my new go-to for accommodation.","September 16, 2018","24    Tints of Blue Hotel

Tuk Tuk was sent to the main street to collect me during a rain storm. Check in and out were seamless.

Ridiculously comfortable beds, tasteful/artsy decor (reminds me a bit of Lisbon, Portugal), good breakfast, lovely staff, very clean, great rain shower.I stayed in the Deluxe studio which is more spacious than the standard room. It had a kitchenette (with a mini stove haha) and alot of natural light. Although it's about a 4-5 minute walk from Sukhumvit road, they provide you with an hourly pick up from the main road to the hotel by tuktuk, and a drop off to the main road whenever you want as well.10 minute walk to Asok metro station.10 minute walk to the Westin hotel (just as a reference point).10 minute walk to Terminal 21 mall.7 minute walk to nearest convenient store and pharmacy. I recommend you download an app called Grab to order scooters/cabs as it's 30-50% less expensive than any other taxi or scooter transport in the area. ","July 9, 2018","24    Tints of Blue Hotel

Thankfully, we weren't holed up in the room all day but it was like cutting teeth trying to stay on for longer than 5 minutes, without getting bounced off.On a lighter note, loved the food, decor, rooms (even though the floor was a tad grubby) views and the fact that it is nicely tucked away from Bangkok's madness.

It's a quiet place that is tricky to reach by taxi since the alley is narrow and probably was not meant for cars (our taxi got stuck when there was 2 way traffic). Thanks to the tuktuk service offered by the hotel it is easy to get to the sky train and subway.

Juice they offered was not really perfect to European taste.Swimming pool area needs a maintenance and the bed in the room was hard alike the rock. Small carden downstairs was nice but especially in the evening time full of mosquitos.We stayed 4 nights and happily found a perfect hotel for a longer stay in Rayong.

The added bonus of having a tuk tuk to take you from the hotel to the main road was a welcome addition as it's a bit of a walk. The staff were wonderful and very helpful. The room was spacious and airy. The rooftop pool, while not the most glamours of the hotels we looked, was lovely.

1321,"I recently spent a week in this charming hotel. It is a 3 - star hotel so do not expect luxury. What you get is a comfortable, gemütlich ( for lack of an accurate English equivalent) and peaceful stay in this bustling city.Some outstanding features:* Friendly and helpful reception and restaurant staff with a workable knowledge of English. You are provided with an informative map of the area, transport lines and restaurants.* Perfect location at the end of a leafy side street ( hence no traffic noise ) off the main road ( Sukhumvit ). This 8 storey hotel is fortunately not dwarfed by the growing number of high rise buildings that tend to disfigure Bangkok. Walking to the main road will take all of six minutes. Another 6 minutes and you reach the MRT and BTS stations. Airport Railink to Makassan plus Petchburi MRT to Sukhumvit station should not take more than 40 minutes. So no airport taxi needed if you travel light !* Hotel provides free tuk tuk to Sukhumvit road, if you do not feel like walking. Outgoing service anytime on request and incoming every hour on the hour at the corner on the main road (until 10 p.m.). You will be driven by their friendly and jovial driver.* Although tiny, the roof-top pool provides the chance of a refreshing dip. You can lounge on the sun deck or sit in the shade of the pergolas in this pleasant roof-garden. All around open views of this residential side of Sukhumvit.* Although breakfast choice is limited, you still can choose between Western ( eggs any way you like, with bacon, salad or beans), homemade jams, butter, toast, cereals, yoghurt) or Thai breakfast ( different each day). Fresh fruit and juice is available as well as rather curious desserts. All in all, breakfast on the patio amidst exotic plants is a calm pleasure.* Very good WiFi ( free ) throughout the hotel. * My deluxe room (7th floor) was basic but tastefully decorated, in keeping with the overall blue theme of the hotel. Comfortable bed, fine TV set with enough foreign language channels, calm and spotlessly clean room overlooking a luxuriant green plot of land. * Electric kettle and complimentary tea and coffee bags.* The room includes a well equipped kitchen and a small balconyA few minor inconveniences: dim lights, no direct telephone line, no cupboard just a rack to hang clothes and two open shelves,. So hardly any storage space.One major inconvenience though. No hot water in the bathroom (or kitchen ) sink. If one is used to shaving with hot water one needs to boil water in the kettle or else shuttle between the hot water shower and the bathroom mirror. Watch out for bruises !Notwithstanding the above, I enjoyed my stay in Tints of Blue and would be happy to return.","March 5, 2018","24    Tints of Blue Hotel

Breakfast was the only negative about the hotel but that could just be down to me as I’m a slightly fussy eater. Would recommend.","November 22, 2017","24    Tints of Blue Hotel

1335,"We came here due to the positive reviews on TA & were not disappointed. Rooms were comfortable & rather spacious, there's a rain shower in the bathroom. If you would like to do some minor cooking, there's a stove & a fridge in the room, but hardly necessary since there's plenty to eat in the neighborhood.  Breakfast was great! You can choose from Thai style & western style or both! There's also bread, yogurt, cereals, fruits available if you can finish all of it! Quality was great! Though check out is at 12pm, you can store the luggage at the hotel & have a shower later at the roof garden where the pool is situated at.  The hotel provides a free tuk tuk shuttle service to the entrance of sukhumvit soi 27 (otherwise a 10 min walk in), this is a 5-7 min walk from the Sukhumvit MRT or Asoke bts station.  For departure from the hotel to soi 27 entrance, it's anytime between 0700-2200; for pick up from soi 27 entrance to hotel, it's hourly departure with 1st pick up at 0700, last pick up at 2200.","November 21, 2017","24    Tints of Blue Hotel

1336,I spent six night over two visits at this place. I really like the friendly atmosphere. The rooms are not huge if you compare them to other Bangkok hotels. But they are big enough. The gym on the top floor is also small but you can easy have a 40min workout. The staff is very helpful and very sweet. I will be back. ,"November 14, 2017","24    Tints of Blue Hotel

1337,Stayed at the Tints of Blue hotel for four nights. The hotel itself is about a 10 to 15mins walk to Asok BTS or Sukhumvit mrt but there is a free tuk tuk service from the hotel to the main road which would cut down your walking time to five mins. The tuk tuk service back to the hotel runs hourly till 10pm only. The hotel itself is located at the dead end of a quiet lane which is quite well lighted by Bangkok’s standard. The room itself was nice and the beds were comfortable with soft fluffy pillows which was very welcome after a long day of walking and shopping. Breakfast was a simple affair with either omelet or scrambled eggs with salad and bacon. Otherwise you can check out the special of the day. I would consider staying here again despite the distance to the bts and mrt.,"November 6, 2017","24    Tints of Blue Hotel

Sukhumvit Soi 11 is also a very busy street with 2 other clubs (Levels and Insanity) located on it.- Staff who were very friendly and helpful. I would like to thank Nutty, Wilson, Army, Salah and Bella for all their help during my stay.- Located near Nana BTS station (5 minute walk).What I did not like:- Leaking air-conditioner. On the first day of my stay I came back to my room and found a small puddle on the floor. Props to Nutty for resolving this issue once I informed her about it the next morning. After it was serviced, the air-conditioner still did discharge some random drops of water once in a while.- Low water pressure in the shower which resulted in inconsistent water temperatures.The hotel really needs to look into this.Summary:A nice hotel in a convenient location with wonderful staff.

Especially Bella, Wilson, Arm, Sarah Chalee are respectful and excellent staffs who were ready to respond to the traveller's with smiling face all the time day and night.

1387,"My husband and I spent 3 nights here in April.Best about this hotel is their breakfast. So many options and everything was delicious! The staff was friendly.Our room was on the smaller side but had everything that we needed and was clean.The only real ""con"" for us was that the walls were thin so we could hear everything happening in the other room. And we could also hear people yelling on the streets so perhaps more insulation would be needed for the windows. This woke us up one night and we were on the 6th floor. We thought our windows were open until we checked and realized that they were not. Also, it seemed as though cigarette smoke from another room was entering our room.Other than the points mentioned above, no real complaints. We'd recommend this hotel.","May 20, 2019","25    Salil Hotel Sukhumvit Soi 11

There is an adequate plunge pool on the roof which is very welcome after a long day wandering around the city. The location is convenient close to BTS and MRT. The staff are very helpful and go out of their way to assist in any way they can. My only criticism is unlike all the other hotels in the vicinity they do not provide a tuk tuk service to transport residents to the end of the busy Soi.","January 16, 2019","26    Maitria Hotel Sukhumvit 18 Bangkok - A Chatriu...

Grand Deluxe room is pretty big and even have a large kitchen, which to be honest isn’t necessary because restaurants in the same street are nice and cheap. Bathroom is clean and well maintained, bed is comfy. Breakfast is partly a’la carte (provided by Coffee Club). Better than a basic buffet but still after few days, starts to be boring. Receptionist Ann & Chan was friendly and helpful. We could manage easily to have late checkout (6pm). Nothing to complain about, except the pool area which is great but pretty small (although wasn’t busy when we stayed here).","January 13, 2019","26    Maitria Hotel Sukhumvit 18 Bangkok - A Chatriu...

1429,"Location is about 10 minutes walk from Asoke BTS / Sukhumvit MRT. Depends on what your itinerary is within Bangkok, this can be a very convenient place. Not much street food stalls around the street however, there are quite a few restaurants and cafes in front of the hotel and within 2-5 mins walk.The hotel itself is well maintained. The room I stayed was clean and equipped with small kitchenette/sink area, microwave, big fridge, crockery and cutlery - which was really handy when bringing all the wonderful food back to room to enjoy. This was one of the main reasons I chose this hotel! The only essential things that were missing from the kitchen were dishwashing liquid, sponge and kitchen cloth. One can easily buy these at the local 7-11 or supermarket, however probably a bit of a waste especially if one only stays for 1-2 days. The bed was comfortable and fitted with good quality linen. Housekeeping did great job servicing the room everyday. The hotel was also quite enviromentally focused with 'sheet change' card available to be placed on bed if requires sheet change. (To all guests, it would be really beneficial in contributing to the environment to request the bed-linen not to be changed daily especially if they are still very clean after one night.) The standard room itself was spacious enough, equipped with a single and a 2-seater couches. All clean and no marks. Wardrobes had ample space. Bathroom was clean and well-designed. The only small issue I had was the really strong chemical smell when we first entered the room. Not sure if it was their deodoriser or cleaning chemical. After leaving the air-con on for few hours and spraying our own 'natural' room spray, the chemical odour dissipated. The room that I got was on 2nd floor facing neighbour's terraces and despites the huge windows with additional day-light sheer curtain, it was almost impossible to open the curtain as the proximity of the neighbour's terraces was too close and the sheer curtain would not be able to block the visibility from neighbour to our room. Basically it was like staying in a no-window room and could be quite depressing for some.Huge washing machines and dryers are located in the basement. Coins need to be purchased at reception at 75 Baht for each washing machine and dryer. Swimming pool was small but well-designed. Staff were very friendly, professional and displayed the typical 'thai hospitality' warmness. There are a couple of really good professional massage places across the hotel on the same street. They are the ones with wooden/traditional entrance design, NOT the ones with staff sitting outside calling out for customers to come in. There are also a couple of upmarket thai spas on Sukhumvit road as one walks down to Phrom Phong BTS on the hotel.","January 9, 2019","26    Maitria Hotel Sukhumvit 18 Bangkok - A Chatriu...

TripAdvisor recommendations but we had already planned our four days prior to arrival. We used the washing machine and dryer but didn’t do any cooking as just down the road there were some really good roadside stalls and also a few restaurants in very close proximity. They had a coffee club but we never got around to going there. Close to use both types of trains. Supermarket and shopping centre close by as well. Lots of massage shops at end of street also.

The free breakfast was a big drawing point for us and we were disappointed, having to seek elsewhere for our meals. I've stayed in many guesthouses and hostels in SEA before and received much better food offerings than this. ","July 4, 2017","27    Samsen Sam Place

1473,"We arrived at Sam Sen Sam with high expectations due to other reviews on TripAdvisor and other hostel booking sites online and were more than happy with what we got!We arrived to a warm welcome from a smiley lady behind the counter who informed us of the wifi code, where breakfast would be served and where the communal areas were. However, she also asked with a cheeky smile whether we wanted air conditioning in our room for an extra 200baht (around £4.50). We arrived very hot and sweaty due to walking from our hostel on Khao San Road (Only a 10-15 minute walk) with our backpacks on in the midday sun. We were under the impression that air conditioning came with the room, as it was one of the features that prompted us to book. We reluctantly agreed to pay the extra 200 but were aware that it was necessary in the heat of Bangkok!The location is great, only a ten minute walk or 5 minute tuk tuk to Khao San Road and is a peaceful retreat in comparison to the madness of Khao San Road!The room itself was quaint, smallish and cosy. The air conditioning kept the room at a comfortable temperature and was in a row of fiver other double rooms with a bathroom and shower facility at the end of the corridor. The loos and showers were clean and secure and the sinks were nearer the rooms in the corridor. The bed was comfortable and again clean! We also received towels, disposable toothbrushes and soap for our stay.Breakfast was two slices of toast with butter and jam along with a yoghurt and tea or coffee, made to order, which was a nice touch. We ate breakfast in a courtyard area but there was also a comfortable indoor area available to eat breakfast or just hang out.The wifi access was good but unfortunately during our stay there was a mild thunderstorm which restricted our wifi access, although this is of course not Sam Sen Sams fault!!It was quiet when we arrived with not many other travellers staying, that we saw and we were more than comfortable relaxing in the communal area listening and watching (its covered, with an open view to outside) the storm!!The staff and, we assume, family were all so friendly and smiley and they made us feel completely at home!Thank you Sam Sen Sam!","September 9, 2016","27    Samsen Sam Place

I recall looking at the Trip Advisor sticker in the lobby and thinking, ""These guys wouldn't screw me."" Well, my ticket to Siem Reap only got me within a few kilometers of the border on the Thai side, where the driver quickly disappeared and left us with a group of friendly guys intent on getting us to hand them twice the Cambodian visa rate along with our passports.

The sounds of sawing, hammering and work chatter goes on until at least 6pm. You also have the sounds of people as they walk above you. I found atmosphere down there is pretty depressing and grim. Not much natural light can come in since you have to close the curtains if you don't want the work crew peering into your space. In that area they have shared bathroom facilities which are clean, with good hot water heaters, and good water pressure and good wifi reception. Unless the price came down significantly I would not stay in these rooms again. On the other hand they have a number of other rooms upstairs, much nicer and more expensive and those were fully booked at this time. Some with well polished wood floors, all very clean, and there is a pretty sitting area so the atmosphere and general ambience is very pleasant.

But now there is construction of a new building out back and the cheap fan rooms reverberate with loud hammers, metal saws, and shouting ALL day. Dont plan on peace in the back rooms for at least a year.It's true the rooms are so un-soundproof too, so that you can hear whispers in the next room. The cleaning ladies start cleaning things outside at 6am, while talking on their phones, so be ready to be woken up.The daytime lady at the desk can be mean- she yelled at me because I ordered two eggs and she thought two orders of eggs. Sorry for the musinderstanding. But do you have to be rude? The owner is a nice lady with a nice dog, but she's not around much.We also bought a mini-van ticket from here to Angkor Wat which turned out to be one of those infamous visa scams where you are extorted near the border into buying a visa or get stranded. Why would Samsensam want to profit off this terrible scam?The location though is good for being close to the river boat, buses, local park, and lots of cheap food. But we stayed at the Nakorn Ping down the street and got a private bathroom, cheaper room, and finally some quiet.Breakfast sucks.

I have no intention to lug our luggage all the way to Myanmar so we seek permission from Novotel Silom to safekeep our luggages till we check in.Ms Tidee happily agreed and thus gave us an impression of a fine hospitality.After we checked in smoothly on 27 June 2019, we are happy to receive our clean room .We are really very fortunate to have Ms.Tidee to handle us cos she is staff which always carry a smile and an interest to assist. Indirectly silently she is telling me ""nothing is impossible"" in order to assist guests for their best satisfaction and comfort.Thank you very much for decorated up my room and gave me a birthday cake. We love the cake and the kind thought. She is a added STAR for Novotel Silom. So if Novotel Silom is a 4 stars Hotel, it has automatically promoted to 5 Stars as far as I am concern.

I read a lot of complaints online about the rooms' age but they looked fine. They were clean and spacious. The bed was so comfy. My only complaint was the room needed more electrical outlets and lights (a bit on the dark side) Had breakfast there for 3 days and I was pleased with the selection. Accor never disappoints.

1512,"We had booked two rooms for 3 nights from June 11. Booking was done not through any travel site but directly with the hotel website. We arrived at BKK from an international flight and arrived at the check-in desk at 11:15 AM. We were greeted by a polite but not particularly warm receptionist. She informed us since we arrived a couple of hours early and hence we will have to wait for 3 hours till their check-in starts.I am not exactly a globe trotter, but having traveled to many locations like Maldives, Ubud, Darjeeling, Jaisalmer, US, etc over the last two decades have given me a fair idea of what hotel service is and should be like.Never in my past experience has the hotel staff made me wait for 3 hours without even offering water. Now in all fairness, I should have informed the hotel in advance that I'd be arriving a couple of hours early than their scheduled check-in time. So yes technically they were right to make us wait. But then again, it was just a couple of hours and from where I come from customer service is everything. We even requested them to let us check in by 1:30 PM but they did not entertain us. They literally made us wait exactly till 2:00 PM (not a minute early). We go the keys at 2:04 PM in our hands. This was particularly worse because I was traveling with my 6-year-old child and my parents who are in their late 60's. We had a just endured two 4 hour flights (almost 12 hour travel time considering transit times, etc) and were really tired. Later on, when I saw so many rooms empty on our 17th floor (June being offseason), it made me even sadder.Among other things, the toilet in one of the rooms did not flush and they had to call a technician to fix it. The closet door (weighing almost 20 kg) in the room just fell off while opening as the hinge screws were loose. It didn’t hurt anyone but it was scary. We called the hotel service and they promptly fixed the door but never cared to ask us if anyone got hurt. Among the good things, the rooms were mostly clean, location is good, food is average, value for money is average.","July 2, 2019","28    Novotel Bangkok Silom Road (Formerly Novotel B...

Water in the shower room tends to stay in the middle and you need to kick the water to the drainage to drain all the water. 4.

1525,"First time I stayed at Novotel Silom and I’m very pleased that I chose that hotel. The reason why I picked this hotel is a combination of location, price and value. Who likes to be around Silom, Sathorn and the river area should stay there. Also the price and value is one of the best. It’s a good middle class hotel. Not a cheap product but also not high end. Khun Tidee and her reception team took special care of me. Even tho it was my very first time, they gave me the feeling that everyone knows me and treated me well. I’m returning in one week and I know that Khun Tidee will prepare everything for me so I feel like home. I’m a big fan of sharing my good experiences but I’m also not afraid to share what’s not so good. The room I stayed had some minor “beauty marks” but not a big deal so I didn’t want to change the room. The biggest issue was the gym. 3 out of 4 cardio machines were broken but I’m sure they will fix it soon. ","June 13, 2019","28    Novotel Bangkok Silom Road (Formerly Novotel B...

If we needed anything, we only had to ask. Nothing was too big a problem for these ladies. We would like to offer a very big thank you to them. In fact, it was because of the way Tidee helped me on so many occasions and her happy personality with willingness to help in any way possible, that we have decided to return and stay here for a few extra weeks after we return from Phuket. As for the amenities,, The rooms are fresh and modern and very clean and, don't have that musky smell often found in Asian hotel rooms. The housekeeping staff do a wonderful job and should be acknowledged too.The breakfast has a good mix of Asian and western foods whilst the buffet dinner is money well spent. All the seafood we could eat for a reasonable cost.We will be returning here each time we come to Bangkok.

Tuk tuk's are available to navigate you through the traffic congestion during peak hours. We had a spacious, comfortable room on a higher level with a city view. Their facilities include a concierge, buffet breakfast restaurant, swimming pool, fitness centre. The most unique and valuable added touch was a complimentary “I phone” to provide communication, & mobile internet access to maps, and attraction information while exploring the city.

1541,I decided to stay here due to location and it did not disappoint. Walking distance to boat stop and close to toll for when u need a taxi. Lobby has a cheap feel to it. Bathroom with urine smell and needs upgrade. Free Mobile with data in room that u take out and use when u are out and about. I believe u can also make calls but did not use that option (not sure). “Concierge” was no help. Pretty much yes/no answers. ,"April 29, 2019","28    Novotel Bangkok Silom Road (Formerly Novotel B...

Rooms were a decent size and air con worked well Beds were also very comfortable. The breakfast was amazing and we were taken aback from the amount of choice. The bar wasn't up to much but I guess it would be fine if you weren't looking for a banging night out. The location was ok, about 10 minutes walk from train station which allowed us to make our way about the city without being detoured by tuk tuk drivers and not to mention, cheap. The area itself is fairly quiet, few shops and cafes. For the real nightlife experience you need to travel but we didn't mind as most cities are like that anyway and it also meant we weren't right in the middle of the hustle and bustle. So all in all, we had no issues and everything was positive so 5 stars for the stay. Thanks for the pleasant stay.","April 24, 2019","28    Novotel Bangkok Silom Road (Formerly Novotel B...

I have never had a hotel experience like this in my life, and would recommended this hotel to anyone staying in the area. This employee in particular, Tangins, was by the far the nicest and most honest hotel employee I have ever encountered in all my business trips to Bangkok.

They had large lockers that fit my 65 L backpack with plenty of room. The bathrooms on the 4th floor (where the showers are located) are some of the nicest & biggest bathrooms I’ve seen at a hostel. They come equip with large mirrors, shampoo, body wash & hair dryers. The hostel is social, people always lounging on the bean bags or sitting downstairs. It’s easy to meet people but not at all a party hostel. We loved the area we were in! It was one block away from the BTS train station that links you to where ever you need to go.

There is not really a vibe there though, so if you are looking for a less commercialized place to make new contacts that’s not the place. The staff was really helpful, especially Tom helped a lot. Only exception is the staff member called Phen. She was very arrogant in her replies. I asked her about the water festival dates and as our informations didn’t match up she was starting to give bad looks and be annoyed about me asking. When I asked another staff she was next by and said „I already told you when it is“. Long story short, she was not even right. I went to Khao San Road a day before she told me and enjoyed the water festival.

Beds are large and have space within bunk to place bag, etc... in addition to the lockers. Showers clean with plenty of hot water on demand. I would say location is convenient, depending on what you are looking for. It is a 5 minute walk or less to the Skytrain/Metro system which will allow you access to most of the city including airport, Sukhumvit, or even the historic core. To get to the historic downtown (Palace, Was Arun, Wat Pho, etc.) I think there were two decent public transport options. First, take trains to the Central Pier and then the ferry on the Chao Praya River to the sites OR make your way to the Khlong Saen Saeb (~20 minutes) and catch the very interesting boat ride down towards the historic core. If you're looking for a bit of a ""western"" break from Thai culture, there are two huge malls really close by with great food courts, the most amazing movie theaters, and SE Asia's largest (?) aquarium. The Red Sky Bar is also not too far away. For me, who was not looking for the youth, party atmosphere of Khao San Road, this was a great location.","January 10, 2019","29    Bed Station Hostel

The staff mostly hang out on their own and keep away from guests unless approached. While this hostel was supposed to be friendly for solo travelers, because of the boring atmosphere there is no interaction between guests. There was only one fun night when they organized a pool party. But unless you're lucky that something is organized on your night, well you're pretty much on your own.

1576,"One of the best hostels to stay in. Rooms and bathrooms are very clean, I have my own sheets but never used them. Air conditioning is very good, and runs throughout the hotel. The dining area and mezzanine above are a great place to relax and socialize.I stayed in a 8 bed mix on 2nd floor for 3 nights. Everyone was very quiet and lights were off by 9pm. The only small complaint I have is the door mechanism, which has a loud locking sound after the door shuts, which can potentially wake you in the middle of the night. I wud also find a way to keep the aircon running 24/7 for otherwise the room can get stuffy, so if you're travelling with friends, get one of them to leave a card in the card slot so aircon keeps running while you're away.To the south you have MBK center (lots of food on 6th floor), which is a 15min walk away (or take the skyrail, just 1 stop). You can have breakfast at McDonald's (open 7am) near the National Stadium BTS Silom Line, but there are plenty of places around the hostel too.The hostel is a bit far from the major tourist attractions to the west. the cheapest way is to go by bus, which is around THB10, though rail is a lot faster and times more reliable but does cost several times more. Problem with Bangkok is that there is no single all-in-one card you can use for bus, metro, skyrail, boat etc; they all have different ticket systems, so you'll just have to line up for tickets everytime you go somewhere.If you're coming in from Don Mueang Airport, take the A1 Bus (ask at airport info desk; not whatever google maps tell you); it will take you straight into the city without stops (takes 15 min). Bus will stop at Mo Chit, then just take the skyrail to Ratchathewi.","December 11, 2018","29    Bed Station Hostel

1582,"I'm not usually one to stay in hostels, due to a few bad experiences but as we were five travelling, we thought we would give the bed station a go because of the excellent reviews. five of us took a six person Dorm and had one other man in there too - so we were a full room, however it worked just fine.The beds and room are incredibly clean, the set up and use of space is great.I liked that there were lockers + space at the end of your bed to store a few key things, the blind set up was fantastic, it blocked the light and allowed that extra privacy. The wifi was good and the communal space was cool. I loved the games that were available, it definitely created a good atmosphere. The staff were friendly and helpful. Breakfast was basic and we chose to eat elsewhere, but what do you expect for free breaky?Would stay again if back in BangkokAlso, handy tip - the local food stalls at the entrance of the street were great and they delivered too! Nice local family making great pad Thai :) Thanks Bed Station","November 12, 2018","29    Bed Station Hostel

1583,"It been one of my favorite hostels. It is clean, spacious, and safe. I liked their lounge areas. You can use the communal table or sit on a bean bag. It's good for people who want to socialize or do their own thing. Also, staff is so AWESOME! Friendly, fun, outgoing, cheerful, attentive. Night activities we're also fun.

1584,"I stayed in this hostel for 1 night in January 2018 while on a short layover in Thailand. The hostel itself is quite nice, with clean rooms and bathrooms. The check-in process was smooth, and the gentleman at the reception was quite nice to talk to and get some ideas of places to goto in the city. From a location perspective, the hostel is near a metro station, so connectivity is not a problem. But its very easy to get lost the first time you go there (despite directions online), as its in an unmarked alley. So take this into account while planning your trip. There are plenty of other hostels also in the neighborhood, if you want to explore alternatives..The hostel has a nice common eating area and a bar, which is great for socializing. I met plenty of people while having a bite to eat and it was great to exchange stories about our travels around SE Asia. The hostel had decent Wi-Fi and this was accessible in my dormitory room as well.Overall, I would recommend this place as an excellent value for money hostel, particularly suitable for a brief stopover.","October 21, 2018","29    Bed Station Hostel

The sleeping dorms are really comfortable and you have quiet a lot of privacy due to the set up. The sanitary facilities are very clean and well equipped.

The beds were PERFECT and had everything that I needed. I felt like I was in my own little hobbit hole and everything felt incredibly private for me. I loved that I had a curtain that I could close if I wanted to sleep early or get some alone time. The common area was great, breakfast area was great. And you can walk to one of the world's largest malls in no time at all.This place is tucked back in the buildings so you have to keep a keen eye when finding it.

The staff were the best part about staying here, super helpful and accommodating. The hostel was very clean, great design and style and comfortable beds.

Very nice location, really close to the sky train, grocery store and street food spots. Non-stop social activity and young people in the hostel. The biggest plus for us was the good hygiene. The staff was constantly cleaning, the rooms were spotless, the sanitary well maintained and the sheets were clean. If we had to give any remarks, it would be the noise at night. But you should be comprehensive about this if you choose for a hostel. Thank you for the good experience, Emiel & Benedicte","September 5, 2018","29    Bed Station Hostel

1599,"Highly recommended! I've stayed now quite a few times at BedStation and never was I disappointed! The staff is extremely friendly and always ready to help you - Breakfast and free WiFi are included - The common areas, rooms are comfortable and clean including the toilet! What makes this place even better is the great location near the Train service BTS! Maybe only 200m from the Hostel, you can take the train to almost anywhere in Bangkok, which makes sightseeing extremely easy & comfortable! Just ask the staff if you would like to get any recommendations for you planned day activities! Besides that, they also recently started almost weekly activities where we could join with other guests and the staff. When I was there, I was able to join the cooking class to learn how to cook a traditional Thai dish taught by the friendly staff! I also saw that they planned to go out on a bicycle trip but sadly I could not join! Maybe next time! Overall, this place is great if you are looking for a cozy, friendly hostel within the buzzling city center of Bangkok! By the way, they have a hostel cat - make sure to play with her!","August 6, 2018","29    Bed Station Hostel

During my travels in Bangkok, I rented a lock with a deposit fee from the Bed Station Hostel. After locking up my possessions conveniently my Bose head silencer headphones were stolen from my locker. I do think it's fishy that the only other person that has access to the lock was the hostel staff. They were less than accommodating after the news of my headphones had ""gone missing"" from my locked locker.
