0,"Just returned from a fabulous stay at the Crowne Plaza Barcelona during Barcelona Pride.The hotel itself is very central, close to the Plaza de España - two metro stations just a short walk away.The hotel itself is very modern with the focal point being the stunning rooftop pool/bar terrace. Views of the city from the rooftop were incredible. Such a lovely chilled experience.Firstly I just want to congratulate the management team. Every staff member in the hotel was wonderful, so friendly and accommodating and couldn’t do enough constantly making sure our stay was a memorable one. All our special requests were noted and we were really made to feel welcome.The room was very spacious with a great view - I would definitely recommend requesting a high floor if you do book.Beds were very comfy, bathroom a really decent size with great amenities (bath robes, pillow menu etc).Had a lovely stay, it’s a really wonderful property and would rebook without hesitation if I ever return to Barcelona.Thanks so much for such a fabulous stay :)","July 10, 2019","0    Crowne Plaza Barcelona - Fira Center

1,"Excellent location, only a few minute walk from the magic fountains. My family and I chose to take the hop on hop off tour for 2 days and the bus stop was very conveniently located down the street from the hotel. The rooms are MASSIVE!!! Not quite sure why hotels in Spain do not allow you to have 4 people in a room. I'm not at all comfortable with leaving my pre-teens in their own room. In North America, you would never find this. Nevertheless, the rooms again, are HUGE and can definitely accommodate 4 people. The swimming pool was not a ""pool"" according to North American standards. I would classify it as an aquarium for adults to sit and relax in. Beautiful view from the rooftop...if you have some time to relax, definitely go to the top, grab a drink and enjoy the view of Barcelona. All in all, fantastic hotel...pricey for sure, but well worth it!","July 2, 2019","0    Crowne Plaza Barcelona - Fira Center

5,"We stayed at the excellent Crowne Plaza fira centre from 26th May to 1st June 2019 and from the very start, we knew we had chosen the right hotel.All the staff were very welcoming, we had booked a club room and were escorted to the Club Lounge to check in, while the staff member offered us an array of drinks and we settled on a very nice glass of champagne.Check in was seamless with the very helpful Cansin, who was very polite, helpful and informative. Cansin and Marc and all the staff were great.We have stayed in many different hotels with Club or Executive lounges and this is definitely one of the good ones! Juices and alcohol, including champagne all available from 7 am till 11 pm, along with light bites at various intervals.Breakfast is quite a feast, lots of choice and plenty of it.The hotel is well situated for sightseeing, very close to the Magic Fountain and the old Bull Ring, where there are lots of great restaurants, and easy access to the hop on-hop off buses.Up at the roof bar & pool area, all the staff gave a great service, Dinesh, always with a smile and Jordi went out of his way to give a great service, both remembering our drinks. We had a great evening meal just before it got dark, great views, made even better as night fell and area's lit up.The Crowne Plaza is excellent value in a great location, we would highly recommend it and would definitely stay again,","June 8, 2019","0    Crowne Plaza Barcelona - Fira Center

6,"I stayed at the end of May at this hotel and I think it is one of the best Crowne Plaza (I stayed on various CP and other hotels from IHG ).Even though my reservation was with Reward Nights, I was upgraded to a larger room with access to the Club Lounge , because I am a Spire Elite member. In the Club Lounge I enjoyed an excellent breakfast , drinks, and different tapas during the day . The staff was very nice and helpful, from the beginning til the end of my stay. The room was excellent, with a big and very comfortable bed. The rooftop has a nice pool and a bar where you can have a drink/ meal with a great view over Barcelona.I will definitely come back to this hotel during my next vacation.

7,"First time to Barcelona and loved it. A hip, clean, laid back city. Stayed at the Crowne Plaza and loved it. Great location. Easy to get in and out of. Hotel and staff are TOPS..they greeted us when we got there. Were friendly and polite. Never had any issues they could not solve. Hotel is modern, clean and very relaxing. The rooftop bar was our favourite. With the bar/restaurant as well as pool topside, it was the perfect place to watch the sun go down and see the city come alive.","June 1, 2019","0    Crowne Plaza Barcelona - Fira Center

8,"So were touring Europe with a South Korean KPop band and we land here for the last gig. A wonderful hotel with amazing facilities, including a rooftop bar and pool. This is where they missed a too score for the coffers. We finished our show at the Palau Sant Jordi and the load out was done by 0200 hours, at this point at least120 hungry and very thirsty roadys get back to the hotel wanting copious amounts of alchohol and nibbles. The hotel staff wouldnt open the roof bar, or any bar for that matter, and consequenlty the hitel missed out on about £3000 worth of business (we can drink a lot after a last show). Great hotel and location though, great rooms and staff.","May 30, 2019","0    Crowne Plaza Barcelona - Fira Center

9,This has to be one of the best Crowne Plaza hotels for service globally. Such a warm welcome and impeccable service from start to finish. We were lucky enough to be upgraded to use the club lounge which served breakfast then food and drinks (including Champagne) through to 11pm. The room was great and the rooftop bar with outdoor pool and wonderful view over the city just made it. Would recommend anyone visiting Barcelona to stay here.,"May 27, 2019","0    Crowne Plaza Barcelona - Fira Center

10,I was lucky that the conference was attending was at this hotel - it’s well set up for business but enjoyable for leisure too.I had a club room which was Huge albeit very dark. It had a balcony but you would never use it as it was always in the shade.The bed was very comfy. Fluffy towels. Large shower cubicle. Free WiFi. Nespresso maker in the room. Good amount of power and computer jack slots.Breakfast had a good spread but quite average.Club room a little soulless and food in the evenings somewhat scant and boring.Roof top pool small but great for a dip - there is a full pool and spa for a proper swim. Had a delicious pulpo in the roof top restaurant.Reception could be very busy and often a wait - but staff gracious and helpful.Would come back when next in Barcelona.,"May 22, 2019","0    Crowne Plaza Barcelona - Fira Center

11,"The hotel is ~25 minutes from the airport costing around €30 by taxi. It is a quick taxi ride to downtown Barcelona, but we chose to walk, which takes 30 minutes at a moderately fast pace. On arrival as we had booked Club level rooms we were taken up to the Club Lounge, where we were immediately offered a drink and the check-in was very smooth.We had a suite. The bathroom had doors from both the sitting room and the bedroom. The room was very clean. The bed was king size and extremely comfortable with plenty of pillows. Some of the cupboard storage was in the sitting room. There is a decent size safe big enough for a 15 inch screen laptop.The Club Lounge was well worth the extra money. Breakfast, whilst the same each day, had a good range of hot and cold food. Drinks (both soft and alcoholic) were available throughout the day, including Moet et Chandon, spirits, soft drinks, tea and coffee. At lunch/evening there was a small buffet of mostly cold foods,which were different each night.There were minor problems with the rooms which we reported and none of them were really resolved - noisy aircon, a non-functioning razor socket, milk and face cloths not being replenished, the wastepaper bin not being emptied. Nothing disastrous or inconvenient, but it suggests that the systems and processes the hotel use are not quite where they should be for room cleaning and maintenance. Irritating.Overall a very good stay and the minor niggles would not put us off staying there again.","May 19, 2019","0    Crowne Plaza Barcelona - Fira Center

12,"I stayed there with my partner on my second visit to Barcelona, this hotel was my second choice as the first was not available. My hopes were high due to its standard. we made requests in advance and were assured via email to be accommodated accordingly, guess what when we arrived after all that tiring flights and trains a very very slow moving reception welcomed us. After a long while its our turn and we found out that she was just reading what we requested and made calls to relevant staff to get the room ready although the room was free as guest already had checked out. Now She told us one hour to wait in the lobby until the room is clean and ready to go. After completing full one hour we went to reception and reminded them about us, then started the procedure of check in another 15 mins and we finally got the key. We were given a nice room okay i am happy about that. later that night TV remote stopped working, we requested night receptionist to just get us new batteries and guess what he came to our room and suggested us that you need to get up from your bed come closer to TV then remote would work, i confirmed again if he really suggested us to do so and he actually said yes. we remained quiet and decided to sleep instead of watching TV. Next morning i went down myself with remote and told the lady to get me new batteries and she called the maintenance guy who quickly changed the batteries and it sorted i was happy with maintenance guy who would rather solve the problem instead of suggesting this and that. Dinner ordered and guess what we got a lonely small chunk of meat floating in a big plate, and chips soaked in blood oozing out from steak. order was wrong we had to call again to get it corrected. at every point we were dictated by staff like we are idiots. to be very honest i stayed in other hotel in my last stay they were like family and ensured we leave happily but here staff was so dry and dictating. At checkout the lady Maria was quite diplomatically active girl which is a plus point to business to keep the customer engaged. She did welcome our feedback and took care of us. Overall its okay experience. they have a roof top as a bonus point with a small swimming pool, i loved that area, room was good, a housekeeping girl Ranjit was nice always ready to help better than the ladies at reception. I would highly suggest customers to confirm about the food what comes in plate as it is not clearly mentioned in the menu e.g. size or weight of sirloin steak, plus what it comes with, eesh i get goose bumps when i imagine that lonely steak served to me. Plus points, Breakfast was great large options, room was good and i think their F&B manager was quite nice and active i noticed he was so polite and kind with his staff if i am not mistaken a guy in black suit came in the restaurant during breakfast time. Looks like their GM or Ops with grey hair was also active. but whats the point when your staff is not really active, communication gaps especially at reception, dictating guests night staff, slow moving, staff with partially tied hair in the restaurant during breakfast not good although girls were nicely smiling. things could go much better with staff. Trust me i have been to hotels where nothing right about the hotel but staff and i left happily due to incredibly attentive staff.

13,The first room I was assigned was not finished - this can happen and was probably more unpleasant for the reception than for me. The second room was big but with an unappetizing dirty carpet (this would have to be changed urgently). On the 6th floor I had a wonderful view. Bathroom with bathtub and separate shower. Nespresso machine. The hotel has a spacious parking garage. The Ramblas can be reached faster than I expected with the help of a city map (intermediate roads). There are also minus points for the roommates who are very noisy after 9 o'clock (probably intentionally).,"May 8, 2019","0    Crowne Plaza Barcelona - Fira Center

14,"Stayed for 3 nights over Easter weekend really nice hotel with decent sized comfortable rooms,however there seemed to be almost constant noise ,people pushing trolleys about at night which really disturbed my sleep.Also the prices in the bar were really steep,about 3-4 times dearer than the local bars.","May 6, 2019","0    Crowne Plaza Barcelona - Fira Center

15,"I have been visiting Barcelona a lot during last 5-6 years and this hotel killed me by check in at 15.00 and the worth room service I have ever met in Barcelona. I was telling this to reception but really it was just ""ok"" from them or making phone calls to someone, no more. Also they are only focus for club members and of you are a not a club member, you can forget of a lot of things. ","May 5, 2019","0    Crowne Plaza Barcelona - Fira Center

16,"We stayed at the Crowne Plaza for three nights at the end of an road trip, and were really happy about the stay. Location is great in an area of Barcelona that we hadn't been to before, and there are a lot of great restaurants around.We stayed in a one bedroom suite, and therefore checked in through the Club Lounge. Check in process was pleasant, and the lounge itself of great quality. We ate breakfast there in the mornings and although not the largest selection, it had all the essentials and I would therefore rate it higher that the full ones on many other hotels we stayed in. We were under the assumption that there would be food in the evenings also, but the one day we tried there were neither any food nor any people there, so maybe we misunderstood.The room was of decent size with a nice balcony, bathroom with both tub and shower and a comfortable bed. The view was straight into the Fira Center so not too much to write home about, but the weather wasn't too balcony friendly anyway. For the same reason we only had a quick view at the rooftop bar and pool area, but I'm sure it would have been a great place to be on a hotter summer day. Only slight disappointment was that I ordered a large taxi through the lounge well ahead of our scheduled departure, but when we arrived with our luggage no one had heard about it and the taxi was not there. We were never in any risk of losing our flights, but had to sit cramped together in a small taxi because of all our luggage. Not a big deal, but still an improvement area with regards to communication. If you don't have any special preference when it comes to taxis though, there are pretty much always some waiting outside. All in all though we will definitely consider returning again next time we're in Barcelona.","April 28, 2019","0    Crowne Plaza Barcelona - Fira Center

17,"We stayed here on a recent family break in Barcelona and found everything to do with the Crowne Plaza as excellent.Upon checkin my status was recognised and taken to the club lounge to take us through what was needed. This meant for our stay we had been upgraded, even though the room was on points, to get lounge access and a much bigger room.The room was very large and as a suite meant we had sleeping areas for ourselves and the separate room for the kids. The decor was modern, rooms all spotless and the sleep quality was great with a quiet location.The facilities were also great with plenty of eating options, roof bar where the pool is and also a gym and option spa if you want that.The staff were all super friendly throughout, breakfast in the lounge had plenty of options and was a great place to spend some time over the day or in to the evening.Will be back to Barcelona and back to the Crowne Plaza!","April 22, 2019","0    Crowne Plaza Barcelona - Fira Center

The staff are very nice and friendly, especially the lady at the buffet breakfast entrance was very nice to us and our little girl.

19,"We stayed in the Gothic Quarter last week. Due to change in plans we moved from the Wittmore (they were booked) to Crowne Plaza. We're glad we did. The neighborhood is residential and lovely. The Catalan National Art Museum is a couple of blocks away. Walking is a joy as there are few tourists, no crowds. The hotel is a little worn, but the bedding and beds are top notch. The staff is super. The value if unbelievable. We have a very large suite with club level priviledges. The club has a full bar, wine, champs, soft drinks, snacks- all day! Twice a day snacks turn into sandwiches, wraps, and kababs! There is a buffet breakfast thats pretty good. The best is the dedicated club concierge. They solve problems like well oiled machines. We wanted to extend our vacation, our other hotel (which we loved) had no room! The Crowne Plaza made lemonade out of our lemons!","April 15, 2019","0    Crowne Plaza Barcelona - Fira Center

20,"I have to start with the manager who was on charge on the day of our stay, tall thin gentleman with grey hair, I feel sorry not to remember his name: he was extremely helpful and friendly with us, he made my kid very happy by some favors and he also saved us money by being generous on some services. He made me a future returning customer for sure. Reception staff was also nice and the same applies for the young trainee in the rooftop bar, which is a great spot by the way.

Small problem with the toilet flush was fixed immediately I reported it.Super-helpful staff on reception, can't do enough for you. Delicious toiletries. Free water.The only small let-down was breakfast. The breakfast room feels a bit institutional and the food was oddly set out at different points around the room. An omelette/waffle station would be nice, but I know breakfast isn't a big thing in Spain!Located at the bottom of Montjuic just a few steps from the Magic Fountain and from Placa Espana, with plenty of great eating places nearby.","April 11, 2019","0    Crowne Plaza Barcelona - Fira Center

22,"I would've expected to pay double for the quality, location and service we had at Crowne Plaza. I haven't loaded my Trip Advisor account up for years. But staying here made me want to re-load it back up. We stayed for 3 nights in a standard room. Which has 2 double beds AND a seating area. The bathroom had all we needed. There was a separate hall between the front door and room itself. Huge TV. Free Wifi too. Breakfast was a little pricey at 19 euros for a basic buffet but it's convenient.The pool top bar and swimming pool are perfect for couples who want a chilled weekend in-between sight-seeing. It turns out that we were in the same hotel as the Athletico Madrid players too. Which was a bonus sharing a lift with them as the prepared to play Barcelona. The only slight downside is that the Spa opens at 11am, which is peak time for sight-seeing. So we couldn't really make use of the offers they had. But that was a minor set back. A great hotel. 5 minutes walk from MetroTaxi Rank outsidePlenty of shops and restaurants within stone-throwing distance.","April 9, 2019","0    Crowne Plaza Barcelona - Fira Center

In the restaurant they remembered it was a birthday and my wife's desert came with a candle and a blazing 'firework'! In the Club Lounge we were met at breakfast by 'Merce' who brought us our hot beverage; after the first morning she had memorised our requirements and we were met by her with our drinks as we sat down. I noticed she did this for others too - a great feat of memory and one of those little touches that makes you feel welcome away from home.","March 23, 2019","0    Crowne Plaza Barcelona - Fira Center

Hotel is primarily aimed at business through its location but is good for the tourist too.Standout service throughout our stay and fantastic attention to detail by all the staff. Room spacious and well fitted with usual amenities.Breakfast good, great views from the bar on the roof. Barcelona is big so no location is going to cover everywhere.

28,"My wife stayed here for two weeks (Jan 2019) for work commitments and I joined her for a long weekend break. The hotel is very clean with state of the art facilities and is well located to alot of nearby attractions which are easily walkable (Magic Fountain/ MNAC) and is only 5 mins walk from Plaza Espanya stop (metro or Aerobus bus stop to / from airport which is 20 mins). Only a 15 mins walk to Las Ramblas / Gothic quarter district.The room was spacious with the huge flat TV and free Wi-Fi throughout the hotel and the view from 3rd floor lobby lift area is unbelievable.Have to say the one of the most friendly and very helpful receptionists (Judith) to answer all our common tourist questions (mainly due to taxi strike) but the main attraction for us was the barmen (Walter) as he was just lovely and very friendly every time we visited the bar which was most evenings and he is a great asset to the hotel but be warned the prices a bit high but Walter compensated for this.!!! Also, a good range of breakfast choices but we never got to use the main restaurant.Overall, great hotel, good location, great friendly (English speaking) staff. We were very pleased with our stay, and we hope to be back in the future.Definitely would recommend this hotel to family/friends.","February 22, 2019","0    Crowne Plaza Barcelona - Fira Center

We really appreciate the kindness of all the staff (multilingual), especially Suzanna who attended us at The Lounge. We will probably reconsider this hotel for our future stays in BCN.","January 27, 2019","0    Crowne Plaza Barcelona - Fira Center

31,Crowne Plaza Barcelona is a class establishment no doubt about it. Rooms modern and comfortable. Service efficient and extremely business-like and if that suits your character this is the place to be. It lacks heart and soul though in my opinion. Very clinical service and no one really prepared to go that extra step to ensure a warm welcome. Would I stay again yes for the cleanliness and comfort but as a holiday maker I just desired a little more personality and the occasional smile.,"January 16, 2019","0    Crowne Plaza Barcelona - Fira Center

32,"We stayed at this hotel for two nights prior to going on a cruise. The hotel was clean, very nice rooms, large in fact considering some european rooms are. The bathroom was very spacious as well! The only issue we had was that the air did not work in our room and we could not get anyone to come up and fix it. Due to the time of year it was this was not to bad there was just no air flow at all.Our first night we had dinner in the main restaurant on the ground floor and the service and food was amazing! We then went up to the rooftop lounge for a night cap. The view was beautiful! Wonderful atmosphere!Perfect way to start a trip through europe. I would stay at this hotel again.","January 15, 2019","0    Crowne Plaza Barcelona - Fira Center

35,"This is a lovely hotel in the city, it's a great base for exploring the sights or visiting for business. Upon arriving the staff were extremely welcoming and I was surprised at the size of the rooms, the room was huge which is quite unusual in Europe. The bed was very comfortable, lovely lounge area and TV as well as a lovely big bathroom. One of my favourite parts of the hotel was the rooftop pool which is built in such a unique way and has a gorgeous view of the city. From here you can see many of the major sights and have a drink or snack at the bar. It's close to the underground stations and only a few minutes walk from the magic fountain which is a great show to be seen at night. Overall, I'd definitely recommend this hotel and would stay 100% stay again.","December 17, 2018","0    Crowne Plaza Barcelona - Fira Center

37,"We arrived at this perfectly located hotel after a long day of touring and couldn't have been happier upon entering the lobby. The hotel is clean, modern and chic. Staff were immediately helpful--from the bellman to the desk clerks to the manager--and made us feel welcome and cared for. We were upgraded to spacious, immaculately-clean, comfortable rooms on the third floor and given Club Lounge Access. We had drinks, yummy tapas and delicious desserts for dinner in the Club Lounge and enjoyed an abundant and tasty breakfast--complete with Moet Champagne at both--the next morning. The bathrooms were large with great water pressure and huge, fluffy bath sheets as well as really nice bath products. The room also had a complimentary drink tray with bottled waters, coffees, teas, and hot chocolates. From this excellent location, we walked out of the hotel, to the left for three minutes and arrived at the Font Magica where we viewed a truly magical light/music/water show. The Bull Ring was seven minutes by foot and Los Ramblas about 15. We all agreed this hotel provided the perfect final night of our vacation.

38,"This modern structure that was formerly the Fira Palace, impresses from the outside even before entering thru the revolving door. A doorman invites you in, and the front desk is where the staff makes you feel like a VIP. We were greeted by, Michella and Jeanine, (please forgive any miss-spellings). Explaining all of the IHG benefits available, we left with some sweets to our room.We decided to visit the 173 roof top terrace (separate TA review) for a light meal before getting a good night's sleep. The beds are firm and comfortable, the various pillows can be arranged to help you achieve la la land. The modern bathrooms rates a ten plus. Everything about them, layout, easy to operate fixtures, and lighting were perfect. The only hiccup was housekeeping neglecting to leave two wash cloths, fixed later by staff.The buffet breakfast at L' Aria was a great way to start all of our travel days. Mostly mediterranean, with ""english breakfast"" style hot food, and some asian cuisine. I found it had enough of a selection to satisfy. Attentive staff constantly refilled my coffee ""americano"". Also juices, fruits, and lots of baked goods to chose from. Note to us fussy americans, nothing is seedless, or pitted, so you know. This place only serves breakfast from 7:00 am. till 10:30 am. Earlier the better is recommended. Even though the Crowne Plaza Hotel is primarily set up for the business traveler, it exceeded expectations in comfort, and has many amenities for all purposes. It was our ideal base of operation. With a queue of cab drivers just out side the front to whisk you anywhere. It was an easy walk to some major points of interest. You will feel safe and secure here, as it is next to a police station, (did not hear any sirens). Room safes are always a plus. Room temperature was easy to adjust.I must go back to service. Jeanine was exemplary on more than one occasion. She walked into El Mall, when no one picked up the phone, to see if a table would be available for us. Her level of customer service was ""five diamond"" as they say. we were able to have a late check out time, allowing for seamless transfer and boarding of our cruise ship. I will whole heartily recommend the Crowne Plaza- Fira Center, to all friends and family who venture to world class Barcelona.","November 26, 2018","0    Crowne Plaza Barcelona - Fira Center

39,"The Crowne Plaza -Fira Center is a great hotel! I highly recommend it for anyone visiting Barcelona that wants to be somewhat removed from all the craziness of the Ramblas district! The facility is state-of-the art and is very well maintained. The rooms are large, comfortable and very clean. The bathrooms (especially the shower) are exceptional. We only had one minor problem during our five night stay. For whatever reason, we were unable to get face towels in our room despite repeated requests. Beyond that, all was very good!I want to give special kudos the Jeannie at the front desk. Although a new employee, Jeannie provided exceptional service to us. She was gracious, kind and very welcoming to us after a very long journey from Los Angeles. Jeannie was very helpful and answered all my questions straightaway. She is a true asset to the hotel's team! Very well done, Jeannie! The hotel's public places are spacious and comfortable. The amenities (spa, restaurants and business center) are all very good. (Food in the restaurants was also excellent.) I would certainly stay at the Crowne Plaza -Fira Center again when I visit Barcelona. The employees and management are true professionals and are genuinely committed to providing a high level of service to their guests.

41,"I stayed in this hotel for 3 nights for business.The hotel is located just right next to Fira Centre (an exhibition ground) and just a very short walk to the Fountain and the Italian Twin Towers. A short walk to the main road and there are plenty of restaurants and eateries. It is also not far from the airport (20 minutes by taxi) and the Renfe high speed rail station (about 8 minutes by taxi, or walk for about 1.5 km).Room was spacious and up to date. Buffet breakfast has a good spread and cater to Asian palate also. The hotel is also stayed by air crews from a few Chinese airlines.The top floor of the hotel houses a restaurant bar. It has a great view of the city day and night.Though I wanted to try to spa centre, I was told that it was fully booked and impossible to have walk-in customer. Must be a very popular place for the locals to relax..Room was of a very good size to accommodate a sofa (bed). Overall, it was a very pleasant stay except for a few minor points below:1) My friend and I checked in past midnight. It seems that there was no update of information after we have checked in. Rooms were not made the following day, and our names were not in the breakfast list though we have paid for it. We were even charged for the 1st day breakfast though we have paid in advance.2) The roof garden bar/restaurant was understaffed and the poor waiter/bartender had to do a lot of thing by himself. He was very apologetic for it. It was not a problem for me as I am used to some self service back home.Overall, it was still a very good place to stay. The surrounding was safe and well know. Near to everywhere we need to go in Barcelona.Will stay there again if happens to travel to Barcelona.","November 15, 2018","0    Crowne Plaza Barcelona - Fira Center

The Front Office and Housekeeping staff were quite good. I was impressed with them. The Room Service order taker hurried you. I would also like to mention the Spa, amazing service, we tried the massages. Also, the aquatonic pool was wonderful. The elderly gentleman was very professional! Great staff.

50,"Recently stayed for a business trip The breakfast restaurant area doesn't have enough tables when the hotel's busy. The staff are unable to clean the tables fast enough, so you have guests wandering around trying to find a clean, set table. Having said that, the waiting staff generally could do with some customer training. The two waitresses were excellent, all the men were off-hand and seemed to resent being there. The male manager made fleeting appearances and didn't actually do anything apart from pose at one end of the room or the other.Food at breakfast was very ordinary. No fresh cooked section, yet calling itself a 4 star business-friendly hotel. I don't think so. Ran out of cereal spoons twice. Cold meats not replenished very quickly.Reception staff were in a different category. Really good. Nothing too much bother. Chambermaids too were great, happy to fetch extra tissues or toilet rolls or hangers. Can't fault them.The hotel has a problem with it's flat roof sections. A downpour led to flooding in one of the main conference rooms, with water streaming through the ceiling. Needs some maintenance.All in all, disappointing.

I had a suite which had a small bar area with a nespresso machine, kettle, minibar etc. There is a dining/meeting table, massive TV in the living area in addition to another TV in the bedroom (although the remote for the large TV didn't work - could be battery fault, as the remote in the bedroom worked on both TVs). There's a desk with a super comfy executive chair with leg/foot rest. There's a balcony, but the sliding doors are tricky to lock, although there is a security latch.I had 2 double beds in the room. The whole place had lots of mirrors! The bathroom is separated by a door - bath, toilet, bidet on one side, sink and shower on the other. Toiletries included separate shampoo and conditioner, shower gel, body lotion, bar soap. Slippers and bathroom provided. Huge towels - always a sign of a good hotel! The air conditioning was super efficient! There's separate air conditioning for the bedroom and the dining/living area. The lifts are really quick. House keeping are patient and efficient - I was in and out of the room during the day, and they still managed to find a gap to clean the room!Breakfast was OK, had adequate provisions, although for a great hotel like this, I thought the breakfast was only average, but certainly satisfactory.I had room service, which took an acceptable 20 minutes, but unfortunately was rather tasteless - thankfully pepper and salt were provided, I had to use a lot of them!Check in and check out was easy. I had to leave at 4am, and they kindly organised a taxi for me, but there are often taxis just outside the hotel. 20 minutes away from the airport.Minutes walk away from the popular Magic Fountain, the adjacent areas are worth exploring.

68,"Booked two rooms for three nights. Check-in was quick. Found the front desk personnel very professional, always eager to assist especially with great restaurant recommendations, and friendly (well most of them). A great lobby with a cool vibe. Fantastic rooftop pool and lounge area with a view of the Sagrada Familia. Rooms were nice sized and well appointed. Really nice, large bathrooms. As others have mentioned, the location is great for touring the Sagrada Familia, but is away from the old town and beach areas. With that said, there were always taxis in front of the hotel with rides typically 8-10 euros to get to most places. Will stay here again next time in Barcelona.","May 30, 2019","1    Hotel Barcelona 1882

69,"We recently completed a two week trip and by far this was my favourite place to stay. The hotel is situated a block away from the Gaudi Basilica Sagrada Familia and is very modern and clean. The rooms were spacious and well equipped with the usual amenities. The pool and sun deck on the roof top make it an amazing place to chill out and enjoy the view (it also has an amazing view of the basilica from the roof top as well). The staff were also very friendly and accommodating. Although we travelled as a group of friends, the hotel would be suitable for couples and familes. Will definately be back on my next trip to Barcelona.","May 29, 2019","1    Hotel Barcelona 1882

70,"Well not sure where to begin. 25 th anniversary surprise set up by the blokes..After choosing 1882 as the stay over, bearing in mind there is a great deal of choice, I went for a Sa Grada view. Well “if its good enough for Gaudi its good enough for me”.The staff have been awesome they changed keys for us to allow the surprise to unfurl before the girls eyes, great at the bar and the door Anna gave us a recommend for Bar Mut- just don’t buy wine there The hotel foyer is welcoming with great looking seating - not the leather look that makes you look out of place when sat in it. Spend a couple of hours from 5pm on cheese wine order more drinks then hit the restaurant of your choice. Don’t forget to book if its special...Rooms are clean and functional beds are good guys but this hotel should be enjoyed on the roof in the pool lounging taking selfies looking across Famillia Barca. Then later downstairs in the bar area. Breakfast is a great set up with all that you could want in choice. It will get you to the first cafe stop of the day..I’m staying again when in Barca see you then 1882...","May 27, 2019","1    Hotel Barcelona 1882

71,"The staff is friendly and helpful. We had an incident with the bartender ( who doesn't work there anymore) and The manager was quick to remedy. Be sure to book with the morning breakfast buffet. Once afternoon we ordered the assortment of croquettes, grilled octopus with candied potato and the Iberian ham with bread and tomato with Cava and beer. The food is very good and all is reasonably priced. Go to the top floor deck for the great views, there is a pool, we didn't use as it was cold. The bar will run up drinks to you if you ask. There is a free walking tour- don't miss this & the gentlemen was wonderful. The hotel lobby and bar area is relaxing and cozy, we stopped here each evening just to sit with the house vermouth before heading to bed. Our room was also cozy ( we did take the peanut dish to use for the soap dish and took face clothes from another hotel bath room as these are not available) shhh..... don't tell.. The towels and product are nice, I rented a robe for 10 for the week and was worth it. My husband and I didn't have an issue with the bathroom as others have indicated in their reviews. The bed was comfortable and we slept well each night, having an inside room ( which didn't have any views) we were okay with that. Cheers to the staff who were very helpful - getting us directions and making suggestions to where to go. We had a fabulous experience at this hotel and would book there again.

88,This is the WORST experience I’ve had at a hotel. I will never ever stay at this hotel AGAIN. My sister and I walked into the hotel after hours of flying. We are two small girls and we had multiple bags with us. We were struggling to carry our bags to get into the hotel. The men at the front desk saw us visibly struggling to carry our bags and not one of them tried to help us.Once we checked in I asked if there was someone that could help us with our bags. The man at the front desk stated that “there was no one to help us with our bags” but I saw multiple people that worked at the hotel lounging around... the hotel also messed up our room. We requested two beds but they assigned us with a room with one bed.. and stated that the hotel was fully booked for the night.. I also had an issue when I was checking out. They stated that they would be charging my card 18 euros for “national calls” that I made. The only calls that I made was locally and that was to call the tourist office for an excursion I booked. The man at the front desk was very rude and I overall had an HORRIBLE experience at this hotel. I recommend anyone that is considering to stay at this hotel to find somewhere else. There are MUCH nicer hotels in Barcelona that actually have great hospitality. I repeat STAY AWAY FROM THIS HOTEL. They have the worst hospitality and the people at the front desk have the nastiest attitudes. This hotel is money hungry and will try to charge you for everything!Stay away from this place and use your money towards a nicer and classier hotel.

106,"Perfect location that everyone first visits Barcelona can dream of. Very near to the Sagrada Familia. The hotel was newly furbished and everything in very good shape. The room is spacious and comfortable. Great decor, excellent facilities, enormous bed. Lovely view at the terrace. Breakfast was yum with wide range of choice. Staff are helpful and friendly - ask for recommendation of restaurant and you won't be disappointed. Definitely would return if we got any chance to be back to the lovely Barcelona.","March 12, 2019","1    Hotel Barcelona 1882

107," This was our first stay with HB 1882 and I can't recommend them enough. All the staff were friendly and helpful (and spoke English if your Catalan/spanish is a bit rusty like mine) . Our room was a good size for a couple, modern with a large double bed which was very comfy, it had wardrobe space, a chair, shelving and large tv (if you feel the need to watch tv in Barcelona) the room also had a mini bar, hair dryer etc.. The shower was great and fitted with both a large shower head and small one, great after walking the city all day... The bar and lounge area is fabulous, very stylish and comfortable just great for chilling out with a glass or two and our barman Sergi was brilliant, and price of drinks were very reasonable. (The lounge area is also equipped with laptops to use and there are plenty of books to read too). We didn't partake in the breakfast so can't comment on the food, but from what I saw it looked very nice. The icing on the cake for us is HB 1882's roof terrace, it is absolutely amazing with great views of the top half of the La Sagrada Familia. Plenty of selfie opportunities (depending on time of year sunrise on the terrace is great).. Lots of comfy seating up there too, so grab a coffee or a glass of wine and sit back and relax, because thats what this hotel is made for.. They do have a gym etc (but didn't use it) the pool did look very inviting but might have to come back in the summer to use that . We easily walked to the Familia in 10 minutes from the hotel.. (I also recommended taking a walk back to the Familia at night, it's beautiful when lit up) Thank you to all the staff at Hotel Barcelona 1882 for giving us a warm welcome and making our stay in Barcelona more enjoyable, we will definitely come back for another stay.Thanks again, Marie & Brian Simpson.

Breakfast is buffet style and was always refilled. Never a problem with seating or food. Staff very helpful if you needed anything. Coffee out of machine was lovely. Fresh fruit as well as pastries and cold meat. Reception staff helpful and informative. Advised us of transport links to Barcelona’s football ground. Always welcomed you with a good morning or hello. Metro is literally around the corner and beach is 10 minute walk away. Management are helpful and brilliant. We had a problem with waiters from a restaurant following us back to hotel over a dispute with bill. Police were called. Management very supportive, helpful and reassuring.

Great pool and bar on the top floor! Barcelona can be over whelming. Leave lots of time for traveling within the city. Traffic is bad, to say the least! The hotel is not close to old town, but we found the taxi`s to be reasonable. If you plan on seeing any of the sites, sign up for a tour, The crowds are huge!

112,"We have just returned from a three night stay at this hotel with our two boys (13 and 10). When we booked we knew the hotel wasn’t in the thick of things but the pull for us was the inter-connecting rooms and roof top pool. This meant our two boys could have their own space (rather than sleeping on a sofa bed which many of the other hotels offered). It also meant after a day of a lot of walking and sightseeing we could sit by the pool for a while. The hotel is situated right by the metro which is easily navigated and cheap. It’s a 10-15 min walk straight down to the beach/marina area where there are loads of restaurants to choose from. The hotel itself is modern and stylish. The rooms are large with very comfortable beds. Shower worked well too. Breakfast is held in the reception area and is continental (cheeses, ham, tortilla, pastries, bread, cereal, juices, fruit, coffee machine). There were nice touches for smaller children too, high chairs, a small children’s area with puzzles and books. The rooftop pool had a bar where you could get your drinks and pool towels. The staff were hardworking and very friendly. We all had a great time in Barcelona and it was good to know that we could go back to a nice hotel which was good value. We would definitely recommend this hotel and would return.","June 1, 2019","2    Ibis Styles Barcelona City Bogatell

The metro is very easy to navigate and reasonably priced. It's close-ish to the waterfront.

Hotel has a real modern feel to it from the reception area to the rooms.Rooms are modern / very comfortable bed / walk in shower. Hotel staff are friendly and always on hand to help.Breakfast is good- plenty of fruit / toast / breads / croissants / ham / cheeses available with a range of juices and hot drinks.Pool area is nice / great for relaxing - personally i think more sun loungers rather than deck chairs should be up there but that’s just personal preference.Location - right next to Bogatell metro line which makes getting to most places pretty easy.Highly recommend!,"April 19, 2019","2    Ibis Styles Barcelona City Bogatell

The walk felt safe at night.The hotel is only 2 years old so clean and modern with funky public areas. The rooms are nothing special but clean and functional. The real shame is the low quality of the mattresses. I do not normally have problems with hotel's mattresses as they always seem to have good quality ones which last longer but this hotel has very soft and uncomfortable mattresses and the 4 of us complained of it which is a first ! Would not stay for more than one or max. 2 nights on that basis. The staff was friendly and breakfast was typical of a 2* property with some cold meats, cheese/cereals and pastries.

120,The room is lovely and modern as is the rest of the facilities. Unfortunately the air conditioning is as cold as........well. It wasn't......there's no refrigerator or safe. The rooftop pool sounds like a perfect reason to vouch for this place but even a 22°C temperature was enough to keep me out of the pool because they must pipe the water directly from Antarctica which made it uncomfortably cold even in the Spain beautiful weather. So to be perfectly honest. I didn't have a pleasant stay here. Which is a shame. Because the look of the hotel would suggest otherwise. Staff are great also. Breakfast was ...meh. I guess it's ok if the location suits you best. But as an honest review I'd say look elsewhere,"March 23, 2019","2    Ibis Styles Barcelona City Bogatell

121,"We arrived at around 2130 on the Friday evening for 3 nights bed and breakfast. Check in was quick and easy, we’d booked via Booking.com and paid on arrival. The reception area was welcoming and looked appealing. Restaurant seating area on the left, bar and comfy seats on the right. Upon entering our twin room we were pleasantly surprised, bright airy room which was very modern. Bathroom looked amazing, very clean and light. The beds are very comfy, plugs next to each bed. Our room was at the end of a corridor so didn’t have much noise from neighbours or people walking along the corridor. Only negative was the rooms were very warm at night. Breakfast is continental which we were aware of, choice of cold meat, cheese, yogurts, cereal, fresh fruit and coffee machines. On race day the hotel provided extra fruit and cereal bars which was a nice treat. Plenty of seating, we were a group of 18 and all managed to sit on one long table. Tea and coffee are available all day long and if there empty the reception staff will refill promptly. The bar is very reasonable, €2.20 for a glass of rose, €3.50 for 0.5l of lager. USB ports around all the seated areas which was good.We chose this hotel as it was close to the start and finish line of the half marathon and we definitely chose right, 10/15 minute walk, although it took slightly longer on return due to sore legs!! Close to metro stop and a 10 minute walk to the beach. Would definitely stay again. ","February 17, 2019","2    Ibis Styles Barcelona City Bogatell

I think it's over-priced.The room was very small and very basic.....the plus points were the bed was comfortable and the shower was powerful. the towels were tatty and very old. We didn't enjoy the breakfast at all....... I accept that it's Spain and is continental, but I thought the ingredients were cheap and cheerful to say the least.....the coffee was awful !The food from the bar was poor in our opinion......frozen pizzas and 'again' cheap ingredients.The beer was averagely priced at 3.75 euros per pint.The roof-top pool is a nice addition.....albeit very cramped and my relaxation was spoilt by a large group of very loud French tourists.....why they have to shout every sentence is baffling!?If I came to Barcelona again, I would consider staying here, but only if it was half the cost of what I've just paid?","October 1, 2018","2    Ibis Styles Barcelona City Bogatell

140,"Nice clean hotel. Bonus of a rooftop terrace pool and bar (although pool is very cold).Quirky with fun features such as courtyard with table tennis.Decent buffet breakfast also.Well located to jump on the Metro, less than a five min walk to the station. Only 10/15 min walk to the beach too so best of both worlds. A good few restaurants around the hotel too.Was perfect for our 3 night stay to get out and about see and do everything we wanted to.

143,"I'm not fussy about a lot of stuff but some things just weren't right... We decided on Ibis Styles for the location and the swimming pool and did not disappoint on that matter. As you walk into the hotel there a very strong smell that is not very pleasant, in my opinion. The room was very small and the windows didn't allow a lot of natural light. After a shower, all the bathroom floor would be wet which was a bit annoying...Also, the breakfast area is extremely busy and a bit disorganized, I think. I felt like I was bothering other people who were sitting there having their breakfast because I had to queue next to them for the coffee or bread. On the other hand, the swimming pool is beautiful and has a nice view over the city and it's only a 10-15 min walk to the beach. Downstairs bar a little bit high priced as it's about 30min walk to the city center and the attractions and there is not a lot of cafe or restaurants around the hotel.","September 18, 2018","2    Ibis Styles Barcelona City Bogatell

145,"Most things in life are good or bad by comparation with their referrals. The problem with this ibis - that is not bad per si - is just that you have a lot more options around these days, in walking distance and on the same price range that are not your classic 2 stars hotel - not that there is any problem with 2 stars hotels. It just is not the same thing.Also of note, I stayed for 14 days or so, working every late night for the 14 days and I slept in most of the days. I had problems with the cleaning service because there was no way for them to clean after I leave, because there is no service after 2 pm, and no way for them to arrange it for me. This might be a very specific complain, but if you are thinking about late night parties or have to work late like me do not go for this hotel.","September 10, 2018","2    Ibis Styles Barcelona City Bogatell

149,"Stayed for 4 nights in August 2018 and very pleased overall.Service was hit and miss, some staff were great and others a little rude. Was surprised to have to pay a deposit to use the iron and carry the iron and board around the busy hotel myself but perhaps this is normal in Spain?Was disappointed to find no safe in our room, fortunately we were able to lock valuables in our suitcase when we were out.Rooftop pool is small and there are only 2 sunbeds and about 8 deck chairs plus some tables and chairs by the bar. Mostly though we had no issue getting somewhere to sit. The bar was very reasonable at 2.50 for beer, wine & soft drinks.Location was good being around a 10 minute walk straight down 1 road to the beach. 30 mins walk to Las Ramblas and slightly less to the zoo and Sagrada Familia. I recommend downloading the MyTaxi app which lets you book, pay and tip from your phone and was very quick service. Also check out Donkey Republic which allows you to hire bikes for 24 hours and unlock with your phone!Good restaurants in all directions, can recommend La Carmelina & El 58.","August 28, 2018","2    Ibis Styles Barcelona City Bogatell

150,"You really do get what you pay for, you pay cheap prices to stay here for a reason, rooms are small with very little storage for belongings, rooms are very basic with no a safe which in a city notorious for theft I found alarming. The rooms were however very clean and well kept, only one English Channel on the tv though! The bag with the hair dryer in was growing mould, and stank of damp. Staff were not very helpful or welcoming on arrive and throughout our stay. We were also given incorrect times with regards to breakfast & the pool, going up at 8.30pm to find the pool closed after being told it was open until 10pm. The pool was crowded, very little seating, and everyone crammed in but it was a pretty little pool and seating area, also provided towels! Very well situated for the metro, which takes you everywhere in the city! The hotel was literally a stones throw away around the corner, and we had no problems finding the hotel by ourselves using it. however the area is very derelict with graffiti everywhere, we also stepped off the metro to a child in the middle of the street no older than 10 intimidating us by waving his genitalia around laughing and pointing at us. stay vigilant throughout your stay in Barcelona and watch your bags, locals do NOT like tourists.Breakfast was a continental cold breakfast which was enough to tide you over until lunch with a couple of different choices, however everything was disposable with regards to cups and cutlery, and the plates were not very clean with dried food still compressed under most.

153,"Stayed here for 3 nights with the gf to see the sights. Decent location a little away from the centre and the loud tourist spots. 15 minute walk from the beach and 30 second walk from metro station on the yellow line that leads to the gothic quarter.Room was a good size with a large extremely comfortable double bed, black out curtains, modern bathroom with a great shower (shower gel included). Easy to use air con was excellent and a life saver when you come in from walking around the whole day in the heat. Good size TV with local channels if you need it. Hairdryer could’ve been a bit more powerful, no in-room safe, minibar or ironing board, however. Roof terrace and pool is nice for a short bit of sunbathing or reading, with a small bar serving a small selection of drinks, if you’re lucky enough to find a sun-bed. View from the terrace isn’t spectacular but can’t complain. Both the terrace and shallow pool are very small compared to the capacity of the hotel - not ideal if you want to use it as part of a family/big group.Breakfast is very good compared to other places - selection of breads, hams, cheeses, fruit, hot drinks and juice - best to get there early though as it gets busy. Reception has a outside lounge area with table tennis and 24/7 bar with very good prices. Multilingual staff were very helpful and friendly and had no problem storing our luggage on the last day while we went out. So good in fact we left a present for them in the room which I hope they drank. Would definitely stay again but should probably upgrade the terrace and pool.","August 3, 2018","2    Ibis Styles Barcelona City Bogatell

159,"A very nice hotel. I would give it at least 3 stars. Room is big comparing to Ibis hotels in Paris for example. Simple, but well equipped, very comfortable bed and good bathroom.The breakfast is quite unvaried: pastry, yoghurts, fruits, ham, cheese, cereals. Some eggs were really missing.Good location: 10-15 minutes on foot from the beach and 4-5 metro stations to the city center. Bogatell Metro station is just round the corner.Small rooftop pool is nice, although there are only 4 real beds for sunbathing, others are just chairs (chaises longues). So a couple of times I had to put the towel on the floor and take the tan this way.One disturbing thing: I got bitten by some insects 2 times. Maybe it was during the night out, but I felt like it was in the hotel. These itchy red spots appeared twice in the morning and not at night.The water is very mild, so it feels like you still have some shower gel on you even after you wash it off really well.Also the price was a quite high, but I believe if you book in advance or if you stay not at very high season it would be fairer.","July 14, 2018","2    Ibis Styles Barcelona City Bogatell

Wonderful staff that gave great recommendations for dining and provided great directions for those of us who are directionally challenged. When we returned we were pleasantly surprised to learn that we had been upgraded to a terrace room! All I can say is WOW!!! The view was to die for, an unbelievable unobstructed view of the top of Casa Mila, La Pedrera. It was like looking at a painting and one night there was even a jazz band that played, what more could you ask for??The room was top notch, bed was very comfortable with tons of pillows. Robes and slippers are provided along with complimentary water, yes!!! The bathroom was a good size with a very large shower which could fit an army. Really was not a big fan of the sink, too shallow, every time you turned the water on no matter what flow it splashed out of the bowl.

All buildings on the block open to a common space, so you're seeing the back of every building including people's laundry, storage, back windows, etc.. There is a small rooftop bar that serves snacks and cocktails, with a view of the Casa Mila rooftop. It's pretty cool, if a bit pricey. The star at this property is breakfast though. A strong cold buffet, hand-made espresso drinks or hot tea, and a cooked-to-order hot menu as well. Everything we had was delicious, and, better yet, included with our room rate.

175,"From the moment we walked into the lobby we were impressed with this hotel. There was always a lovely smell in all of the public areas and the welcome drink and snack was a pleasant surprise. We had prepaid for our room so the check in process was simple and relaxed. Our room was a touch on the small side but this was made up for with a nice sized bathroom and a gorgeous private outdoor terrace overlooking one of the Gaudi houses. The bed was very comfortable and the room spotlessly clean. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful. The breakfast was comprehensive and the hot items cooked to order. We had never stayed at a H10 hotel before, but in future we will look out for them as it was so good.","May 30, 2019","3    H10 Casa Mimosa

176,"In summary, there's not a single fault with this hotel. There is only excellence in every department. My wife and I attended this hotel for a weekend break to Barcelona to celebrate our 10 year wedding anniversary and go to the Spanish Grand Prix. Firstly, the hotel looks great as soon as you step inside. Modern, classy, boutique style.The brilliance of this hotel began in earnest immediately upon our arrival where we were greeted and checked in, with a courteous glass of bubbly each by a genuinely friendly, helpful and informative lady. We stayed in a double deluxe room, with a super king size bed. Again, all clean, fresh and modern. A pretty room, with a double shower, double basin bathroom and toilet hidden behind what looks like a wardrobe door. I have no faults with the room. There was good quality wifi also. The real winner for us though was the amazing options at breakfast. There was a small selection of buffet style food, including unlimited fresh fruit and meats etc. However, the cooked selection from the menu was delicious. All cooked fresh upon ordering, were eggs benedict, a simple fry up, waffles and ice cream, crepes and a host of other food.It was all served and presented to a high professional standard, and again if you wanted rounds 2, 3 or 4 there's nothing to stop you ordering! Whats more, is that due to the relatively small number of rooms at the hotel the breakfast was never chaotically busy. Perhaps only 2 or 3 other tables were occupied every time we had breakfast. Special mention to the waitress Vanessa (I think!?) who couldn't do any more for us every breakfast time. The rooftop bar is nice and relaxing, and we visited this first off, before we went out into the evening. All the staff are great and are more than willing to help with all enquiries raised. The location is great also, fairly central to most of the key attractions and only a 20 second walk to one of the Antonio Gaudi houses that are scattered throughout Barcelona and should be visited.If we were to return to Barcelona, i already know which hotel i will be booking to stay at. Simply faultless. A fantastic stay without a single gripe. Those responsible for managing and running the hotel should be applauded on providing a perfect environment for visiting guests and the staff for delivering the service which they provide.10/10.","May 14, 2019","3    H10 Casa Mimosa

We found the staff very helpful and attentive to our needs which was great as we are not familiar with Barcelona or the area. The beds were very comfortable, excellent quality coffee in the room Nespresso which they were more than happy to extra stock with a small tip. The highlight by far was the location and the upgrade to the top deck/balcony (paid). It overlooked the backside of Gaudi's Casa Mila! Simply devine enjoying espresso in the morning overlooking Mila.

189,"My sister and I stayed a week at the H-10, Casa Mimosa and loved it! The room was large with a massive bathroom and the biggest shower I have ever seen. Everything was spotless, and each day we came back to the room seeing the same standard of excellence as we were greeted with the first day. We were greeted with free bottles of water daily and a couple of individual bottles of wine. We didn’t use the robe or the slippers that were in the bathroom, and the last night, they laid the slippers out next to each side of the bed, letting us know they were ours to keep. If my sister reads this, yes, I accidentally took both pair. The view from the rooftop was spectacular. I loved seeing La Pedrera so close to our hotel. When touring the rooftop of La Pedrera, I could easily spot our hotel. The hotel was located so closely to everything. The metro was close, but we walked much of the time and used the cheap taxi service for quick trips across town. They were so easy to get in front of the hotel, and I did not want to waste one minute of my week in Barcelona. Lastly, a hotel is a hotel. What sets this one apart is the excellent customer service. I cannot count the times I asked their advice for best restaurants, where to buy something, and the best wine store. They gave me the names of local faves, not tourist faves. I wasn’t looking for what I would find in America; I wanted to experience the culture. The front desk, the bartenders, and housekeeping went beyond my expectations to provide a truly memorable experience. I will be back. ","April 7, 2019","3    H10 Casa Mimosa

194,"We stayed here from Saturday to Tuesday this March and were so impressed with everything. From the minute we arrived we were given a very friendly greeting and a glass of Cava while we checked in. Despite arriving well before the requested time our room was ready for which we were very grateful.The room was lovely with huge floor to ceiling windows overlooking the garden area to the rear of the property. With a very nice shower room, sleeping area (with huge, very comfortable bed), and adjoining lounge area the room was perfect for our needs.Casa Mimosa is centrally located and proved to be very handy for catching the tour bus for which we had two-day tickets. There is an excellent bakery over the road where you can also sit and have breakfast. There is so much to see in the immediate area and lots of great shops. Just around the corner is the Casa Milà, a building designed by Gaudi and is absolutely stunning. The upper stories and roof of the building can be seen from the gardens of the hotel. The Sagrada Familia is about a 20 minute walk away and this is obviously a must-see. I would recommend one of the guided tours as you learn so much about the building and it’s history.We were very lucky with the weather and were able to sit in the garden area of the hotel and have drinks there. The bar area and lounge are extremely comfortable and the bar staff were very friendly. Actually, every member of staff we met was lovely and always greeted us whenever we passed. This was my first trip to Barcelona (my wife had been before) and I absolutely loved it and we will definitely stay in the Casa Mimosa the next time we visit.","March 20, 2019","3    H10 Casa Mimosa

196,"We booked a ""Deluxe Room"" and were given 106 on the first floor at the front of the building. We were pleasantly surprised by the amount of space - decent sized bedroom with huge bed and generous wardrobe, plus a small sitting room with sofa, desk and mini bar, and a gorgeous bathroom with large shower, freestanding bathtub, bidet and double wash basins, with nice toiletries, plenty of towels, robes and slippers. The only thing in the room I could think was missing was a kettle, but no sooner had I asked than one was delivered, together with mugs and an assortment of teabags. Chocolates were brought every evening of our five night stay. The breakfast buffet was extensive - freshly prepared fruits, yoghurt, cereals, cheeses, meats, breads and cakes. Tea, coffee and freshly squeezed orange juice were brought to our table in the airy and attractive dining room. There was a long menu of dishes cooked to order and the ones we sampled were good. I couldn't resist the chocolate churros one morning.We didn't use the hotel's courtyard garden or roof terrace during our stay as it was not warm enough but both looked beautiful and very well-maintained. The location, on the same block as Gaudi's residential building La Pedrera, was great. Diagonal metro station, just around the corner, puts many other Gaudi sites within easy reach. We could walk to the Ramblas in 5 minutes, to Placa de Catalunya in 15 minutes and to the Sagrada Familia in 20 minutes. There were plenty of shops, bars and restaurants all around the hotel, ranging from simple to extremely upmarket. Pau Claris, the road the hotel is on, is not too busy but , despite double glazing and lined curtains, we could hear a little traffic noise and a bit of streetlighting filtered into our room. If you are a light sleeper or require total darkness, request a room on a higher floor or at the rear.Every member of staff we encountered was helpful and spoke english.

197,"After heavily researching the many hotels in Barcelona, I booked this hotel based on the sheer amount of excellent reviews it received and what a hotel it is!We arrived at Barcelona airport (BCN) and found that even though it is more expensive, a taxi is a convenient way to travel for 4 people with suitcases. The cost of the taxi was €35 and it took us to the door of the hotel, which was ideal. Upon arriving at the hotel we were greeted with very friendly faces and a glass of cava whilst we completed our check in. Due to arriving early one of the rooms was not fully ready, but we were assured that it would be once we returned in the evening after a day out exploring. We were however able to use the other room to store our belongings and this is when our mouths hit the floor! The room (Garden Deluxe Room) was breathtaking, with modern/gothic style rooms filled with contemporary furniture and beautiful views of the garden through fully opening doors, we could not believe what we were seeing. The bed and chairs were comfy and the bathroom had everything you needed including a huge shower, complimentary amenity pack and ritual shower gels and shampoo. There were two bottles of complimentary water per day, welcome chocolates, sangria and a nespresso coffee machine (capsules included). As H10 members we also got a voucher for a welcome cocktail each.Not only is the hotel stunning, but the rooftop terrace boasts a lovely pool, and beautiful views including Le Pedrera. The terrace itself has plenty of comfy seating to enjoy the sunset over the buildings.We did not try breakfast, but the cold buffet and al a carte food did look delicious upon walking through the restaurant.The hotel is very close to Diagonal metro station and a lovely leisurely walk of about 30-40minutes past clothing shops and restaurants to the main Las Ramblas. In order to see the main sights we asked to the hotel to book us a two day hop on, hop off coach tour, which was great to see everything that Barcelona has to offer. The area around the hotel felt safe at night and has a 24hr shop and cafes.I will definitely be returning Barcelona and will 100% revisit this hotel.","March 7, 2019","3    H10 Casa Mimosa

We had a Garden Deluxe room which was lovely, plenty of room and a lovely bathroom with complimentary toiletries and a great shower! Complimentary water each day and a voucher for a free cocktail and two bottles of Sangria was a nice touch together with each evening having chocolates left in the room. There is a good choice for breakfast and something to suit everyone, a choice of egg dishes can be cooked to order. The only thing I would add would be a toaster and a choice of stronger English Breakfast tea bags, I personally like weak tea but the teabags there were not the best, even with two teabags in the teapot it still did not make a decent cup.

The hotel was about a 10 minute walk slightly uphill but do’able with small suitcases. We bought the T10 travel ticket for €10.20 each which gave us 10 rides including the train from the airport. On arrival at the hotel we were greeted with a glass of cava and some goodies to munch on while we completed our check in. Even though it was quite early our beautiful terrace room was ready. The terrace was amazing with views over Le Pedrera and lovely comfy sofa and chairs. The room and bathroom were huge. There were 2 bottles of complimentary water and welcome chocolates. As H10 members we also got a voucher for a welcome cocktail each so its worth joining. There was also an amenity pack in the bathroom containing toothbrushes and toothpaste etc. Breakfast was included and enjoyable with breads, cereals and pastries together with a selection of freshly cooked options available. As a Brit who loves a good cup of tea, unfortunately the tea was awful so I recommend taking some tea bags with you! The hotel is very close to Diagonal metro station which made getting around the city very easy. We managed to visit nearly all the main sites just using our T10 cards.

203,"My husband and I stayed here for two nights last weekend on our first trip to Barcelona and the only downside was that our stay wasn’t long enough. From the moment we checked in, with a glass of complimentary Cava, the service and facilities were exceptional. All staff we encountered were lovely and professional and nothing was too much. We stayed in room 302, a classic twin facing the road; however it was the equivalent of a king size bed, with a small balcony, and the road noise was minimal - I slept really well. The room was beautiful and clean, with sangria in the room and still water replenished during our stay, and lovely toiletries provided.As suggested by a previous reviewer, I signed up to the loyalty scheme beforehand and we were given a free cocktail, which we had on our first night (mine a scrummy Cosmopolitan and my husband a Pina Colada). We took these to the roof terrace which was very quiet given it was January, but it was mild so we enjoyed the sight of La Pedrera lit up in the evening - there is a bar on the terrace in warmer months, so I can imagine it would be a great place to spend an evening.We didn’t eat at the hotel, or use the pools as it was way too cold, so I can’t comment on these. My husband did book a ‘romance pack’ though for €25 for my birthday, so we came back from our day out to a chilled bottle of Cava and dessert from the kitchen (dipped chocolate strawberries, macaroons and chocolates) which was a lovely touch.Overall this hotel was faultless, and when we return to Barcelona one day (which we absolutely will) I wouldn’t want to stay anywhere else.

Thanks José!Our room was a nice size and mostly well-designed. We appreciated the photos of the original building, prior to the hotel renovation. Be careful in the bathroom, as the sinks are prone to splashing water everywhere and the water temperature fluctuates quite a bit in the shower.Unfortunately, there were a few things that soured our stay. After we dropped off our things in our room, we wandered down to the lobby to top up our cava glasses at the nicely decorated “Welcome!” table in the guest area of the lobby. As soon as we touched the bottle, a woman behind a check-in desk walked over and asked what we were doing. When we explained, she told us complementary drinks are only for welcoming new guests, and we’d need to now pay at the bar. The hotel needs to bring the drink bar behind the check-in desks and remove guest signage if they intend for it to be used by staff only. Also, train your staff. At €150+/night, it’s just not worth an embarrassing guest experience to save the partial glass of cava.So, we left our glasses and set out to quickly check out the property. Our first stop was the rooftop terrace, which looks incredible in hotel pictures. It was deserted, heat lamps shut off with no staff around to turn them on, and caution tape sloppily hung around what had been the rooftop dunk pool, which now sits empty and unkept. Bummer.Later that day, we took a great walking tour and our guide cringed and kindly told us we wouldn’t find great Catalan food or really anything “truly Barcelona” near our hotel — just designer retail and tourist traps. After a few days in the city, our experience proved him right. There are plenty of charming hotels much nearer the Gothic quarter and all the action of Ciutat Vella and surrounding neighborhoods. Casa Mimosa is just a block from La Pedrera and a 15-20min walk to La Sagrada Família, but otherwise it’s the center of luxury shopping on Las Ramblas. We spent 20-30min each morning and evening just walking to the more historic, vibrant parts of the city.We loved Barcelona and we’ll be back as soon as we can, but we won’t be returning to Casa Mimosa. I’m surprised the hotel is as highly rated as it is on TripAdvisor.","January 28, 2019","3    H10 Casa Mimosa

206,"We have tried a large number of hotels in Barcelona and asked to see the rooms in many more. There are a few other good hotels, but with each there is a location problem, at least for us: too intermixed with lower Las Ramblas, too far from the fun areas like upper Las Ramblas, chain like, modern and boring with no style, too dark and kind of creepy with tiny windows, low standards, etc. No, we are not easy, just the way it is. We actually were not going to go to Barcelona last June due to no desirable hotel but discovered Casa Mimosa and decided to give it a try even though it looked too good to be true.But it was true - just as it appears in the photos and the positive reviews and perfectly located in the Eixample, the hidden-in-plain-sight high end yet hip and fun area in Barcelona surrounded by great cafes and a few good restaurants (For the best you usually need a taxi from everywhere.) ....and without the teeming masses and constantly instinctively gripping my handbag.  We liked our modern but still fine room, a Classic terrace room on the 6th floor, but were in shock when we opened the curtains to find not just a lovely terrace with a sofa and table and a planted separator, but as we raised our gaze we saw that we had a full view of Gaudi's Casa Mila. The roof was the same height as our terrace and between its large building and our's was a large sort of piaca below. We never wanted to leave that terrace, but had to visit the hotel's great rooftop area, complete with sand and trees and beautiful. Don't even think of staying elsewhere. Now I can return to what I sat down to do: reserve a room for June. Love Barcelona and now love a hotel there.","January 22, 2019","3    H10 Casa Mimosa

207,"Stayed at the H10 Casa Mimosa hotel in Barcelona for my husbands birthday and enjoyed our stay. Lovely spacious modern room and the staff were very helpful. They even remembered my husbands birthday and presented him with a bottle of cava and small chocolate cake, nice touch thank you so much. The hotel is central and close to some of Gaudi’s stunning buildings. We didn’t eat at the hotel because there were many local coffee shops and restaurants that to be honest worked out cheaper than breakfast. The metro was 5 mins away and very easy to use. Would definitely stay here again.","January 16, 2019","3    H10 Casa Mimosa

From the moment you walk in to the lobby, everything is perfect, the decor is beautiful, the staff is very friendly, and there is even a selection of beverages (cava, sparkling water, etc) made available. The room itself was amazing, with a nice balcony, some of the best views of La Pedrera available in the city, and complementary sangria upon arrival. Everything inside the room was clean, modern, and put together, making it a wonderful place to return to each evening. We stayed here for New Year's Eve, the following evening, and then again two weeks later, prior to returning to the US. The staff here could not be any kinder, and truly helped make my first stay in Barcelona an excellent one.

210,"Lovely hotel I totally recommend. Understated but comfortable public area and bar. The bedroom was quite minimalist (but fine) and quite large with a super king bed. Linens were crisp and fresh. The bathroom was modern and quite large (no bath though!). The room we had was 509 and it was really quiet with shutters to keep the noise out. The staff were excellent. Lots of helpful advice on sightseeing and restaurants especially from Alla and Noah - local tapas restaurants recommended were excellent: Vivo and Bar Mut both within a short walk. The hotel was very clean and well maintained. As it was the winter we didn’t use the roof pool nor the terrace but I imagine in the summer we would do. Welcome drinks on arrival was a nice touch and as we had signed up for the loyalty program to get a 5% discount ahead of time we also got a free cocktail each. Complimentary water in the room. My only issue was the breakfast is buffet only and at €23 per Head was a bit steep as all I needed was a coffee and croissant. This was solved by eating at the cafe opposite ( El Fornet)where we had 2 fresh croissants, a large glass of freshly squeezed OJ, a large Danish pastry, a bowl of fruit and 2 cappuccinos for €19. Despite this I wouldn’t hesitate to stay here again.","January 5, 2019","3    H10 Casa Mimosa

The communication from the hotel prior to staying was brilliant, and everything was taken care of for our arrival.First impressions of the hotel when we got there was that it was a classy, beautiful and modern with a contemporary twist.Raul on Reception checked us in with a friendly and cheerful personality, and was very happy to help us with any information that we needed.We requested a room with a balcony and we got one, even though they couldn’t guarantee it!!Our room was stylish and elegantly designed, with absolutely everything you would need (and more).It was my wife’s birthday and they had very thoughtfully left us a bottle of Cava and some delicious ginger cake as a celebration!!We checked out the rooftop pool straight away, and it’s a perfect place to chill out and relax with views over the local Eixample area.The hotel is a great location to walk to the local Gaudi sites, shopping etc...and has loads of local Tapas bars to choose from, it’s ideal for exploring and is walkable to Place De Catalunya and Las Ramblas.We asked Amelia on Reception for advice on the best way to get to places, like Parc Güell, and she was only to happy to help us, as she was throughout our stay. She’s a real superstar employee and personified what the hotel is all about - friendly, helpful, happy and relaxed.On check out, we had Amelia helping us, and as we were leaving at 6:00am the next morning, she sorted everything out including a taxi which was waiting for us and a little picnic, as we would be missing breakfast. It was lovely and it’s these little extra details, done with a genuine care that sets the hotel apart from many others we have stayed at across Europe.Honestly, with so many hotels to choose from in Barca, you don’t need to search any further, this is the one for you.If you want a perfectly located, modern with character/style, great food, rooms, service with a great pool - book this now.I’ve just left and travelling home but we’re already planning our return to The Corner Hotel!!

We were upgraded to a big room and a bottle of champagne was left for us cooling in an ice bucket which was a lovely touch. The rooms are so nicely decorated, just so clean and modern. And the bed was the comfiest we've ever slept on.. my boyfriend even wanted to take it home! The bathroom was well equipped and very clean. There was a safe and fridge available too if needed. There's also a rooftop pool which looked amazing but too cold when we went!!On the ground floor where reception is, there's a quiet bar which did amazing cocktails. The hotel staff were so polite and friendly and nothing was too much trouble for them, very quick to answer questions and give information about the local area.

There is much needed iced water in reception on arrival.The hotel is further from the centre than I would have normally liked, this wouldn’t be an issue normally but the obscenely high temperatures this weekend made it impossible to walk much.The room was lovely with effective air conditioning and lovely facilities.Breakfast was a lovely spread with plenty of options.

When I received the confirmation via email, it had the wrong dates on the reservation. More shocking, rather than three nights, The Corner Hotel/Agoda had me reserved for 14 nights. They charged me a whopping US $3742.54. I immediately cancelled that reservation and made a new one. Agoda advised me that my first reservation was non-cancelable and that I would be charged the full US $3742.54. I tried to find the Agoda customer service number on the website (they don't show one on their website), but through a Google search I found a telephone number. When I reached Agoda customer service, which was an ""English-as-a-second-language"" service, the agent agreed to contact the hotel for me.

Among the hotel’s numerous amenities is a clean and secure car park that was quite a surprise and much appreciated. We also had a wonderfully satisfying meal in the restaurant/bar after a long day exploring the city. The staff at the front desk, who quickly attended to all of our requests, exceeded all expectations. No need to search further - this is a great hotel and you won’t be disappointed.

242,"We had a great time at the hotel. The reception and bar staff go out of their way to help. There is a great atmosphere in the lounge area with live music at times. The music around the hotel does get quite annoying after a while as it is of a particular genre and some very strange songs! However if you know what you’re doing you can play your own music through the system in your room. We had a corner room which was lovely with a modern feel. The bathroom however was a bit of a disappointment as it was a wet room with a plastic shower curtain. Not quite what we expected and it meant the bathroom floor was soaked each day and we used towels to mop it up otherwise you couldn’t walk in there as it didn’t drain away well. The cleaners did a great job for which we were very thankful. The roof top area is great and quite quiet at this time of year. A lovely place to sit and enjoy some peace or to have a drink in the sun after a busy day out. The breakfast was great and beautifully presented. Available from 7am to 11am. There could be more space to put your plates to allow you to dish your food and spare cutlery in case you need it, as we did every day. There was nowhere for rubbish or teabags either. Just small things but worth mentioning. The breakfast staff need to smile and be more present around the room to assist people. There were several people trying to work out how to use things and find things. It would be nice if there was someone to help. The above did not detract from our stay and we would return to the hotel again. It is in a great spot with lots of different restaurants and bars close by. Try the pizzeria opposite the entrance and the Indian curry bar Masala 73. Also The Venue steak house but that’s a taxi cab away. The main sights are half an hours walk away but we got a few taxis and they’re very reasonable. The roads are superb and the city is so clean. We were very impressed with all it had to offer from the parks to the beaches and history. What a wonderful city and we will go again. ","May 22, 2019","4    The Corner Hotel

Great location for access to surrounding La Rambla shopping and El Raval and Gothic Quarter restaurants and nightlife. Staff is friendly and accommodating. In terms of amenities, there is not a gym or office area. However, the downstairs lobby/bar seem to be a local hangout for students and business people alike due to beautiful interior design/free Wi-Fi, and food/coffee. An added bonus was free yoga once a week on the rooftop. There is a pool and bar on the rooftop, too. Rooms are clean, on smaller side, but it's Europe!

Having previously stayed in the Eixample area when visiting Barcelona, we were happy to stay in this vicinity and the reviews for The Corner were amazing - we were not disappointed! It is a good 20 min walk from La Ramblas but its a leisurely stroll and plenty to see on the way - easy to get to most places.The service at the hotel was brilliant - they were able to check us in early when we arrived and when we got back to our room they had left a bottle of cava and some amazing chocolate cake to celebrate our anniversary (I had mentioned when booking). This was such a nice gesture and we took the bottle up to the roof terrace which was an amazing place to enjoy the setting sun and relax.We had a few drinks and snacks in the bar, all of which were very reasonably priced and very good. Service again was great.We had a superior room and it was a good size for 2, comfortable bed and the pillows were amazing!! There was a pillow menu on the bedside table. Bathroom was lovely, great shower and toiletries and the wardrobe was huge.All in all I cannot say enough about this hotel and wouldn't hesitate to recommend to anyone.","May 17, 2019","4    The Corner Hotel

But will definitely need a cab back at the end of the day if you end up at gothic area or la rambla side.Ground floor is like a co-working space. Modern looking spacious room, clean, and friendly staffs! Ask for recommendations at the reception as they are mostly reliable. Diagonally opposite to the hotel has a delicious Catalunya cuisine. Down the street towards Gaudi’s masterpiece there is a burger place that is packed at night. Laundramat is also nearby if you need to do some washing.","May 16, 2019","4    The Corner Hotel

First thing we noticed was what a stylish and modern hotel it is; the lobby has a bar/ cafe which we spent quite a few mornings and late nights relaxing in as did many other residents and locals. Room was very clean and modern, bed huge and extremely comfortable. Best part about the whole trip was the customer service- particularly Marten (sp?) Nothing was too much and he went above and beyond when we were pick pocketed on the metro, helping us report and with the police report etc. His kindness really made the trip for us. Hotel is a fair walk from the centre (20 minutes from Las Ramblas and around 1 hour from the beach) but the buses are cheap and very quick as is the metro. There are good restaurants nearby so no need to head back into the centre every evening. A nice touch was being welcomed into the hotel with a different free drink every evening from rose to cocktails! Would definitely stay here again.","April 20, 2019","4    The Corner Hotel

When my room was ready, it was worth the wait.I booked a superior room so it had a huge bed and a beautiful balcony. Shower is powerful. Wish i had a bath.Staff are excellent and very friendly.The atmosphere and food in the bar downstairs are both very enjoyable. Breakfast has loads to choose from. Really enjoyed the breads, cheese and fruits. It was very quiet as well which is a nice change from the breakfast madness in hotels at home.I highly recommend this hotel.

The location is a bit out of the hub bub of the city action but close enough to walk.This is a convention hotel - when I say this, that is who they cater to. I walked in every night at midnight, asking for Ice in a glass to take to my room. There was a corporate party going on blocked by barriers. The front desk told me to walk in and get it.... I was shocked. Typically, they say, I will send it to your room. He pointed to the party, continued chatting with his friend and said -"" Go ask the Bar.""The room was nice - but again, they had a hard time replacing coffee, cream or used cups. I will not stay here again.... I suggest you don't. I LOVE the H10 METROPOLITAN!!!!","March 27, 2019","5    H10 Art Gallery

280,"We came in the hotel for one night, we were upgraded to the Junior Suite as it was available and we were only staying for a Night.The room was perfect: Large bubble bathtub, rain shower, giant comfy bed, living room area and very luminous ! Insonorisation is perfect as we did not hear a thing once in the room. Only thing is that the room has no balcony.Staff is very friendly and breakfast is good.One of the best point of the hotel is that it is super well located ! You are at walking distance of many point of interest in Barcelona.I would absolutely come back to the hotel.Quentin","March 19, 2019","5    H10 Art Gallery

281,"I stayed here for 4 nights and absolutely loved it! First of all we noticed that the location is fab with it only being a 5 minute walk away from the diagonal/provença metro station which gives you access to every part of Barcelona if you don’t want to walk, and ensures you don’t have to lug your suitcase for miles when going to and from the airport. When checking in we were greeted by lovely and helpful staff who gave us a welcome drink which you choose from juice, champagne or water, and are given a map of the city as well as a leaflet for the hop on hop off bus tour. The room was a good size, very modern and clean with a very comfy bed and huge shower of good quality! The whole stay we kept getting surprised with the lovely small touches by the staff which go a long way, for example when we returned from a day in the city we were greeted with chocolates and cookies on our bed, we got free crisps when drinking at the bar and we got a free drink each at the bar for becoming h10 member which costs nothing to join! The breakfast was gorgeous with a continental range of breads, yoghurts, meats and cereals etc, and then you could order hot food from a menu. We tried pretty much everything over the 4 days including crepes, scrambled and poached eggs, bacon, mushrooms and beans, and we weren’t disappointed with any of the dishes. Everything was cooked fresh, tasted lovely and was presented very well. Overall I cannot recommend this hotel enough and we are definitely going to look out for these hotels when booking anywhere again. ","March 12, 2019","5    H10 Art Gallery

In a so called 4 star hotels, I wouldn’t expect to have to call the front desk to get toilet paper or soap, as there was none after cleaning (more than once). I also would not expect a “you must go downstairs to get your bottle of wine openned” response. All in all, It was way below expectation, nothing really stood out as really good.

286,"We spent a week at the H10 Art Gallery hotel in Barcelona.Overall our experience was great. The room was small, but we only went in to sleep and shower since Barcelona is such a wonderful city. The other minimal amount of time we spent at the hotel was at the rooftop pool, which was very nice and offered great views. Get there early if you want to get a good spot though as it is kind of small up there.The hotel was located in a fairly quiet area, away from much of the hustle of Las Ramblas. Taxi stand right out front and a metro stop a block away. We chose this hotel specifically on price, which was great. Since we planned to explore the city alot, we didn't require anything fancy, but this hotel went above our expectations. The employees were very nice and the hotel was very clean. The bathroom in the room was also very nice.We did alot of walking and came back some nights very late and never felt as if the area around the hotel was unsafe. Next time we might try to stay a little closer to a more ""major"" area, but if you don't mind walking a few extra blocks, this hotel is great.","January 18, 2019","5    H10 Art Gallery

289,"We stayed here for one night before going back home. We wanted something decent / economical for our last night in Spain since we had an early flight the next morning. The staff was really nice, and offered Champagne during check-in. I believe breakfast was 15 or 16 Euros which is not that expensive for a hotel. However, I recommend eating outside at a cafe where breakfast typically run 7 to 8 Euros. This hotel is only a few blocks away from Passeig de Gràcia (high end shopping and access to the train.)Overall it was a nice hotel, but the rooms are small.

291,"Would not recommend for a business trip. I was in a superior room, which was okay, but I wonder how basic the normal rooms were. The desk was very small, the Wi-fi in the room slow (faster in the bar) and not a proper chair to sit and work at.Service was mediocre the entire time across the entire hotel. The bathroom venting didn’t seem to do anything other than letting the essence of cigarette smoke come in to your bathroom periodically. On my second night I returned to find the voile curtain had been removed, which meant you had to leave the curtains closed in the morning as you would have no privacy. The following day two mismatched ones were installed in their place, but they didn’t fit so left a 30cm gap between them as they were too small; in essence same problem. They had fixed the large window that had a gap large enough to put fingers through, which on the first night I had to pack with tissue paper to reduce the external noise and breeze.Odd lighting situation, where the bedside light worked off the main switch so if you wanted that on you had to have the main ceiling lights on. I did enjoy the welcome glass of cava while checking in though. As of November 2018 there is construction going on next door which seemed to work through the night which while not massively noisy did disturb me. Rooms are small, barely enough room to do a cramped yoga session in the morning. I wouldn’t go back because of these things.","November 30, 2018","5    H10 Art Gallery

292,"Really surprises me that both the reviews and hotel website fail to mention there is a major construction project next door and it is VERY LOUD. Upgraded (and paid more) for a room to face Enric Granados as the interior room was very claustrophobic. The street view room was viewed at lunch and it was quiet b/c the construction was on break. Was awakened quite early the following morning to jack hammers, drills, etc. It would have been nice if the staff had informed of this.Note the interior rooms are quite small and no privacy due to the nature of the window facing the elevator courtyard and all other rooms. It might be good for one night but not for a longer period.The hotel is at a good location, amenities as stated, etc. The breakfast is extensive with eggs and hot dishes made to order, pastries, bread, charcuterie, cheeses, fruit, juices and coffee.In the end cannot recommend staying here due to the very loud construction.","November 20, 2018","5    H10 Art Gallery

293,"Stayed here for 2 nights as a group of 4 friends. We received a voucher on check in for a free cocktail to redeem in the hotel bar which was a nice touch. We had an internal room, which I was worried about as I have stayed in hotels before where you are looking at a brick wall, but this was nice as you had a door that opened onto a courtyard so it didn’t feel claustrophobic. The hotel is in a nice spot with a good choice of popular bars and restaurants on your doorstep, but it’s a lovely leafy quiet area. About a 15 min walk to Sagrada Família and other sights. Breakfast had a decent selection, can’t complain for what you got, as it was included in the price. Room was a decent size with a coffee machine and docking station and enough wardrobe space. Good bathroom amenities and a lovely shower and a great feature where a little light comes on when you walk in, which is great for the middle of the night not having to search for the light switch. My only complaint about the hotel, which did have an impact on my weekend was the bathroom door!! What a terrible design! It’s a frosted glass door, but it has at least a 1 inch gap where it is hinged so when it’s closed you can see right through. This wasn’t just our door, as our fiends door was the same and that’s the way it’s been fitted. You could hear and see everything, which when you are away with a friend it makes it quite awkward! That is the only reason I wouldn’t give the hotel 5 stars as it really was a hindrance. ","November 19, 2018","5    H10 Art Gallery

295,"We spent four nights in the H10 Art Gallery. Overall I would say that, for what we paid for, it was good value for money. The room, even though it was small and quite limited space, was really clean and well maintained each day by housekeeping. Fresh, modern interior and a nice bathroom with a really good shower. The bed was very comfortable. It has a lovely rooftop pool area which was perfect for chilling in the sun in the afternoon. Location wise, we felt it was well placed in terms of accessibility to all main tourist attractions. We could get to Las Ramblas in 15 minutes easily. We were able to get to all the various tourist attractions and areas of the city on foot, but close by are metro stations and bus stops. The only negative would be the breakfast. There was a small selection of cereals, fruits, toast/croissants etc and you had the option to order from a small menu. We were quite surprised that when we ordered scrambled eggs on toast, we were presented with a small, thin, disc of bread with some egg piled on top. It looked like it was trying to mimic some kind of fine dining. Not really necessary for breakfast. The restaurant manager had a bad attitude and was not welcoming at all.

The little issues we found was that on the bedding there was a huge stain on one of the quilts, we left bed unmade next morning with the stain on show and after the room was cleaned checked and it was still there we took it off the bed and left a note to replace they just took it away . Sunday when we stayed took ages we left the room numerous times waiting for it to be cleaned we had no towels , no shower gel , and clean cups , coffee , water . We went down to reception at 3pm and asked and said they would send cleaning up st 4.15pm we rang down to say nothing has arrived , they arrived about 10 mins after that call but couldn’t do much as we didn’t have the facility to anything within the room and had to wait all day pretty much .

301,"We booked the hotel on booking.com but cancelled it after seeing the added value of booking directly to the hotel (free breakfast, cheaper price, free WiFi). In the end we still paid 150 EUR for a deluxe room with terrace, which isn't too bad for an August in Barcelona, but certainly not cheap either.We arrived at the hotel late at night, and weren't offered a welcome drink. At the reservation I made 2 requests: a double bed and a quiet room. Unfortunately we were given a tiny room, directly opposite the elevator which was poorly maintained. When I complained about this, the reception said that all the rooms with double beds and terrace were directly opposite the elevator; luckly the manager ""found"" a room a little further away from the elevator the next day. It was quieter than the first room, so well appreciated. The room similarly showed signs of damage: wall paper torn and stained.Be careful and know that all the rooms are extremely tiny. You cannot open 2 large suitcase in the room. There is only 1 small chair to sit on. The bathroom was OK in size, clean, with a good shower. However, they have annoying lights with sensors that go on an off if someone uses the bathroom at night, causing the other person to wake up. The best aspect of the room was the terrace and the location of the hotel in Eixample: plenty of restaurants and bars very close to the hotel. Don't rent the bicycles of the hotel (20 EUR/bike/day); there are cheaper options a few blocks away. I don't understand why they don't give the bikes for free use... The small pool on the roof of the hotel was nice as well.Breakfast is decent but if it weren't included in the room rate, I wouldn't pay extra for it.The main reason why I won't return is when we got to the room on our 3rd day, the room was made up, but the bed sheet showed a large stain (dried up blood? Melted chocolate? Who knows...) which is completely unaccepable. I went down to the reception and asked them to change the linen while we went out for dinner. 2 hours later we came back and found that nothing had changed. I returned to the reception and 15 min later they sent housekeeping who changed the sheets. No apology was offered at any time. Totally and completely unaccaptable. The small size of the room was a disappointment but my fault (I should have researched better); the unprofessional housekeeping is something I cannot tolerate. There are better options available at that price.","September 2, 2018","5    H10 Art Gallery

312,"We absolutely loved this hotel, the staff here are fantastic and really care about its guests. We arrived around 10am but check in wasn’t til 3 but we were greeted with a choice of drinks and given maps and directions and they took our bags to store. The hotel is in a lovely area with a great selection of places to eat and drink and close to main attractions.When we came back around 4pm our rooms weren’t ready and we had to wait in the lobby for around 15 mins however for this “inconvenience “ we were given a voucher for 2 free cocktails in the bar.The rooms here are small but perfectly formed and there are very nice “Rituals” toiletries in the bathroom. Although this is a very popular hotel in a good location, it never felt crowded. While on our last day my wife fell over and was quite poorly, the staff on reception did everything to get us to the best hospital. It was also the day we had to check out but once again they came to the rescue finding the best price for another room on their website instead of just putting us on the rack rate.They also liaised with a supplier to get her a wheelchair when she came out of hospital - I couldn’t have thanked them enough!We had room service that night - just a club sandwich but it was tasty and flavoursome and not bad price for room service at 9.50€ - it came with a huge bowl of crisps.The breakfast here though was amazing - get the rate including breakfast as it will last you through lunch and all the way to dinner. Check my pictures but it doesn’t do it justice.... the bespoke omelettes are to die for!Planning another trip to Barcelona next year but will only stay here!! ","July 10, 2018","5    H10 Art Gallery

314,Very nice hotel in good central location.Just a little disappointed with the room size. We had the internal facing room and it's not big enough for two suitcases without having to step over them.Rooftop pool was nice but also small and gets crowded with just a handful of people.The outside beer garden is really nice and a good place for a cocktail and to get away form the bustling centre of Barcelona.Would stay again but on an outward facing room with balcony. But maybe the price will go up and there would be better options?,"July 1, 2018","5    H10 Art Gallery

318,"Stayed at this hotel a week ago for 4 nights on the 3rd floor facing the street. The room was fantastic, service wonderful especially Victor on front desk.Returned yesterday for an overnight stay and did not receive a warm welcome at check in. Went to my allocated room only to discover it was a disabled room. The shower did not have an enclosure and consequently water would have covered the floor, the floor surface is already slippery. When I returned to reception, the gentleman knew that he had allocated me a disabled room, wish he had told me before I went to the room, he did apologise. I requested another room, Hotel was at capacity and I was allocated room 107. This was a very small room, and I mean small, facing an internal atrium, you can’t open the curtains as you look directly into another room, hence no natural light. Very disappointed. I really rated this hotel on my first visit as the room and staff were lovely, on this overnight stay I have been very disappointed, even considered changing hotels. Sadly, I am not sure about a return visit.","June 7, 2018","5    H10 Art Gallery

319,"Hotel was clean and staff friendly . Due to a flight cancellation we missed a night there but were charged 190 Euros for a *no Show "". We booked through Booking.com and advised them as soon as we were aware of the problem . We were advised that it was Hotel's policy and it was suggested that we claim back from Airline. ( that is still in progress) Frankly I feel a little disappointed and would just make travellers aware of this policy. Generally not in my opinion the best location for a city break but perhaps depends on what you want to do in the City. I am unlikely to return there and now have an issue with H10 hotels and their charging policy . Their short sighted approach to an unavoidable delay has resulted in this review , whereas a more helpful an understanding view , looking at the big picture might have provided a less negative view.

322,"L'Eixample is the most convenient place to stay in Barcelona, and Enric Granados Street is one of the quietest avenues. This H10 hotel is on a street with only 1 lane of traffic, with trees and ample pedestrian walking areas. Many good restaurants are within a couple of blocks. Two major metro stops are within 3 or 4 blocks. From an itinerary planning standpoint, this is an excellent location. The reviews you read in Trip Advisor are accurate, however -- the rooms are, in fact, small. That shouldn't matter if you are running around on business or on vacation. The bed was comfortable, and that's basically all that matters. (Of course, we booked the room at a good price, and that makes the cramped quarters more bearable.) It took us a while to figure out how the A/C system works. Our room opened into an interior courtyard, so it was usually too warm to leave the windows open. The bathroom was adequately sized and modern. Each floor of the hotel is decorated in the style of a different artist (we were on the 5th Floor, which reflects the work of Roy Lichtenstein). The staff was helpful. The rooftop pool was a bit cool but refreshing for dangling our feet in the water after a long day of walking.","April 30, 2018","5    H10 Art Gallery

We got a 3 day HOLA card which allows you to use on bus & metro & the metro even takes you to the airport so you’re all set for 18 euros each. Bargain. Citymapper helped lots, could use on our EE normal data package. The hotel was comfortable, so clean, little luxury details from bathroom range to treats by lobby. Service was always friendly they held our luggage after checkout as we had time to explore before return flight. As it was over Valentines Day we came back to a champagne bottle & chocolates on day 2. So sweet. Rooftop terrace has pool & views of city with a bar!

326,"I just got back from Barcelona where we stayed at the H10 Madison for two nights prior to our cruise. This beautiful boutique hotel is located in the Barri Gotic section of the city and exactly 1 block from the Barcelona Cathedral. The amazing location, gorgeous lobby, spotless, large room and enormous bathroom (we stayed in a junior suite), rooftop pool & bar with breathtaking views of this magical city are just a few things I wanted to mention. It is the perfect place to stay. However, the real gem is the friendly staff and impeccable service this hotel provides. Pedro and Naima went ABOVE AND BEYOND for us....before, during and even after our stay. They are two of the loveliest people I have ever met. My daughter had accidentally left a pair of new Nike Air Force One sneakers in the room after we checked out. I had called the hotel after boarding the cruise to see if they found them, which they had and Naima told me they would be happy to hold the sneakers for me to pick up upon our return from our cruise. When we went back to get the sneakers, hauling all of our luggage with us, they were kind enough to hold our bags until we needed to depart for the airport so that we could go out and explore the city, shop, eat lunch...all without having to lug our bags around. Pedro offered us refreshments, allowed us to relax in the air conditioned lobby, called a taxi to take us to the airport and helped bring our bags to the cab when it arrived. They welcomed us back with open arms, even though we weren't checking in again and this was an enormous kindness we will never forget. Please know that a hotel is NOTHING without its staff and your employees are THE BEST people I have ever encountered in the hospitality business. Bravo H10 Madison!!","July 9, 2019","6    H10 Madison

327,"My husband, our 2 boys age 9 and 12, and I stayed here for 2 nights before a cruise out of Barcelona. This hotel was perfect. It’s more of a boutique hotel and very modern. Didn’t feel like a chain. Perfect location. You can walk to a bunch of sights and just wander around the Gothic Quarter and La Rambla during the day and night. We hailed a taxi right in front of the hotel to take us to Sagrada Família (book your tickets online). The front desk staff helped us book tickets to the FCA Barca Camp Nau (which my son wanted to see) and they also helped us get a taxi to the cruise port, and booked our hotel transfer from the airport. The staff spoke English which was helpful. We stayed in a suite, which worked for us. I emailed the hotel ahead of time and they helped me book it. Our view was of an alley and residential balconies, seemed pretty quiet. Surprisingly, however, at 11:45 pm on Friday night a local neighbor set of fireworks off the rooftop right next to our room window. Kind of interesting/cool/festive. It was LGTBQ pride parade weekend so maybe it was just celebratory fireworks, not sure if it’s the norm. My son went in the rooftop pool while husband and I had a drink up there. They provide bathrobes in the rooms, which my son wore up to the roof, so the experience had a spa-like feel. Pool is small but a good place to rest and relax for about an hour or so. Awesome photo opp of the cathedral. My only complaint is the rooftop drink/food service was awkwardly slow. Breakfast was excellent, and the food service was top notch. Complimentary water and espresso machine in the room was nice, too. it was really a great way to start our vacation. I wish we had stayed there in Barcelona a couple more nights.

The rooms are large by European standards, and the rainfall shower was so enveloping I might have stayed under it all day and missed all the delicious jamon (luckily I extricated myself from the shower eventually). Staff at the restaurant is terrific - efficient and friendly.  I did have two issues at the hotel. The first was a smaller issue with the cleanliness of the bathroom. The second was a significant customer service issue upon our departure. However, after I reported this issue to the hotel, I was contacted by the front desk manager, Rodolphe Pottier, who was extremely kind and accommodating, assuring me the employee at issue had been made aware of the issue and that they were working to improve the service. My interactions with Mr. Pottier were very positive and have caused me to rewrite my review to upgrade it to five stars.

The room, beds, shower and balcony were perfect with and we even had a very nice view at the Cathedral. But the thing that makes this hotel different from a lots of other hotels is the service! For the service I would say 11/10, each one of them gives you the perfect feeling, from the manager to the waiter to the cleaning lady to ... They were all unbelievable competent.","June 10, 2019","6    H10 Madison

348,"Yes, H10 may be a chain, and that often leads to a purely commercial approach to the hospitality product - but not here - this is a hotel with personality, as well as world class quality. Reception - fab, room - fab, breakfast - fab, location - fab, rooftop terrace - fab, housekeeping - fab. But ultimately its the staff who make or break a hotel - and here the staff are absolutely splendid - always smiling, always willing to talk and to listen, always helpful. Loved our stay.

351,"Stayed in a Junior Suite for a week.Arrival was excellent - porter attended as soon as we got out the taxi and took luggage.Bubbly or water on arrival and staff were all excellent during our stay and very friendly.Room was very nice.I like to see the surroundings from any room i stay in and when i drew the nets back i was shocked at the disgusting ugly view of in your face scruffy terraces from apartments next door.Not good.We also had quite a lot of noise from Spanish kids out on their balconies which ruined a few afternoons rest.No drawers in the room.This is bad and needs putting right.I have stayed in 1 Star hotels and had ample drawers.Lovely large bathroom and rain forest shower,Room was serviced very well by staff.Air conditioning was a nuisance as it kept turning off due to the French door not closing properly.You had to get it just right before it worked or bang and push the door firmly shut.Some noise a few nights from the room above.Footsteps for over an hour ! maybe they were line dancing ? sounded like it.Free safe in the room .Two lifts in the hotel both very small and seem to have a mind of their own.Very slow.Lovely rooftop terrace and small pool.Great views.It rained for a few days which wets the seats so even when the sun has come out and they look dry they are not !Main restaurant was shut most nights which was a shame.I do not like sitting outside to eat when the weathers not great so i feel that facility was not there.Breakfast was very nice.Plenty of choice and they do wait on you at the table.I dont like eating off black plates ! white ones would be better and no lettuce garnish with egg and bacon ! One morning service was very bad.Over 30 mins wait for my order and no croissants either.Waitress said 5 minutes in oven.Half an hour later i asked again and was told 5 minutes more in oven ! They eventually were served and were cold ! so i dont think they had been in any oven.My breakfast order was wrong so after a 30 min wait i had to wait again for the correct order to be served.Pity this happened.Hotel is a lovely building and been open a year.Last night when we went back to the room there was a bottle of bubbly on ice and a plate of strawberries dipped in chocolate.We had not ordered this so rang reception just to make sure what it was and we were told its for us on the house so a lovely gesture.The female receptionist had arranged this so many thanks.Sorry i didnt get her name.All i know is that she is from the Philippines.So despite the spoilers i would fully recommend staying here.","May 31, 2019","6    H10 Madison

But, more than anything else, it’s the service provided by the staff which goes above & beyond the call of duty. I was unfortunate enough to have a serious fall in a neighbouring restaurant, cracking two ribs [the doctor thinks]. Their care & kindness were outstanding, just amazing.

355,"We spent the weekend of the 17th to 20th May in Barcelona, having visited once before on a Cruise stop off we wanted to explore this beautiful city. Having spent many hours searching through lists of hotels online, we kept coming back to the H10 Madison and decided this was the one for us.What a fabulous choice! The staff are extremely pleasant and nothing is to much trouble, there is coffee machine provided in the room, but being a typical Brit I just wanted a cup of tea, no problem, a kettle and tea were provided without any issue.The rooms are lovely, nice big comfortable beds with high quality products supplied, even a small bag containing toothbrush and shaver are supplied for those who do not want to carry toiletries through the airport. Cleanliness of the whole hotel is to a high level and maintained at that standard 24/7.We did have a couple of nights of rain whilst in Barcelona, umbrellas were available from reception if you chose to brave the weather. I can however highly recommend the hotel bar for a great night with wonderful staff who can make any cocktail you desire, or even ones you have never tried before. We were entertained with these skills by the wonderful Andrea and Miguel, very talented and professional team H10, we hope to see them both there next time we visit.We are really looking forward to a return visit and hope to spend more time on the rooftop pool area, to enjoy the stunning views, weather permitting.","May 26, 2019","6    H10 Madison

356,"Best hotel I have stayed in!We have just returned from a 2 night stay in the H10 Madison, what can I say other than the staff make this the best hotel my husband has ever stayed in, and he spends 20 weeks of the year in them around the world. Everyone we have come into contact with has been exceptional, from check in, to the bar on the roof, breakfast and the pool guy, we couldn’t have asked for more! The hotel is very central, easy access to everything you would want to do. The breakfast had an amazing amount of choice, plus a menu of cooked to order options. You could add a glass of champagne to it as well!The menu on the roof terrace was varied and well priced, the Caesar salad was very good. We tried to work our way through the gins on offer but ran out of time!If there’s anything slightly negative to say it’s, ask for a room with a view ( the internal courtyard isn’t that pretty ) we booked a double room, and ended up with two singles pushed together ( made up as singles, not a double ) and while the complimentary Nespresso machine is a lovely touch for coffee drinkers, the lack of a kettle left me without an option for the tea I always carry. Think the bathroom window could do with some sort of blind as well, with the light on I imagine you are sharing more than you bargained for with the neighbours! Even with these small things I would be back for another stay in a heartbeat, and would throughly recommend to anyone. It’s a credit to the brand. ","May 23, 2019","6    H10 Madison

362,"I’m not usually one to write reviews but felt we had to here! Just returned home from a 5 night stay and received exceptional service throughout, we had a lovely double room on the seventh floor which was serviced by a very efficient cleaning team. Loved the double rainfall shower! We were greeted with a bottle of cava and birthday cake to celebrate my husbands birthday-nice touch. Any requests we had were met within minutes, I’ve stayed at many five star hotels in my time but the guest attentiveness and speed was second to none I have experienced! We used this hotel as our base to attend the Formula One weekend and was ideally located for us, 15 minute walk to our coach transfers and strolling distance of many cafes and bars at night. We utilised the pool and roof top terrace on our last day and what a fabulous place this was to relax. Room service was fast and tasty, personally I would have liked a little more choice. My husband raised a small concern with maintenance in the room next door to us starting while we were still in bed, this was more than resolved by the front of house team with our additional items charged to our room over the course of our stay removed free of charge to apologise - such a lovely gesture that was not expected! The morning we left we received a warm goodbye and also offered breakfasts to go free of charge because of the maintenance again. Thank you! If we return to Barcelona I wouldn’t hesitate booking here again. Well done to all your staff for the work they do, a great team! ","May 14, 2019","6    H10 Madison

Breakfast is very nice with lots of choice but poached eggs I ordered were overcooked and waffle overcooked too which is one of reasons I felt perhaps insufficient staff, overworked perhaps?

369,"I looked at hotels for quite some time before making my selection, and after staying at the H10 Madison, I know that I made the right decision. The location was perfect because it was only a few minutes walk to the Cathedral, Gothic Quarter, shopping, and La Rambla, plus it was close enough to the beach, La Sagrada Familia, and Parc Guell that the cost of a taxi was incredibly reasonable. The inside of the hotel was very clean, the view from the terrace was great, and the staff of the hotel were the best I have ever seen.Breakfast downstairs is a little pricy, but worth every penny because the food and juices are fresh and the employees work hard to ensure you are satisfied with your meal. Jesus made me a hot chocolate, which is not on the menu, and it was unlike anything I have ever had before. The waffles were by far the best waffles I have ever eaten, and I can tell you that I have eaten a lot of waffles.Also, the staff who cleaned the rooms were swift and efficient, and came multiple times throughout the day to make sure everything was perfect for us. They came once to clean, once to water the flowers, and once to turn on the lights by the bed in the evening so that it was not dark when we arrived back to the room. Somewhere along the way, they also left little chocolates by the pillows that were quite tasty.With all things considered, including price, location, service, hotel furnishings, and cleanliness, this may have been the best hotel we have ever stayed at. The pillows could have been a little better, but I do not hold that against them because I am a picky pillow person. If considering the H10 Madison, do not look any further, this is the one for you!","May 3, 2019","6    H10 Madison

372,"We booked a junior suite at the H10 Madison for a family of four. The room was made up of a king size bed and a sofa bed, a small desk and chair and a large sized bathroom. Having stayed in many hotels in Europe, this was a great size for a family. The kids had plenty of room to play when we were in our room and we didn't feel like it was cramped. The hotel was very clean and the staff were very pleasant. Our kids loved the marshmallow jars in reception, as did quite a few adult guests, which was a nice extra touch. The breakfast on offer was amazing! There was so much variety from the usual continental breakfast to cooked breakfasts based on your personal preferences. The restaurant itself was very nice too and the staff were very attentive. The hotel is in the perfect location, 5 - 10 minutes walk to La Rambla and Placa Catalunya, so you can have the hustle and bustle when you want it but then you can come back to the quieter area where the hotel is located. We had booked a bus tour with Bus Turistic and the bus stop was a few minutes walk from the hotel, so this was perfect as we never needed any taxis other than getting to and from the airport. There are lots of restaurants nearby so we walked to dinner every evening too. We visited the hotel rooftop bar on our last day and were very pleasantly surprised, the seating area and pool were very clean and the views were amazing. If the weather had been warmer we definitely would have got into the pool!I would highly recommend the H10 Madison to anyone visiting Barcelona. Having stayed at the Grand Marina Hotel (World Trade centre) last time we visited Barcelona, which is rated as being a 5 star hotel (and it was), I would be inclined to say that we found this hotel as being better due to the location and general feel of the hotel, it's much better value for your money too.

374,"A 4 day stay at this hotel recently was a very nice one. 40 euro taxi from airport with late checkin in, not a problem and desk attendant courteous. Room itself was quiet with double glaze window despite being next to street. No temperature issues. Complimentary water each day and state of room was excellent with now wear or tear. Enough space to lay cases and very happy, only gripe is very limited English TV but you aren't there to watch TV! There is an 8th floor pool and bar and this is great on a sunny day although not really on my trip due to temperature. I didnt check if pool was heated. The only other nuisance was breakfast not included, and at 23 euro its a bit. in saying this I had it each day and some of best cooked breakfast ive ever had! The staff were very good and remembered my preference on day 2 (perhaps I had odd breakfast!). There are two train stations in opposite directions, Jaume 1 (closer, about 5 mins walk) and Urqinaona with get you onto the easily useable train lines. The hotels closest landmark is the Cathedral right next to it. The tourist buses depart near this so you can hop on and hop off (advisable as some landmarks are a fair trek in busy Barcelona!). The bathroom and shower was well appointed and spacious and the Internet worked fine. Would happily stay here again","April 28, 2019","6    H10 Madison

375,"I stayed in the H10 Madison with my partner for a weekend break. The hotel is in a fantastic location near the Cathedral, walking distance to many sights such as the Picasso Museum, and a short walk from the Metro. We arrived in the evening, following a quick and easy taxi ride from the airport and were greeted by a friendly receptionist, who offered us a complimentary glass of Cava. As we had joined the H10 club we were also given vouchers for free cocktails. We were assigned a room on the top floor, at the front of the hotel. Unfortunately I am a very light sleeper and despite the excellent double glazing, had problems sleeping due to slight road noise (mainly from mopeds). When I asked if would move rooms the next morning, the staff were happy to oblige and asked us to pack our suitcases and leave them in the room and they would be moved to a new room while we were out for the day- very convenient.When we returned that evening our bags had indeed been moved to a different room, which looked out into a courtyard. While being slightly smaller than the previous room, it was amazingly quiet- no noise from either outside or other hotel rooms and I slept wonderfully. The staff at reception were kind enough even to check I had slept better the next morning after changing rooms. The hotel itself is stylish, light and airy throughout. It has a beautiful roof terrace with a plunge pool (we didn’t use the pool as it was a little chilly in February), and the reception area is well furnished with interesting artwork and comfortable sofas. As the hotel is an old and characterful building, all the rooms are different shapes and sizes. The rooms are beautifully decorated in light colours and wood, with good quality mattresses and bedding and enough storage space for clothes and suitcases. Our second room had a cute balcony which overlooked the courtyard. The bathrooms were luxurious, with robes and sippers provided and good quality Rituals toiletries and amenity kits. Nespresso machines are provided in all rooms- I would have preferred a kettle. The reception desk were unable to provide a kettle but the bar staff were happy to provide a pot of hot water and a tea cup. Breakfast is served in the restaurant and was fantastic. I enjoyed choosing a different freshly made hot dish every day from the menu (especially the delicious waffles), and the selection of cold food was superb. The breakfast room was never busy and staff were friendly and efficient. We used our free drinks vouchers on the last night and I enjoyed a well made mojito. This was our first time staying in a H10 hotel and I would definitely return. All the hotel staff were genuinely kind and friendly, and the hotel was well run and provided a lovely relaxing base for our city break.","April 26, 2019","6    H10 Madison

379,"We loved Hotel Rec. The pool (it's small but we loved it) provided the perfect environment to rest and recoup after several HOT days walking around Barcelona and taking in the sites. The location was perfect for us - just a few steps from Arc de Triomf, where we caught the train for a day-long tour in Penedes one day. It's also walking/running distance to the beach and lots of other sites. We thoroughly enjoyed the cocktail classes at the end of the day - it gave us a chance to chat with other guests and the staff, exchange restaurant recommendations, and get a few free drinks on the house. :) The breakfast was amazing - so many options and beautifully presented. We also enjoyed an evening of live Catalan music during our stay. For the price, I thought Hotel Rec was an incredible deal. So glad we went with this hotel instead of the many others we looked at.","July 11, 2019","7    Hotel Rec Barcelona

The breakfast in the 7th floor was really good and you can choose to eat outside by the pool if you like. The breakfast had everything we wanted and the atmosphere was chilled and relaxed. No stress. We only stayed for 2 nights so this was a great place to be for that amount of time. For longer visits I would recommend a larger room with a fridge etc. (Dont know if this hotel has that kind of room). The location of the hotel is great. Close to «everything», but still pretty quiet. We did not hear any noices from the streets or other rooms. The AC was working great as well. After our checkout we had to kill some hours before taking the train to our next destination. The hotel has a great system to store luggage for these situations.Kind regards,Morten","July 7, 2019","7    Hotel Rec Barcelona

385,"A friend and I took a week and a half vacation to Europe, splitting the time between Paris and Barcelona, with Barcelona being the 2nd half of the trip. The hotel we stayed at in Paris was equally nice but more formal and a tiny room. Hotel Rec’s rooms are still small by American standards, but the design is very open and well done. We never felt confined. There is a small area to hang clothes, but, yes, as other reviews mentioned, no place to really put clothes otherwise. But with 2 ladies sharing the same space, we had no problems. There were 2 luggage holders that we were able to set our suitcases on and easily work out of. There is also a desk that could be used for clothes if desired. The bed was really comfortable, nice and big, and the shower was great. There are coffee and tea capabilities in the room, but you can also get a decent cup of coffee from the vending machine for 1-1/2 Euros. Our room was located on the 5th floor street-side, and we loved it. We could open the window and get fresh air and see and hear the local street noises, which we enjoyed, or close it and not hear a peep.Upon arriving the first day, as most reviewers stated, we were greeted by 2 very friendly team members and offered our choice of a beverage. The very nice female got us all checked in and gave us a map and went over the highlights with us. We went up to the rooftop area for a snack and a drink. Yum! The nachos and fresh guacamole and the hummus were delicious! The views are nice—all windows— and the furniture comfy. The servers were friendly. The pool is tiny but nice for lounging. The location of Hotel Rec is great. Right in the Gothic Quarter with easy access to the places to eat, transportation, the Picasso museum, the beach, shopping, flamenco dancing, a local market where you can pick up and small personal or food items that you might need, etc. There is a city tour bus that had a stop super close. And if you do need a taxi, yes you have to walk a few feet to the main road to access it, but it’s super close as well. We went to Harlem Jazz Club, which was about mile and half away and walked home from there at 3 a.m. and felt safe. We had debated between Hotel Jazz and Hotel Rec, and ultimately went with Rec because it was less costly. We found out they are owned by the same company and have similar standards. Rec takes pride in being the “friendly hotel.” Which they definitely are. The one front desk team member that really stood out throughout our stay was Joel. He was kind, sincere, helpful and made you feel as if he personally cared that you were taken care of. And all of the team speaks English, if that’s something you need. I would definitely stay here again! Don’t hesitate if you are considering it. :)","July 6, 2019","7    Hotel Rec Barcelona

Also they provided us with information about the neighborhood and activities that day. Helpful, intuitive and friendly are the words that pop up when I think of the first contact with the staff. Throughout our stay this was the constant attitude of all staff. The room was of a good size, but with little cupboard space. Coffee and tea making facilities, rain shower, build in blue tooth speakers, perfect free Wifi, very big and comfortable bed and blackout curtains. All in a contemporary design. The hotel is situated in the gothic neighborhood and from the hotel you can easily walk anywhere. The breakfast buffet is of good quality and very sufficient. Upon checkout they stored our luggage in a locker of which we got the key card, so very safe.

Paola greeted us warmly (in English, our first language), showed us to the gummy-bears while she completed our paperwork, and made sure we were rehydrated with cold water and beer after the walk. Our room featured very clever use of space, including a sliding mirror that doubled as a shower-wall so the sleeping guest could rest without glaring bathroom light. The rooftop poolside breakfast offered all the hot and cold food we could want and prepared us for a day of walking around this delightful ancient and modern city. A red-line metro stop at Trionfo was just a few minutes' walk away, for both in-town metro services and connections to the train to France.REC staff even helped us reserve a last-minute table at the adjacent Fismuler restaurant, which provided a free bottle of wine to REC clients.

Room rates are on the high side, but good value for the money, especially since it is Adults Only. Booking online with the hotel was easy. The location is close to the Metro, the Arc de Triomf, the Aquarium and many interesting stores and restaurants in the Old Quarter. We walked to Las Ramblas, although it was a bit of a hike. The rooftop terrace was an unexpected bonus - we sat in the sun with our devices and marvelled at the deep blue skies and gorgeous skyline. There was a free activity (tastings, food samples, etc.) almost every day. The rooms are compact but very comfortable. There was no fridge available in the room (no space). Be aware that there is limited vehicle access - the taxi will drop you off on the main street nearby and you have to walk a few hundred meters across a paved plaza to the hotel. There are lots of supermercados and restaurants nearby - you can buy baked goods, yogurt and fruit. Some eateries do not open until late but there are others who cater to tourist tastes for early dining. The neighbourhood is fascinating and the streets are very clean.

Bathroom kind of merges with the bedroom, which is ok, but really intrudes into the room space. Only fault was there was no place to put your suitcases. Not great when there's usually 2 persons in a room with at least 1 case and one piece of hand luggage each. Maybe we were meant to share the giant bed with the suitcases?? Rooms had opening windows, which was lovely to make a change from air con. Breakfast served on top floor was good, with a number of different choices, including gf options. Would be better if staff used gloves to handle food though. Pool was very small, wouldn't fit many people! Service was warm and friendly. Metro station was around the corner, lots of bike hire places close. Within walking distance from La Rambla through the lanes of the Gotic area with plenty of eating and drinking options along the way.

Wifi had good bandwidth too. I will only recommend they have a mini-refrigerator as well.Breakfast at their comfortable 7th floor lounge( with expansive views of the neighbourhood Gothic quarter) had extensive choices of juices, beverages, yoghurt, fresh fruits, sausages, cheese, ham, condiments, and hot items like scrambled eggs, bacon, fried rice...

414,"Brief overnight in Barcelona returning from a trip to India. This is a really nicely done boutique hotel which combines innovative design with comfort. It's also very well located in Barcelona in a neighborhood with a lot of charm and character. The basic room is on the smallish side, but it's so well designed it doesn't feel cramped or claustrophobic. The beds are huge and extremely comfortable. The top floor lounge for breakfast and relaxing is beautiful, all glass with lovely views, with a nice outdoor pool up there as well. Slept well and would repeat and recommend.","May 21, 2019","7    Hotel Rec Barcelona

419,"This hotel has style, but when it comes to hospitality it is definitely lacking. My new husband and I came here for our last stop on our honeymoon and they gave us a room with 2 twin beds, saying that they couldn’t do anything else for us. The beds were put together, so it ended up working out...but it wasn’t ideal. Also, the pool is a miniature pool, only good enough for a toddler - even though it’s an adults only hotel. The depth is literally 70cm => 27 inches. The lounge around the pool actually serves pretty good food. The cheeseburger was so good that we attempted to order a second, but there was a master mixology class - in which the bartender and cook were teaching...so no one could cook the food. The next evening we tried to order a cheeseburger again, and they weren’t serving it. The bartender didn’t even seem to care at all that we were bothered by that...but that carelessness seems to be the norm in Barcelona from what I’ve gathered. All in all, it’s a pretty basic hotel in a pretty good location. ","May 15, 2019","7    Hotel Rec Barcelona

From the moment we arrived we were made very welcome, we were offered a complimentary glass of wine, bubbles or beer on arrival, the reception team were great through out our stay, all questions answered and helped with nearby restaurant tips like Ginettes which was very nice and only 3 minute walk from hotel. Fismuler right next door to the hotel was also very nice both need to be booked if you’re in a group as very busy. The bar staff, Serene and Monica were super. The Hotel Rec has a free drink tasting master classes early evening each night is a fun touch, although we didn’t attend we did see a few of them. Breakfast was included and had a reasonable choice.

Take the option with the breakfast included, it's well worth it to start each morning off with the large arrangement they have and some great views. We found the location great since we didn't want to be by La Rambla. There were several really good restaurants and many walkable sites.

426,"Hotel REC is well located - Placa Catalunya is a 15 min walk from here. The Hotel’s decor shows great taste which is reflected in the Reception, corridors and breakfast areas. The staff were efficient and friendly.The room we stayed in cost us a bomb (Euros 181) for a single night’s stay and was ridiculously small. The room was definitely well organised, as it had to be, given its size. The result was a room that was completely cramped for space. The toilet and bath were separate, which was the saving grace of the room. We don’t understand if the high rate we paid was due to peak traffic - we were at Barcelona at the time of the Championship League football match. However in the past, we have stayed in different hotels in the city during such peak weeks and this has to be the smallest room we have ever stayed in. Breakfast was served at the attic which was large, very well ventilated and offered good views of the city and outdoor seating. The breakfast was a large spread with fresh and preserved fruits, muesli, fresh juices, breads, croissants, cheeses, eggs and a very large spread of desserts!

The rooftop restaurant with a 360 views of BCN and a pool is fab. Breakfast was delicious and with plenty of healthy options (loved the chia and coconut and fresh orange juice). Definitely have to go back to use the pool).Location is also a great plus. Right next to the Arc de Triomf you are within easy walk to the hip Born Area through the park as well as Gothic Quarter, Las Ramblas, Barceloneta etc. Wholeheartedly recommend the Hotel Rec and hope to return soon.","April 28, 2019","7    Hotel Rec Barcelona

The place is very tastefully decorated and clean.The location is awesome. You can walk to La Sagrada Familia and along that strip you can board the tour bus and take in the sights plus shop. There are many nearby restaurants, markets, hair salons and it’s a nice area to just stroll.There is a great little coffee place a cross the street that has great sandwiches and pastries if you are looking for something quick and light.Jon and Kiku are gracious hosts and just great people.

The BB is in a great neighborhood and is within walking distance to the Paseo de Gracia, Las Ramblas, La Sagrada Familia. There are plenty of excellent places to eat nearby. We loved the seafood restaurant La Barca del Pescador that is in front of the BB. The freshest seafood great bartenders and is always frequented by ""Catalanes"". The BB is located in a beautiful building and it elegantly decorated with beautiful pieces and paintings collected by the owners from different parts of the world. Jon Jairo and Kiku are wonderful and will readily answer your questions and suggest great places to eat. The rooms have very comfortable beds and pillow and a Nespresso cofee maker.

463,"Just returned from an 8 night stay at BarcelonaBB…our “home away from home” in Barcelona. We feel so fortunate that we discovered this gem 3 years ago and that we are able to return once or twice a year. It has all the elements that keep us coming back – charming owners/Jon & Kiku, ideal location in the L’Eixample neighborhood with many restaurants, shops, markets, historic sites in walking distance, a variety of rooms & suites at a fair price, beautiful décor with a combination of antiques & modern elements, breakfast each morning at a communal table with a chance to meet and chat with other guests, and truly the loveliest staff/Nieves & Ayesha who make you feel so welcome. And, of course, it’s in beautiful, exciting Barcelona, with such a variety of sites, activities and day trip possibilities. Each visit, we also discover more things to do “off the beaten path.” The amazing City Hall/Casa de la Ciutat in Placa Sant Jaume (open Sunday mornings only.) The Reial Academia Catalana de Belles Arts de Sant Jordi (limited hours Monday – Friday) – a chance to walk in Picasso’s footsteps at his former art school, now a small museum filled with paintings and sculptures by Spanish artists. MUHBA Refugi 307 – a Spanish Civil War bunker in Poble Sec (Sunday morning tours.) And we also spent one leisurely afternoon strolling down the Rambla de Poble Nou – a lovely pedestrianized street in a neighborhood close to Port Olympic.

465,We spent 6 days and five nights here at BarcelonaBB and it was truly a home away from home. We booked the wooden room which was quite large with a king size bed. As this was the second part of our trip--it was a welcome change from the tiny beds in London. The owner is very nice and took time to answer any of our questions that we had when we arrived. She didn't stay at the location as she hosts multiple properties but she was an email away. The breakfast in the morning is nice where you can get a continental breakfast with the option of having eggs cooked to order.The location is really amazing for the price that you pay. You are a block away from the metro and approximately 10 minutes from Sagrada Familia. The only minor issue we had was the language barrier at times since not everyone spoke fluent English. This wasn't that big of a deal as we were able to get by. Considering the high prices for hotels especially in August this was truly great value. We would definitely stay here again. ,"September 4, 2017","8    BarcelonaBB

The first thing you notice as you walk into the front doors and into the apartment is the heavy decor which personally I love! The home has so much character. Probably good to take note that It isn't a hotel so expect to hear everyone walking around outside your door/next door and using the bathroom. Telma was such a wonderful lady and was so very helpful with suggestions, recommendations and making you feel at home! She had given us the second bathroom for private use so that we didn't have to share which was actually really nice for privacy. Nevis (not sure if I spelt her name right) was the most beautiful lady and she every morning prepared delicious breakfasts , she even packed us a to go breakfast as we had to leave at some stupid hour of the morning to catch the first flight.

The White Room was our favorite as it was spacious, including a separate room with a desk, sofa and fridge. The bathroom was also part of the suite. The Wooden Room was attractive, but seemed cramped after the White, and the bathroom was across the hall.

470,"On October 16, 2016 we booked and prepaid for a five night stay starting October 16, 2017. While it is just happenstance that this was exactly one year in advance, it is not unusual for us to book our accommodations well in advance. This was part of a five week trip with a week in Madrid immediately before the stay in Barcelona and a cruise to the U.S. immediately following the stay. Therefore, we did not have flexibility and wanted our accommodations set well in advance. This stay included part of a weekend, the Friday night but not Saturday as we would be boarding the ship on Saturday morning. On May 29, 2017 we received an e-mail from Jon and Kiku announcing that they were getting married around the time of our stay; they needed all of the rooms in the B&B for family and friends and that they were therefore cancelling our reservation and would refund the first night’s payment. I responded, congratulating them on their upcoming nuptials, but reminding them that we had prepaid for the whole stay. They responded acknowledging that we had prepaid for the entire stay and recommending a B&B in the same neighborhood. Barcelona B&B is the sixth highest ranking B&B in Barcelona, and they B&B that they recommended was 28th ranked. They have since refunded our money in full and we have found accommodations at a comparably ranked B&B at an additional cost to us of over $300. Running a B&B is a business. As a customer we feel that we have the right to expect the B&B to honor our reservations, especially prepaid reservations that did not give us the right to back out. While we continue to wish Jon and Kiku a long and happy married life, we think that their wedding arrangements should have respected their business commitments. We do not feel that we have been properly dealt with and our reasonable expectations respected. We have stayed at highly rated B&B’s around the world. We do not stay at Airbnb’s where someone is just renting a room in their apartment. If someone treats their B&B business like a side rental in an apartment then perhaps they should not be in the business.","June 4, 2017","8    BarcelonaBB

We are impressed with all the renovations Jon & Kiku have done over the Winter…a bathroom addition, reconfiguring a few main floor rooms so most will have a private bath. But happy to report the things we love most about this place have not changed. Jon & Kiku, ever the engaging and genial hosts. Lovely staff members – Nieves & Ayesha - who ask you each morning – un café? un omelet? Camaraderie shared with other B&B guests at the breakfast table. Beautifully decorated rooms & common areas. And the sense that each guest should feel that this is their home for the next few days while exploring exciting Barcelona. Within walking distance, wonderful restaurants…try The Sopa Boba - it’s nearby and a new one for us, the terrific Concepcio Market only a block away where you can buy every kind of food imaginable, La Vinicola Wine Shop just down the street, Gaudi’s La Sagrada Familia, Casa Mila, Casa Battlo and other Modernista houses only a 10 minute walk, 2 metro stops, the quaint village of Gracia a few steps away, and the AltaFit Gym across the street should you feel the urge to work out…what more could you ask for?

It's really authentic and Jose is a really great and friendly guy who will come over every day and ask you if you need something. I can only recommend it.But don't get it wrong it's not a party hostel it's very quiet and you should be prepared this neighborhood is some minutes by metro away from party.

If you are not looking for a party hostel but a place less crowded, this is the place for you. Don't worry about the distance to the city centre, if you are going somewhere in Barcelona, you need to take the Metro anyway. The house is located in the quiet and friendly San Andrea area, and only a 10 min walk from a direct Metro to the city centre, and the direct railway line to the Airport terminal 2. There is also a marked close by, that's open till 24. There is also restaurants and small shops close by. The hostel is clean and the host very friendly and helpful.

Placed in Sant Andreu, it was a friendly and on the first day, being pasty white in the scorching Barcelona sun, a concerned resident in the streets stopped us to make sure I was wearing high suncream. This summed up the community and it felt, to us, as though we were part of it.I would strongly recommend staying at Coroleu House if you're looking for a hostel with a personal touch!

505,"I stayed at the Coroleu House for four nights recently with my boyfriend. On a budget, he and I had agreed to stick to hostels mainly. However, as a light sleeper & a person who hates party hostels (as most are), I was hesitant. However, this hostel is located in a real house in a neighborhood where there are no tourists (yet a few minutes walk from the metro)! I feel like less than ten guests were there, and it was never loud or obnoxious. Jose Maria, the owner, is super sweet and attentive to your needs. He explained everything we needed to know. I also ended up getting sick while I was there and he wrote my boyfriend a note in Catalan to give to the pharmacist (who subsequently got me medicine). There was a big kitchen filled with everything you could need, and I used it to make dinner once. I read a review on here saying ""I wish they had more than 2 bathrooms"". They do- there are 2 showers and 3 toilets. The only complaint if anything I would have is that the upstairs rooms are extremely hot, around 75 degrees I would say, and my roommates and I did not even use a sheet. The air conditioning did not work up there. A simple fan would fix this issue. Everything else- perfect! Would definitely come back!","June 16, 2015","9    Coroleu House Barcelona

512,"This hostel has it all guys. First and foremost, its spacious and clean. Let me break it down for you: I was traveling in a group of 6 girls. We booked the private 6 person room and even with that many girls we felt that we had plenty of space. I might even argue that it was luxurious for a hostel in Europe.In addition, the hostel in a beautiful area that gives you the feeling of living in Barcelona while still keeping it convenient to all the touristy sights. There aren't tourists everywhere and the restaurants in the area are super chill and authentic. Real talk: it maybe took us between 5 and 10 minutes to get around and even when it was crowded in the metro, trains came every 3 minutes or so. The Barcelona metro system is inexpensive, safe, clean, and easy to figure out. By the time we left Barcelona (4 days), we were pro's at getting to and around the city center. Lastly, the hostel was clean, spacious, and had everything that you need if you want to do things like make breakfast or dinner while you're there. Really there is no where else that I would stay! I can guarantee that you will be more than happy with this choice!Now a final, final word on our gracious host. Everything that all the other reviews have said are true. Jose is warm, kind, and full of recommendations! Immediately when you get there Jose give you an in-depth break down of the sights and neighborhoods. More than that though, he tell you his favorite places to eat and the best ways to spend your days in Barcelona. Every one of his recommendations that we tried turned out to be amazing! Trust me, you should stay here because when you stay at Coroleu house you don't feel like you're at a hostel.

514,"This is one of the best places I've ever stayed. Located in a quiet suburb about 15 minutes on the train or underground from all the tourist sites in Barcelona, it was near enough to be convenient, but peaceful after a long day in the sunshine. The train line also runs directly to the main airport making it really convenient. There were a number of small supermarkets and bakeries within easy walking distance, and also a few nice restaurants and tapas places nearby.The owner is the perfect host; nothing was too much trouble, and he has lots of handy tips to help you make the most of the city. He forwarded some ideas of places to go via what's app, which meant I could access maps for them when I was out and about. The place was spotlessly clean, with comfortable beds, and a well equipped kitchen and lounge area. Security was good, with individual lockers in the dorm room, and code access to the front door which was changed daily. The bathrooms were modern and clean, and there was always hot water available from the powerful showers. There was a nice enclosed terrace area with seating out the back, and wi-fi throughout the building. Towels and sheets were also provided, along with use of a hairdryer and iron, which are nice extras when you've been away from home for a while.

537,"On a two and a half week trip with friends - all of us fresh out of high school - this was by far the best hostel we stayed at. If you're looking for a hostel that feels like home, there's no other way to go. The atmosphere at Coroleu House is, as the title suggests, incomparable. From the cleanliness of the hostel to the amazingly hospitable owner, Jose Maria, no other place we stayed felt as nice. We would go on to rent out an apartment for ourselves in Paris, and I can still say with absolute confidence, that Coroleu House felt more like home. Everything is within reach of the metro which is a mere 3 minutes away. It's situated in a beautiful, quiet neighborhood, which was a relief in contrast to the city center which was always alive. And I can't possibly say enough about Jose Maria. From the moment we stepped into Coroleu House, he was ready to help us with our trip. From sightseeing recommendations to dinner reservations, he was never too busy to lend us a hand. We owe much of our beautiful stay in Barcelona to Jose Maria. For your money, nothing else compares.","July 22, 2014","9    Coroleu House Barcelona

538,"Not even a question. If you're looking for a hostel, there's nowhere else to consider.1. The place is the cleanest hostel we stayed in all trip, we had the 6 bed private room and it was incredibly tidy, as was the kitchen and living room.2. The location, while a little removed from the city, is only 10 minutes away via metro, which is very easy to use, and is a gorgeous neighborhood with shops galore during the day, and silent as a mouse at night. Provides a wonderful contrast coming home from the clubs when you get off the bus and the neighborhood is asleep. Also everything is cheaper in this neighborhood3. Most importantly, however, is the owner. Hospitality is something to be expected at a hotel, but Jose Maria (the owner) treats you like family. You want to eat paella? He makes a reservation for you. You need a tip on a place to get clothes? Send a text/whatsapp/whatever else you may have and he'll reply with a recommendation almost immediately. We have him to thank for recommending our best food and best sites. Jose Maria is the man.In conclusion, there is no reason not to stay here. Even with all of those benefits, the price was still remarkably low. Staying here was the best decision we made all trip.","July 20, 2014","9    Coroleu House Barcelona

Good option who wants to get some rest after a day full of walking without noise and stress! Even if you want to go out for ramblas, its close, is an excelent choice due the quality of facilities and the final price per day!The facilities are really good, always clean. The neighbourhood of Sant Andreu is really quite, welcoming and has good tapas aswell, but cheaper ! Everything was perfect, i was really impressed with the owner Jose Maria, he provides a lot of information and advices according with your days in the city, always online by whatsapp for any requests.

541,"I made a reservation with Guesthouse Gotic last week through Agoda, which is the same platform as Booking dot com. According to the booking a EUR payment was to be collected by the property as a non-refundable pre-payment. I paid online by credit card.During the night after I made my booking my credit card was charged in GBP for a different amount than the contractually agreed EUR amount. The property only has a minimalist webpage with only a phone number and no email address to contact. I tried to contact them via Agoda customer service, which is a hellish experience and called them to have the charge reversed, or a written confirmation that this is only supposed to be a pre-authorization, which will be reversed once I pay in EUR at the property.Via phone they lied to me and claimed that they had not charged my credit card, which was a blatant lie since I had my credit card statement in front of me.Via Agoda support they eventually acknowledged that they indeed charged my card with a fraudulent amount but both Agoda and the property exhibited an utter incompetence in getting the issue resolved.After several days back and forth via Agoda automated support system and several phone calls to the property, my booking was eventually cancelled without my consent and the fraudulent amount PARTIALLY refunded by the property. I made a loss since they probably refunded the fraudulent GBP amount and not the actual EUR amount.This cost me a substantial amount of time and nerves and is due to corrupt business practices and utter incompetence, STAY AWAY!","April 15, 2019","10    Guesthouse Barcelona Gotic

545,"My wife and I came for a short break in Barcelona at the end of July and were delighted with the Guesthouse. The room was comfortable, they moved us to a superior room (with private bathroom) for no extra charge and had good sized lockers for us to store our case in (as we arrived in the city early morning before we could check in). The service was excellent.The location is ideal. From the guesthouse the walking time to places such as La Rambla, Barceloneta, La Catedral and Ciutadella is very easy (anything from 5 minutes to 15 minutes). There are some wonderful bars and restaurants within a stones throw of the guesthouse (Bar Celta Pulperia and Colom Restaurant were two of our favourites - both less than 5 minutes walk from the guesthouse).The only slight difficulty we had was controlling the temperature in our room (we were in Barcelona during a reasonably hot weekend). There was a large fan provided, but the fan wasn't very effective. Nonetheless, the shower water temperature could be turned down cold if desired and the large balcony-style doors both proved helpful in mitigating this. No hesitation in recommending this place to all visitors in central Barcelona who want comfort but without paying inordinate amounts of money to central hotels.","August 16, 2018","10    Guesthouse Barcelona Gotic

563,"Stayed here for three nights. We chose it for the location and price. It was really hard to beat. I'll start with the positives. Clean room and our shared bathroom was V clean. Rooms got cleaned daily. Breakfast was pretty good for a continental in a hostel. Staff were pleasant. Location is superb. The Gothic quarter is somewhere that is perfect for tourists. As central as can be. Some nice bars and cafes nearby alongside cheap supermarkets. Ok now for the cons. Obviously when paying a low price there will be trade offs. Walls were thin. Thin enough that we could hear the people in the room next door whispering. Not an exaggeration. I'm a heavy sleeper though so it didn't bother me too much. Security was a major turn off. Had I realised before how security worked there I would not have went for it. So you get a key for your room. You have to give the key into reception when leaving the hostel and ask for it back when returning. Seems like a very insecure method as there was no verification required for collecting a key. We were also handed the key to the room beside us on one occasion. There were no safes in our room to add to this so we really did not feel like our things were secure in our room. If you want to use a locker it is €2. I probably wouldn't book again mainly due to my thoughts on their security. Also they have emailed me that they are having a competition for leaving review. The prize is a mini iPad. To quote the email ""But remember… participate will be possible as long as the person has stayed here and can appreciate her o his experience publicly.""

I walked past it about 4 times before stopping locals to ask for help. Press the bell and the door opens so then to make my way upstairs to the reception. I was greeted by a man and woman who were nice enough, he did say when you leave the hotel leave my key with him.8 am I woke up and left the hotel to meet someone, no one was at reception so I just nipped downstairs, it wasn't an issue because I was only a few minutes!Only to find, that upon my return with my friend and I was to be greeted by this vicious woman who was very upset I had left the hotel with the key, this is the key which was in my hand that I opened the door with, the last thing I thought about was keeping her happy and pressing the bell to give her the room key...She was not impressed! In fact her attitude was shocking! She was refusing my friend into my room. Whilst I packed my case because he wasn't a guest, she told him to sit in reception and be quiet!?!? She then continued to follow him telling him to be quiet, his repbecause your the one making me talk...To be honest I wouldn't stay at this hotel ever again and certainly would NOT recommend staying here... This woman who claims to be the manager is a horrible woman who is rude and quite honestly Nasty!Oh did I mention that someone has wiped the nose up the wall in a little shelf set into the wall and I had to sleep next to that...Pay a little more and stay some where which will show you a little more respect as a paying customer. The actual hotel was not bad, clean bathroom and communal areas, the room was alright for the price paid.Ypu do get what you pay for so I can't really moan about that.After I wrote the above the actual hotel manager has been emailing asking for details and in his and the hotels defence he seems to be talking time to look into this with some seriousness, so for those wishing to book then maybe give it a go and you will receive a better experience than myself.

There was a mini bar with a variety of drinks & snacks. I did not get my room serviced the 1st day & upon returning to my room late the front desk called to confirm that I did not need any additional amenities. The ice machine did not work on my floor but room service brought me ice with no extra charge. The front desk clerk was very attentive and remembered by name from me previously calling the hotel to confirm reservations & each time he seen me addressed me by my name. Upon check in the lobby was busy and he was the only person working. He handled the stress with professionalism and got everyone checked in expeditiously, including assisting a gentleman of Asian decent where there was an apparent language barrier that he handled with ease. There was two types of refreshing beverages in the lobby and sweet treats which was a plus. The only thing that would have made my stay even better was if there was a pool to use.

The hotel is surrounded by a wooden fence and a construction site, there is a painted wooden tunnel from reception to the lifts and all public areas are out of use, except for a small seating area. The room was comfortable but tired and the air con was not working - apparently not switched on until the outside temperature reaches 20C - but our room was too hot at 25 C for easy sleeping.

611,Good hotel in a very convenient location opposite Barcelona Sants station and close to the metro which will take you directly to the coastal area of Barcelona. Travel to and from the airport with ease or travel onwards to many locations by train. The hotel is good at the moment as it is being refurbished but is soon to be excellent judging by the amount of work being carried out. No disturbance from renovation works. Plenty of insulation against outside noise so makes for a good nights sleep. Stayed here many times over the years and would recommend it to anyone.,"April 16, 2019","11    Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya

626,"We stayed at 2 different hotels before and after the cruise. This is the one we stayed before the cruise for two nights. I wondered why there were mixed reviews when I was checking this hotel and now I know. First of all, when we got to the lobby, it is like 3 star as it's small, carpet is very dirty and outdated. We booked a comfort double room and was given a room on 6th floor. The room is outdated and the bathroom has mildew and rust. This room was not what was advertised on the website as the pictures and description have indicated a nice view. However, the room we were given was facing a parking lot. To make the matter worse, the bed is hard and the pillow is of the lowest grade. We were kept awake the whole night by a machine or something that is moving up and down the whole night. We finally figured out it is the elevator. Our room is down the hall by the renovated side and the wall insulation must have been removed. The next morning, I expressed my disappointment at the front desk. The lady was nice to hear my concern and said all their rooms were sold out. So I asked to talk to the manager. The front desk manager finally called me and said they will move me to the 18th floor. She was not very nice about it on the phone. The room on the 18th floor is much nicer like the pictures advertised on the expedia website. The bedding and pillows are of much better grade. If you go to the hotel website, they have different types of rooms but expedia only have one type of comfort double room. The higher floor rooms have been updated and do match the 4 star category. The lower floors room are like 3 star motel and not nice at all.","November 17, 2018","11    Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya

Breakfast is worth the money just for the views but the quality it is very good, with Good choice throughout; although the hot area wasn’t necessarily to the full tastes of a British palate, but still fine nonethelessThe front of house staff are excellent; friendly, attentive and very helpful.

But a hotel employee was there to take our luggage in so what the heck. The lobby showed no signs of the construction and the reception was super friendly. The hallway to the elevator had one plywood wall but once we reached our floor there were not signs of construction.The first view of the room is breathtaking.

638,"This hotel is a minute from Barcelona Sants station which provides access to trains, metro & bus services. The reception desk staff are friendly and always greet you with a smile and a welcome. In particular they provide the services of a staff member whose role is to provide information about tourist attractions, train services and answer questions which tourists might have. We would like to mention Jesus Lopez who was on duty when we arrived and was a wealth of information about the tourist attractions we should see. He also told us of the T-10 metro ticket which we could purchase for 10,20 euros. This ticket meant we were permitted 10 metro trips between both of us and it can be used until the 10 trips were all up. It saved us a good deal as buying a single ticket costs 2,20 euros. The rooms were extremely spacious and provided ample room for luggage storage. The cupboard space was extremely generous and it had an ironing board & iron stored there. There were 2 tables, several chairs, ample lighting in the room which included bedside lamps. There was a full length mirror in the room. Tea & coffee were provided in the room which was welcomed. On arrival there were 2 bottles of water as well as 4 delicious chocolate cakes and a lovely personlalised note to my wife which was to welcome both of us to the hotel. House keeping left lollies on the bedside table which was a lovely surprise on our return each day. It was cleaned daily The bathroom was larger than any we have ever seen with 2 sinks, a huge shower, a bath, toilet and bidet. Towels were huge and thick. Toiletries were so plentiful and of great quality; they consisted of shower gel, body lotion, shampoo & hair conditioner. New toothbrushes, tooth paste, sewing kit, cotton buds and shower cap were provided each day. The shower gel was fragrant and lathered up really well, unlike the products you tend to get in most hotels these days. It was more than we could use. Free wifi and TV were provided which included the usual English speaking channels such as the BBC. Lollies were provided along with iced cold water in the foyer each day for guests.

639,"Gran Hotel Torre CatalunyaBarcelonaGood Value/Excellent Hotel and Staff626233228This was a shot in the dark looking for a hotel in Barcelona on a weekend with a huge football match! The prices everywhere were ridiculous if you could find a hotel. I opted for this hotel because it was next to the Barcelona Sants train station where we were arriving from Malaga. (more later on the four stars)The highrise facade is unassuming but the inside is welcoming. The staff was extremely helpful and friendly! I booked a suite (1 Comfort Attic Plus) which included breakfast daily (more on that later). The room was fabulous with a separate seating area with a television. It was the best sleep I had during our entire vacation and this was the fourth and last hotel. The wall-to-wall windows gave us sweeping views being on a very high, or highest floor. Now let's talk price. Two nights for a suite for 389 Euro plus tax. That's exceptional. The included breakfast is AWESOME. There are so many options for both American and European travelers and the views are incredible. The service was exceptional as well. My favorite place was the hotel bar. It was guest-restricted by key card. It was never crowded, the service was great and food good as well. Why the four stars? It's relatively far from the main attractions (walking). We took a taxi everywhere. At one point, we tried to figure out the metro system because it was raining after a visit to La Sagrada Familia. No luck. Too confusing. And we're pretty much veterans of subway systems. I should have done my homework. Otherwise, I was so happy with this hotel. It was an excellent value for the price and I would definitely go there again even with its location.","October 19, 2018","11    Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya

The hotel had a wonderful breakfast upstairs on the 23rd floor that was included with our room. The view while having breakfast was beyond amazing. The staff was so friendly and helpful every time you stopped at the desk. The rooms were large and clean. The only issue we had the whole trip was the second day the air conditioning stopped working and a red light came on. I reported it and asked to have someone come look at it. While I was out someone called but did not come see for themselves and said that is just how the air conditioning worked and we could come get a fan. However the day before it was freezing in the room and we had to turn it down, also the red light was on which it wasnt before. We just opened the window and let the fresh air in as it was very not in the room. It can be a bit noisy on the street at night but we are New Yorkers and use to that so it was not bothersome.

It is situated close to everything....restaurants, pastry shops. hop on/hop off bus kiosk, train station and shopping. Kudos goes out to Jesus Lopez who recommended an outstanding restaurant about two or three blocks from the hotel called ""Zarautz"". One note: If you request them to print out your boarding pass, make sure it is the boarding pass and not just the confirmation of your check-in. This will save you a lot of hassles and confusion when you arrive at the airport..","October 8, 2018","11    Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya

649,"The hotel ambiance was nice, clean, and bright. The receptionist staff made it easy and efficient to check-in. The rooms were spacious, modern, and definitely clean. The bathroom was also spacious and had dual sinks (which I love)! I liked that the bathroom also offered extra toiletries in case you forgot something (ex: toothbrush/toothpaste (gel form), Q-tips, sewing kit). The bed and pillows were comfy and provided a great night sleep after a long day of walking and sight-seeing. The hotel is in a great location! It was easy and convenient to get around Barcelona because we were next to the main train station (Barcelona Sants). My boyfriend and I took the train to get to places we needed to go. We stayed in Barcelona for a few days and decided to buy the T-10 ticket which allows you to use the ticket 10 times. We bought 1 ticket to use between the two of us and each time we finished one, we would buy another one (cost was about 10 euros). You can have one person insert the ticket to get through first, then you pass the ticket to the second person to insert right after. You save a lot of money by purchasing the T-10 ticket so you don't have to purchase individual ones. Also, if you plan to do the Hop-on Hop-off Bus, the stop is walking distance from the hotel. You can also opt to take the street buses which has one right outside of the hotel. Thank you to the staff at Gran Torre Catalunya! We had a lovely stay and would definitely recommend this hotel to our friends and family.","October 2, 2018","11    Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya

654,"Hotel is right opposite Sants station which is Barca’s main central station . Easy links to and from the airport and trains/metro to literally everywhere in the city.Recommend you buy a travel card ticket for your duration of stay as it’s much cheaper and faster/convenient to travel rather than using taxis. The station is literally opposite so do not waste money on taxis and use the public transport. If you are stuck with how to use their transport system , as their stations especially Sants can be a bit confusing for tourists , then download and use CityMapper app as it works a treat in Barcelona (and most big cities).We booked the suite and it was huge, stunning and with amazing views of Barcelona.Breakfast was not included and quite pricy but well worth it - they have 360 degree panoramic views of the city and it really was 5* breakfast so I highly recommend getting this as it’s worth the price.The spa was amazing and the highlight of the hotel - I believe this is complimentary to guests staying in the suites but may be extra to use for other guests. We used the facilities including a hydro pool, which has various different jets to massage particular areas, sauna, steam room, and a massage shower pretty much every day. Our flight back home wasn’t until the evening so the morning we checked out they kindly allowed us to store our luggage in their lockers and use the spa facilities in the evening to freshen up before our flight back home to London.The rest of the hotel itself such as the lifts was a bit outdated, but still in very good condition and there was nothing wrong with it at all. I would definitely stay here again especially due to the spa, spectacular views and close proximity to Sants station. Sants is also one of the stops which is on the Hop on Hop off tour which is a must - it stops at all the must sees and is well worth it for the entire day out.","September 24, 2018","11    Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya

657,"The Gran Torre Cataluna is in such a convenient place – 2 minutes walk from the main railway station if travelling by train and from where there is convenient and regular train access to the airport. The rooms are of ample size and the bathrooms are exceptionally good: full-length bath with shower overhead; separate shower room; separate toilet. The views from the 23rd floor restaurant / breakfast room are truly spectacular as was the breakfast selection. My only negative comment is that the very charming breakfast staff should not also be expected to serve coffee & tea – just does not work and results in the customer being restricted in caffeine intake in the early morning, which may to some seem like the healthy option, but alas not to myself and probably many others. Educational comment – some hotel key cards can apparently be demagnetised if kept in the same pocket as your mobile – I was locked out after breakfast.","September 19, 2018","11    Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya

The breakfast quality was also good while enjoying a panoramic view of Barcelona.The train station next to the hotel makes it accessible to anywhere you want.Just if the hotel could make some renovations on the facade of the building it could be without doubt one the best 4-star hotels in Barcelona.

665,"This hotel is in a great location right across the street from the metro and RENFE SANS train station. We arrived from Madrid and were literally next to the hotel. The front desk gave us a very warm welcoming and accommodated us on a high floor to enjoy the beautiful city of Barcelona. We walked that night to the magical water fountain, which was an astonishing spectacle. The metro blue line right across the hotel will take you to La Sagrada Familia. This hotel is currently four stars and it’s being remodeled to become a five star hotel. I honestly thought it was already five stars. High ceilings, spacious room, extensive variety of cable tv channels, marble floors throughout the room and a separate shower and tub makes this place a truly remarkable hotel. I went during high season and found it to be reasonably priced for it’s high quality and location. I totally recommend this hotel. There is a pay laundromat like two blocks away. The locals are super friendly too. Oh BTW the room was always super clean.

666,"I stayed at Gran Torre Catalunya Hotel (GTC) for one night on the 13 April 2018. The decision to book the hotel was made due to two previous stays there: the first time in June 2010 for one night, the second time for in May 2011 for 5 nights (see my TripAdvisor review dated 21 September 2011).The purpose of this trip was to see Roger Waters at the Palau Sant Jordi Arena. My first stay at the GTC in 2010 was to the see Aerosmith at the same venue.I was as delighted with my experience stay in the hotel in 2018, as I was in 2011 and 2010.The RoomI booked a Comfort Double Room through Agoda.com. In 2011, I opted for a Suite (with an adjoining lounge), which I would encourage you to do if you are staying for multiple nights and have the budget to match. For one night the Comfort Double sufficed. The primary difference was the size of the room, but the quality of the room and the (marble) bathroom were exactly the same. As before, the housekeeping staff maintained the room to an exemplary standard when it came to cleanliness.The Common AreasBeing a somewhat aged 4 Star hotel, the GTC does suffer from the passage of time, with the interior’s aesthetic appearance resting comfortably in “dated” territory. However, this is adequately compensated for by staff ensuring all the common areas are kept to a 5 Star standard of cleanliness.The official hotel website confirms that during 2018, the hotel will be in the process of moving towards its complete transformation into the new, unique Nobu Hotel Barcelona. So, the GTC’s owners, the Selenta Group have thankfully seen the need for an extensive refurbishment, which can only bode well for 2019 onwards.The StaffTo find the staff displaying the same warm cordiality, with their firm commitment to enthusiastic and knowledgeable customer service on stay number three was both refreshing and laudable. It is no mean feat to achieve that level of optimal service quality over an eight-year period.The RestaurantThe Restaurante Visual and Bar Lounge on the 23rd floor of the GTC are undoubtably the jewel in its crown. The Visual is apparently the highest 360° roof lounge restaurant in Barcelona. On a clear day, the panoramic views of Barcelona are breath-taking and add a uniquely special ambience to the breakfast or evening dining experience.Due to flight time constraints, I was not able to take dinner on this trip, but the Concierge came up trumps with recommendation of the La Tagliatella Italian pizzeria restaurant at Arenas de Barcelona shopping complex a few blocks walk away, on the Gran Via de les Corts Catalanes. I will write a separate TripAdvisor review for this.The Restaurante Visual buffet breakfast continued to be a veritable treasure trove of choice and exceptionally good value. The cold and hot menu is equally suitable for vegetarians (I am) and meat-eaters alike. Upon finishing breakfast, I have always left Visual sated and ready to embark on the day’s adventures, so much so that I usually skip lunch and use the gained time to enjoy the city even more. The LocationUpon disembarking from your flight at El Prat International Airport, you have a mere 30-minute train to Sants Train Station. And if that was not enough of a bonus, the icing on the cake is the two-minute walk across the Plaça dels Països Catalans to the GTC.If you want to chill out in a park during after breakfast or lunch, there are two lovely parks in the neighbourhood: the Parc de l'Espanya Industrial at the side of the hotel and the Parc de Joan Miró a 5 to 10-minute walk away.If a music concert or sporting event at the Palau Sant Jordi Arena or the Estadi Olímpic Lluís Companys (where the 1992 Olympics were held) are on your schedule then, the GTC is a perfect place to stay. The hotel is walking distance of the Pl. Espanya, at the foot of Parc de Montjuïc, where these venues are situated.The Parc de Montjuïc has myriad other sights for visitors to relish: Fundació Joan Miró (Modern Art Museum), the Torre de Comunicacions de Montjuïc, the Museu d'Arqueologia de Catalunya, Jardí Botànic Històric, Park Jardins de Joan Brossa, Jardines de Laribal, Castell de Montjuïc (a 17th-century fortress and military museum). On the other side of the hill you can find, the Jardins de Mossèn Jacinto Verdaguer, the Park Jardins de Joan Brossa and the Jardins Mossèn Costa i Llobera (Botanical Gardens). There is a cable car that you can take from Montjuïc to the Puerto de Barcelona (Port), where there is a fantastic Aquarium.Thus, you can easily spend two days in the GTC part of the city and not get bored.","August 26, 2018","11    Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya

Staff is professional and attentive. Rooms are large, clean and well appointed.

668,"The rooms were quite large, considering the price, and as we were on the 14th floor, we had a good view. We didn't try the restaurant, but the restaurant on the top floor appears to have nice views. The rooms were adequately equipped but given that the hotel rates itself as a four-star hotel, lack of amenities such as a coffee machine and room slippers was a bit disappointing. Same with the hotel lobby--clean and adequate, but not exactly four-star. The location of the hotel is fine--not within walking distance of tourist attractions, but all within a short taxi ride (less than 10 Euros), so no problem. It's a good value for the price and I would not hesitate to return here but to me, the hotel should be rated three-stars rather than four. But that's not a big deal. One issue we had was that there appears to be an amusement park or a roller-coaster ride close to this hotel. On Saturday night, the roller coaster was still operating when I went to bed after 1AM, and the sound of the roller coaster and the people screaming was annoying. This did not appear to be a problem on nights other than Saturday, so not sure what the deal was.","August 22, 2018","11    Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya

We were on floor 11! Bathrooms are a great size and room was kept very clean. Restaurant on top floor is very large, we didn’t eat here as the choice of menu wasn’t to our taste and was quite pricy. The reviews are right in saying that this hotel is very close to Sants station. I didn’t find the metro system so easy to work, got on the wrong metro 3 times in the one week. Also, this hotel is a 40 minute walk to La Rambla, so if you’re hoping to enjoy a nice meal down that way it is a long walk back! Unfortunately the full week we were in Barcelona the taxi’s were on strike which was an inconvenience when staying in this hotel, as at night time I didn’t feel comfortable taking the metro at all, therefore it was difficult to go down La Rambla for a meal and drinks as you were limited as to how you got back to the hotel. Bar’s near this hotel also close at midnight and restaurants near this hotel are limited(or maybe we just couldn’t find any). This hotel was beautiful, but not as close to the centre as I would have liked, which is not the hotel’s fault what so ever I just thought I would make people aware! I would recommend this hotel for people on business trips or looking for a quiet holiday.

It was our 32 wedding anniversary celebration and on arrival we were upgrade to the 18 floor and a welcome drink waiting for us in the room,a beautiful gesture from the hotel staff. Very comfortable rooms with a gorgeous bathroom suite. We were surprised by the fact that there was not pool, but soon realized that might have been due to renovations going on.

675,Not the fault of the hotel but they’re undergoing major renovations and this impacts the enjoyment of the hotel no matter how hard the staff try to please - and they’re super helpful as a rule. No pool. No reception area etc etc. price is pretty similar to what I paid when it was all in top condition so I was left a little underwhelmed. On the upside I had a great room - very large with a great bathroom suite. Wifi is super fast. Breakfast is great and service excellent across the board. Bit of an ugly duckling building but if you like business class reliable hassle free hotels like me then still worth considering notwithstanding the reno. But make sure you get a room high up in the building. ,"July 31, 2018","11    Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya

676,"We stayed 9 nights at the Gran Torre. We had a bit of a rough first night, the mattress we slept in was defective. We brought this up to the staff the next morning and they immediately responded, moving us to an even bigger, better room (when all we wanted was a new mattress!)The staff was always helpful with any and all of our queries, I want to give a big shout out to Jesus and Agnes at the front desk -- top performers these two. Excellent people. As for the other stuff, hotel is perfectly situated. Close to the Sants train and metro stations. Good enough distance to walk to the city centre. Some nice places to eat nearby too. Again, very much recommend this hotel!- Marco","July 25, 2018","11    Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya

677,"This hotel has it all, located next to a main train station for easy access to the airport and Metro lines. A short walk to the magic fountain and great restaurants/ bars nearby. We had a room on the 17th floor and the view we had everyday was just such a treat. We didn't have breakfast or dinner at the hotel but the view is even better from the floor of the restaurant.The Expo hotel next door has an outdoor roof bar which we visited daily.We ate at the Arena shopping centre a 15 min walk away a couple of times, the restaurants are located on the top of the centre which give you great views and we recommend Quinto Quinta.The bedrooms are huge and very comfortable, only downside is lack of available tv channels apart from BBC World news and no coffee/tea facilities in the room but that I could live without when you have the whole of Barcelona to explore. The aircon was excellent which was much needed after walking around in 30c and above temperatures.Finally, the staff were brilliant, always friendly, helpful and cheery.We stayed there whilst there were renovations going on to the spa area but this didn't create any issues with noise or inconvenience. We will definitely be staying again.","July 23, 2018","11    Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya

My second time in Barcelona for my birthday March 2018 It's been must the last 2 years for me.This time I wanted to stay near the city centre and everything walking I needed within walking distance. I was excited when I booked my stay here and even more excited when I seen it in person! Unbelievable gorgeous views. I had the superior double room (suite). Rooms comes with Robes and slippers.The room was perfect. I was able to capture the sunsets and sunrises. The service was superb and all the guest service attendants were absolutely the best and so very helpful. They made my birthday very special. I can't thank everyone enough. I received a cupcake and champagne! I was all smiles the entire stay. Front desk offered suggestions where to go for anything I wanted to do or go. I walked everywhere as most restaurants were in walking distance, stores, sites I wanted to see. I started off early in the morning with great breakfast from the top floor with a panoramic view that is to die for to get me going. Alot of selections to choose to your liking. I loved that Fresh juice was served. The servers were awesome there as well. I did not get the chance to use most of the amenities like the spa, pool, and bar..because I was mostly out adventuring outside. This hotel would definitely likely be my 1st choice when I visit Barcelona. I just hope the pricing stays moderate as I know the more popular the hotel will become.","July 16, 2018","11    Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya

682,"I recently booked this hotel for a weekend away for my partners birthday.Having read the reviews and seen the photos I had high expectations of this hotel.Upon arriving check in was quick and seamless. Receptionist were warm and welcoming.We then headed to our room. The room at 1st appearances seemed just as lovely as the photos..spacious and bright.I however then went to the bathroom where my review turns sour.I noted that there were a number of ""pubic hairs"" on the toilet and bath!!I called reception straight away and someone was sent up and confirmed my findings.We were then taken to a further THREE!!! rooms were again hairs were found around the toilet. These were obviously not cleaned with a meticulous eye!Never have I stayed in a hotel where i have had to ask to be moved due to cleanliness and this being a 4* hotel i expected more.After being in the hotel for an hour we were finally moved to an upgraded room which they cleaned before sending us up.Inma Rodriguez was very helpful during this time however it should have never happened!After an annoying start to our weekend the room was lovely and the hotel was in a great location!Also to note that the gym and spa was closed due to renovations which meant my partner had to seek alternative places to work out at extra cost to us. Although it does state it is closed on the website reception staff say it closed 1 month ago..not helpful as we had booked just over 1 month ago.Would recommend on location but personally wouldn't stay here again in fear of the cleanliness of the hotel.","July 11, 2018","11    Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya

690,"This hotel had a very thorough check-in process. Just after booking, I received a few instruction and information emails, and even an option to book transportation direct from the airport. They also requested confirmation of arrival times and if any special needs were required, etc. I really appreciated this. A day or two before my arrival date, I again received a follow-up email confirming that nothing had changed.The staff here was just lovely and everyone was very helpful with the exception of one female staff member (maybe she was just having a bad week?) who we eventually just avoided asking for help at all, and that solved that! Our room was cleaned daily and we never had to request fresh towels or linens. For two travelers, there was ample space - keep in mind that the rooms all over Europe are often much smaller than what many are accustomed to. We never turned on the tv, but there was one in the room, along with a safe and a writing desk and chair. The beds were stiff but comfortable. My only complaint is that the walls were very thin and even thinner from the bathroom! In fact, we could hear our neighbors very clearly, when we stepped into the bathroom.The location is good for the price. You'll find you're about a 8-10 minute walk from both the Sagrada Familia and the Arc de Triomphe. For those that have purchased the double decker bus tickets or metro pass, you can find stations at both of these attractions. The major train station is only about a 6 minute walk away as well. To get to Casa Mila or Casa Batllo, it's about a 25 minute walk. Montjuic/ Magic Fountain, about 55 minutes. I took a walk to the bunkers one morning, and even at a pretty quick pace, it took me about 45 minutes. But this city is spread out and you'll need to expect to do some walking no matter what. Plus, you'll want to get in some extra activity after eating all of those tapas!For the frugal traveler who's always looking for a deal, like myself, this place was perfect. It was a decent location with good accommodations and enough space for 2 people comfortably. There are small markets just right across the street, for water, snacks & essentials. The ease of public transportation was also a big plus.","April 10, 2019","12    Hotel Acta Antibes

There's a 24h supermarket two doors down the street, and a metro station (Monumental) only 2 blocks away (less than 5 mins walk) which will take you downtown or up to La Sagrada Familia. The staff at the hotel were amazing (especially Eduardo) and the breakfast had plenty of choice and was regularly topped up. The room was small, but was clean & tidy. Unfortunately, the window of our room had no view at all (other than a brick wall and a fire exit), so very little light got into the room, but this wasn't of much concern as the room is only for sleeping in - not for sitting looking out the window all day. The beds were comfortable and clean, the aircon was good, there was a wardrobe and a safe. The bathroom was very very compact but had a sink, a bidet, a toilet, and a bath with a good shower in it. The only thing that would have been a nice extra would have been a small fridge to store drinks in, as it was quite warm and being able to keep drinks cold would have been good.","April 20, 2018","12    Hotel Acta Antibes

Despite having a room at the front, overlooking the street, the double windows kept out the noise and my sleep wasn't disturbed by traffic at all. The only disturbance was from people using the lift, so I'd recommend requesting a room away from that area.The very best thing about Acta Antibes was the friendliness of the reception staff. Without exception, I found them extremely accommodating, welcoming, and helpful, with advice about using public transport, finding places to eat, and general information.The location is great! The closest metro station is only a very short walk away, and a local bus stop is also close for an alternate way to get around. It's in a walkable and safe area, which is very important to me, being an older solo traveller.Breakfast is nothing special, but it's more than adequate and a reasonable cost for Barcelona standards.Yes, it's only a 2 star hotel but it presents as well above that.

710,"We booked a double room at the end of the high season and were therefore focused on avoiding the rip-off prices of other hotels in touristic areas.Acta Antibes is a 2-star establishment and one cannot expect the level of service and lost of amenities of a 4-star, but the basic requirements were met: clean room, bedsheets and bathroom, free wifi and friendly staff. The breakfast buffet was a bit limited in choice and its price was not included in the room. I found that it deserved to be, all things considered.The hotel location is not exceptional, but we already knew our way around in the city, so it was a minor inconvenience.For the purpose of our trip, Acta Antibes did the job, but it may not have all the frills regular tourists look for.","September 7, 2017","12    Hotel Acta Antibes

In the room was a dressing table and chair, a single sofa style chair next to the window. There was a mini bar fridge, large wardrobe with iron and ironing board. In the bath room was a bath with shower over (1 hand held wall mounted shower and an overhead rain head shower), large mirror over the sink and shaving/ makeup mirror, a bidet and toiletries such as shower gel, shampoo, conditioner, body moisturiser, comb, vanity kit and shower cap, there is also a hairdryer in the bathroom.I read in some reviews that the air conditioning didn’t work, ours worked fine. There is also complimentary Wi-fi throughout the hotel.The pool terrace is really modern with a mix of sun beds, cabanas, bean bags and bar stools. The pool had a jacuzzi section but it’s unheated so a little cool in the beginning of June. There’s a bar serving alcohol and soft drinks along with some cocktails and a bar menu serving sandwiches, pizzas etcWe opted for breakfast which gave a variety of buffet hot breakfast, continental breakfast and pastries. There are cereals, fresh fruit and juices along with self serve tea and coffee. We really enjoyed it and was served from 7am-10am.We only had one drink in the bar but it was nice.All the staff were helpful and welcoming and although not in the centre of Barcelona, we walked along the Promenade to the centre, it took about 50 mins. There is a taxi tank outside the hotel and there is a bus stop across the road, we saw the open top bus pass frequently, for those who don’t want to walk.We chose to get a private taxi back to the airport and it took around 45 mins but the traffic was very heavy and cost €40.If I come back to Barcelona this hotel would be top of my list.","June 7, 2019","13    Occidental Atenea Mar - Adults only

754,"My friend and I have just returned home from staying at this hotel. Lovely lovely stay from start to finish. We arrived a little early but we were able to leave our bags at reception. We went for a stroll outside, to find a row of about 4/5 restaurants just to the right of the hotel entrance. Sat down and had some sangria and tapas. Beaut. Went back to check in to our room, room lovely, bonus we were right on the front in a superior room with a sea view. You can hear the noise from outside but it’s not unbearable.Hotel is spotless everywhere, can’t fault it, from the room, the lifts and communal areas. Breakfast had a really good choice compared to European standards, this was included in our rate, but would pay for breakfast if it wasn’t.We made use of the sauna - 3 different types, but not the pool. The beach is just over the road so we spent one of ours days there. Location - perfect for the beach and taxi’s into the city centre (La Rambla, Sagrada Família etc) were only around €15. Plenty around. One of the stops for the Barcelona Bus Turistic hop on hop off bus is right by the hotel too, which helps. We bought tickets from reception and got a discount. Would defo recommend this hotel and would absolutely stay again! Thanks to all the friendly and helpful staff too!","May 30, 2019","13    Occidental Atenea Mar - Adults only

757,"Atenea Mar is far from the downtown, but the neighborhood is nice though. The sea shore is very near, if you have the time to stroll on the beach. The nearest subway station is about 10 min away, and a ride costs about 2 euro per person. I had a premium room to begin with but the noise from the motorway was very heavy so I asked for another room facing the backyard. The first room was bigger and the second one quiet so it was an easy choice. The breakfast was good, but in the evening we had to find some other place for dinner since the hotel restaurant was closed. Also the pool was closed which was a bit disappointing.","May 27, 2019","13    Occidental Atenea Mar - Adults only

758,"With great views from the bedroom, a humongous double bed and continental breakfast, this hotel made our trip to Barcelona a joy. The staff were all exceptionally friendly and helpful and assisted us whenever we needed direction or advice on the best ways to go into the city/travelling/things to do.The breakfast buffet had different fresh fruits every day, with a range of pastries, cereals, breads, meats and cheese, as well as a hot selection which we did not opt for but seemed very popular. The coffee machines served great coffee, and there was a selection of fruit juices too. The pool was freezing (may) and the weather was quite windy during our stay but managed to sunbathe every afternoon on the terrace. The bar is a little pricey but doesn’t break the bank and the sangria is well worth it!the bar staff were all lovely and very helpful, with the drinks and complimentary snack mix brought to our sun beds. The hotel also has 2 saunas and a steam room, as well as a small but well furnished gym. Depending on which lift you take depends whether you have to walk through the underground car park to get to it, but is about a 5 second walk and not nearly as bad as some of the reviews state!4 given for location purely due to the 25-35 minutes into Barcelona centre, however this was something we knew when booking and what we had opted for - the price you pay for staying in a nice hotel! There weren’t that many paces within walking distance such as restaurants and bars, but a short walk out would take you a range of eating places at the diagonal mar shopping centre, or in the opposite direction along the beachfront were many smaller bars - often there is someone outside trying to drag you in which we hated, but always checked out the menu ourselves and decided. Overall I would definitely go back to this hotel, even if it was just to enjoy the breakfast again! Lovely hotel overall with staff to match.

763,"Overall I was impressed with the service and overall quality of the hotel. Upon check. The kindly receptionist provided us with a brief guide of the local key areas, closest metro information which is great for a first time visit to Barcelona. Altho I had researched all this proper. The closest metro is roughly a ten minute walk and a small mall with mc Donalds is a similar distance away too. With the beach in front and several restaurants close by. You have everything you need closeby. They also allow hire of electric scooters which unfortunately we did not get round to using. But they seemed very popular in the local area. The room was clean and in Barcelona tradition, maybe Spanish tradition, there was no lock to the bathroom. The hotel isnt in the centre of the city and instead is in the far corner, results in having to take generally more than one metro line to get back after a day out.

765,"We were greeted warmly at reception by Raquel who described the hotel and provided us with a map showing nearby restaurants and metro stations. The Metro in Barcelona is brilliant, only 1 euro to anywhere, also there are more taxis than you can poke a stick at and they are very reasonable. Our room was clean and a decent size with a bath/shower however there was some black mould round the bath which some bleach would have sorted out. As ever in hotels nowadays the toilet paper was ribbon thin what a ridiculously petty ay to save money. There were 5 coat hangers for two of us for four days and no drawers. We asked for more but they were not forthcoming. A kettle and coffee were provided which was great but once again only one cup each was provided, we went to a supermarket and bought milk and some nescafe (far cheaper than UK) so that we could have a coffee in the afternoon. Other than that the sea views are really pleasant. The lower rooms can be a bit noisy because of the roads and multi coloured limbed moronic brits returning from clubs, luckily not staying at the Occidental. On the very plus side the beds are super comfortable and have 3 pillows of various sizes. Needless to say the TV provides ""Russia Today"" but not BBC. That is not good enough and many hotels in Europe are as bad.Breakfast is excellent with a very varied buffet including Cava but your breakfast is confined to side plates, again petty money saving. The result is that that you actually use more plates. Piped music is thought to enhance your eating experience.The pool area is excellent although there were not enough mattresses for the sunbeds, again, a bit petty. Pool music drones on. Why do we need music at breakfast or when we are trying to relax by the pool?Both the pool bar and the main bar are not too pricey and have atmosphere.We did not eat in the restaurant at night because it opened at 8.All in all a nice hotel with friendly staff but the silly money saving does it no favours.","May 2, 2019","13    Occidental Atenea Mar - Adults only

Room was very well sized and the bed was huge. 3 of us stayed in 1 triple room, thought we would all have to share but they brought in an extra bed which allowed for more space. Bathroom was lovely, really appreciated all the amenities that came with room like additional smaller mirror, plenty of towels, all small essentials such as shower gels, caps, combs, vanity kits, and most importantly hairdryer! Would have liked to have tried the pool if it was not winter (which pool is closed over) and if staying again would consider trying their breakfast as room also looked lovely.One thing to note is if visiting Barcelona for many city architecture and sights, it can take up to an hour to walk as hotel is near to beach, however wasn’t an issue to find shopping centre and food places nearby.

790,"I stayed here over new years. I emailed the hotel to say it was my birthday and I got an upgrade of a room. I had booked a sea view already. I booked via booking.com who later wrote to me saying that I could not be guaranteed a sea view room. I wrote to the hotel directly who wrote back saying that I would be getting a sea view room.  The pool is shut for most of the year. I found this out on check in. This should be better advertised. There was also a problem obtaining room service. I had asked in Spanish first and then English for a bottle of water to be brought to the room. This took four phone calls to happen and I was also told to go to the store to get water. I was given very helpful and friendly advice by Francesca regarding sight seeing. On check out, I left a mobile phone in the room. I realised this at the airport and called the hotel. Francesca immediately obtained the phone and put it in the hotel safe. She then directed that I email the hotel with the details of what had happened. I did this and was contacted by the postal company. The phone was delivered to the address in Dublin exactly 48 hours after it was left in the hotel. I place the cause of this directly with Francesca whose diligence and professionalism ensured that the phone would be retrieved and returned within such a short time. I think that Francesca should receive a commendation from the Barcelo Group for her actions in dealing with this. Many thanks Francesca. ","January 3, 2019","13    Occidental Atenea Mar - Adults only

Liz & Tony were very helpful, great communication before we arrived & they also very kindly arranged for a birthday cake & cava to be there on arrival, as a surprise from me to my friends (great choice of cake Liz, it was lovely!).Liz & Tony recommended the bus tour which we enjoyed & some great local places to eat, one of which we got delicious takeaway pizza & pasta to take back to The Patio to eat.

The other room does have an outside window and as we always sleep with an open window we would choose that next time. The bathroom is well appointed and even though its shared between the 2 rooms there was never an issue. If your are of a shy disposition you may want to take a dressing gown but it wasn't an issue for us. There was a choice of breakfast, cold meats and cheeses, cereals, toast and a freshly made fruit salad every day.

If you have a problem with Spanish, they will give you really good advice (maps/tkts and explanations) on what to see and where to go in english. The location is a few steps away from the metro station. It takes you approx. 7-10 minutes to get downtown to the Ramblas. I myself own a Bed & Breakfast in Bern Switzerland and have high standards. Next time I go to Barcelona, I will definately stay at B&B The Patio. Oh I almost forgot, if the weather is nice, there is a beautiful huge roof patio with chairs and a nice view.

832,"Perfect B&B in Barcelona! This is a private 2 bedroom, 1 bathroom, dining/living room apartment across the hall from Elizabeth and Tony, who are the owners and are fabulous hosts! Walking home to the secure building made us feel like locals. Safe neighborhood and good location for walking to the highlights of Barcelona. The apartment has its own entrance. We, 2 couples, stayed 4 nights in Dec/Jan. The walls are brick and so very charming, warm and welcoming. Everything was spotless: bedrooms, linens, bathroom, towels changed daily, heated towel rack in each bedroom so if you want to wash out a belonging or two it would be dry in the morning. Beds were comfortable. The apartment has some lovely antique pieces. The breakfast was huge and so much more than we could eat. The table was set every morning and Elizabeth was there to help us with tons of information on things to do. She had a taxi waiting for us at the airport when we arrived and made arrangements for one when we were heading for the ship. We would stay here over and over. Very reasonable prices! Quiet and peaceful. In the warmer months there is a lovely patio or an upstairs roof garden to enjoy. We were there on New Year's Eve, an incredible event at the Plaza de Espangna.","February 6, 2016","14    The Patio Barcelona

Looking for a perfect place? You are in the best one. The localization is great (so close to the metro station and to the city center), the neighbourhood is quiet... and the patio... it is one of the nicest place I have ever stayed in. Walls made of bare bricks, framed pictures, antique fernitures and chandeliers hanging from ceilings. There are also many conveniences like air conditioning or free WiFi. The Patio wouldn’t be so charming and warm place without a friendly and helpful couple - Liz and Tony. Thanks to them we felt there so welcome and homely. They were always ready to give an advice, explain the route, tell the joke or just to chat. They are always around when you need them. The Patio isn't an ordinary place. It can be your second home during your best holidays ever.","September 2, 2015","14    The Patio Barcelona

842,"The localization of The Patio is perfect - in a quiet and peaceful area near center of Barcelona. The metro station (Entenca) is just across the street. And the nearest attractions of Barcelona are about 15-20 minutes walk from The Patio (Placa d’Espanya, Magic Fountain of Montjuic, Museu Nacional d’Art de Catalunya...). So it’s a great starting point to tour the city.When you arrive, at first you may be a little surprised - to get to The Patio you need to pass through two gates and corridor of an ordinary apartment house, one of many on the street. Then you go through the narrow courtyard decorated with lots of plants, and finally when you pass the door in the end… you feel like Alice on the other side of the mirror.The inside of The Patio looks like from different century - walls made of bare bricks, framed pictures on them, antique fernitures and chandeliers hanging from ceilings and giving some light to shaded rooms…The Patio has two bedrooms, dining room and bathroom. Our bedroom had no window, which surprisingly for me was good, because it increased the magic of the place. And from XXI century the room is equipped with electricity ;) air conditioning, fan and free WiFi.But The Patio wouldn’t be so extraordinary, familiar and warm place without charming couple: Elizabeth and Tony - they are the wizzards of the place - very kind, warm, tactful and helpful. They are always around when you need them. And when you get an advise or help or even just a while of chat, which I enjoyed very much - they became noisless and invisible… Sometimes you can feel their presence only by the fact that the dishes after breakfest are gone or cups and plates are prepared for the next morning…And the breakfasts are delicious. Elizabeth always cares about it and if it's possible she even tries to customize menu to the taste of the guests.So if you want to experience the magic - The Patio is the place you’re looking for.","August 23, 2015","14    The Patio Barcelona

The next morning at breakfast she sat with me at breakfast to help plan my day and where to eat . I felt really welcome and would definitely return. As there are only 2 rooms Liz tries to include everyone (max 4) at breakfast and I met a lovely American mother and son on the second day.

863,"The very convenient airport Aerobus terminates at Plaza de Catalunya.However, took us 30 mins walk uphill on Passeig de Gracia avenue to Blanc, and towing our luggages - was a real drag uphill. The next few days, even walking from the metro station Diagonal to Blanc took us 10 mins. It's a hassle esp when we're already feeling tired out the whole day and under the summer blazing sun. Blanc is located on a premium street with high end pubs/bar/bistro, however not rowdy. Coming back late, one really have to crept very quietly around the corridor as this is not a hotel; it's really a huge apartment with many rooms, i think at least 16 rooms. I think some rooms rate are without bathroom en suite - and those guests would have to the common bath/toilet - although clean, can be a hassle esp for womenfolk, not to mention noise which other reviews seem to unanimously complained; didn't bother us as we were doggoned tired; hopefully our own snore didn't wake the dead. Our room's only window faces the inside central air well (ventilation shaft) - didn't overly vexed us as we went out immediately after breakfast and came back only when the carriage turned into a pumpkin . Room, linen, pillow, bed,.. all clean. Bed firm, light just enough. Wifi was strong enough as all our 200 photos of the day were uploaded into google overnight. Because of its premium location, the rates are higher. Other hotels closer metro Diagonal or Plaza de Catalunya - might be comparable even if the rates be the same, but one saves in walking distance & time. But perhaps walking 10-20 mins might not bother others; we're just soggy after a wholeday out on foot. Arriving for the first time, passed 10pm, you will have to pay EUR20 extra charge for a special staff to open and register you in. Fine print of our online booking sheet stated that. Subsequent nights we have access card & key to come in anytime of the day and night.Breakfast is pretty filling & good quality comprising buffet of ham, cheese, pastries, muesli, toast, bread, OJ, tea, free flow coffee machine (good); sitting in an enclosed terrace (see pix) Has two 24hrs grocers about 3 mins walk around it. During the day there's a supermarket just 3 mins walk away.a plus for Blanc is that it's easy to catch a bus or metro from Gracias, to Tibidabo, the cathedral on a mountain (good view of Barcelona) and some beautiful quaint gaudy houses along the way there.","October 28, 2016","15    Blanc Guesthouse

870,"The guesthouse has inexpensive rooms including Room 1 with its own bath facing the street. There is a coumpter and sitting area. The rooms are quite small and very plain, but clean and a good value. The street in front is VERY quiet. We heard almost nothing in 3 daysThe staff wqs very helpful and checkin easy. There is a small sign to the left of the door and you buzz them to get in the building. There are limited checkin hours and I would suggest calling first during the day so they can meet you at the street.The metro is a 10 minute walk. Fine with 1 suitcase, too far with more. Breakfast has excellent pasteries and other goodies. An outside terrace sitting area available in nice weather.A good value for a basic clean and safe place to stay in Barcelona.","May 18, 2016","15    Blanc Guesthouse

872,"My husband and I stayed at the Blanc guesthouse for 4 nights recently. The staff were really helpful both before and during our stay. The guesthouse is located on the first floor of a multi-story building. There was a lovely smell as soon as you entered the building and the guesthouse itself was spotlessly clean and beautifully decorated. Breakfast was good, complimentary hot drinks were available all day and a selection of drinks and snacks available to purchase for a small fee. There was also a nice outside terrace area and complimentary wi-fi and computers. The location is good, about a 10 minute walk from the nearest bus tour stop and metro stations nearby. Overall we had a wonderful stay and would recommend this guesthouse. The only downside was the fact that we were in room 1 which is next door to the bathroom for other guests to use and so had to put up with the noise (and smells) whenever it was in use.","April 27, 2016","15    Blanc Guesthouse

875,"This guest house is in the most perfect location for all amenities and places of interest, the guesthouse is absolutely immaculate in all areas and it also smells very nice, it is very well maintained with extremely kind and helpful hosts who are always willing to help, our stay was was lovely but it could of been improved by the shared bathroom and also the breakfast, the shared bathroom which was for three other rooms was right next door to us in the corner which meant that we had a constant stream of people visiting and showering at all various times throughout the day, night and early hours of the morning, they had to walk past our door to enter and leave and also the door lock was really loud it was very disturbing and we found it to be quite annoying as heels on the tiled floor also did not help, we had our own bathroom but it almost felt that every one else was using it too due to the closeness of their bathroom next to our bedroom, the breakfast was poor with very little choice, I had to supply my own as there was no fruit or eggs and no choice of cereals, on the whole we did have a very nice holiday in Barcelona and we would definitely stay at the Blanc guest again if it could have a few little changes which are important and do mean a lot to holiday makers.","April 17, 2016","15    Blanc Guesthouse

877,"I want to say lovely things about this hotel; the staff are friendly, the breakfast is nice, the rooms look adorable and it's cleaned to perfection.However, it is impossible to get a good sleep. You can hear absolutely everything. There's no sleep until at least midnight when everyone else goes to sleep and your woken up by the noise of guests and breakfast from 7am; not to mention anyone coming in at night or going to the bathroom. It's not that they're particularly noisy either - it's just the walls are so thin. One night someone decided to take a 30 minute shower at 1am and our room was so noisy from the pipes it woke both me and my partner up and we couldn't get back to sleep until they had finished. Our holiday was made pretty awful by the fact we're tired every day as we stayed for five nights. With being able to hear every noise, it also took away any privacy which meant there was no romance. Not for all guests though, as we heard ""nighttime activities"" from another room - which woke us up at 5am. We spoke to the staff who changed our room to the other side of the hotel and it wasn't as bad but still too noisy for a good sleep. This B&B is good for people on business trips who are looking for short stays with Late nights and early mornings but definitely NOT for couples, relaxing holidays or longer stays. Would never ever stay here again and regret ever booking. ","March 13, 2016","15    Blanc Guesthouse

I was in the small room with the en-suite bathroom which was perfect for me & very comfortable, the bathroom was nice, modern and big. My room was located in the entrance of the breakfast area but noise was never a problem for me. The breakfast had enough of a variety.My parents stayed in a bigger room which was also very nice.

As for the nightlife, Blanc Guesthouse is located down the block from Sutton, which is one of the hottest clubs in town. If you're not into the nightclub scene, there are about four bars located on the same street as Blanc. Despite the nightlife scene in this area, I didn't feel like it was noisy at all.

Lots of leaflets and maps just incase you didn't bring one with you.Location is good, just off via diagonal where there is a metro, bus and some lovely restaurants. There is a 24h bakery just a bit down from the guesthouse which was definitely worth admiring!The only problem we faced was when the electric went out one night in which the air con system restarted and made an on/off very high pitched sound most of the night.

891,"First things first: the Blanc Guesthouse was friendly, welcoming and clean and I would cheerfully stay there again.My room was pleasant though there was hardly any natural light since the small window looks out onto a narrow space between buildings. The bedside light was inconvenient, with switches either high above the bed or you could get up and use the wall switch.There were a few other annoyances. The first was when I discovered that my credit card (from online booking) was charged at a poor rate since I had been billed in UK pounds rather than Euro. I *always* choose to be billed in the local currency so I have no idea how this happened; perhaps I missed a checkbox. Since this is always poor value for the customer it should default the other way.Second, the rooms are not well soundproofed, which has a few consequences. One is that the (excellent) free coffee and tea is not allowed to be used before 8.00am or late at night. Since I tend to get up around 6.30am this meant I had to go out to get a drink; luckily there is a baker nearby which does coffee early but it would have been nice to be able to make my own drink.I am not convinced that disallowing the coffee machine has much benefit, since you can still hear people taking an early shower which I suspect is noisier.I only had breakfast at the Blanc once, on a Sunday morning; it was fine though I would have liked some fresh bread or pastries; maybe you get this on other days.There is an outside terrace which is nice for sitting outside though not really scenic as the view is the back of other buildings; still very pleasant on a warm evening though.I did like the location, on a quiet street which is not too touristy but has some bars and bakeries; the excellent Barcelona metro system is about 10 mins walk away.","March 7, 2015","15    Blanc Guesthouse

Everything was super clean and our towels were changed every other day. We appreciated the free coffee & tea outside our apartment and the different pastries at breakfast every day. The only slight problem was the noise that came from the breakfast area after 9 a.m. If one wants to sleep more than this it is not easy. The location of the B&B was good as it is between the city center and Gracia area which we really liked. The metro is a 10min walk but you can ask about buses that are nearby.

Our stay there reflected Ferran’s long-term experience, dedication to guest comfort, and commitment to providing high quality, comfortable, stylish, exceptionally convenient, and well-appointed accommodations. We had reserved a room with a private bath, so we were accommodated at the annex flat near the main flat. The main flat is appointed in a colorful, eclectic, sophisticated, and comfortable style. Though we weren’t staying at this location, we saw most of the rooms and thought that the rooms we saw were spacious and well-maintained. Though we liked the main flat, we loved the annex flat where our room was located. It’s a beautiful, well-maintained 100+ year-old building, right on Plaça Urquinaona. You just can’t beat the access to the Metro and buses, just across the street. Likewise, the flat is two blocks from Plaça Catalunya and Passeig Gracia and one block from the Gothic Quarter. It’s a 15-minute walk to the water and about 30 minutes to La Sagrada Familia. Pro Tip: Café Citizen is right next door. Awesome coffee, fresh juice, really good salads, tasty desserts, and friendly staff, if you are in the mood to take an afternoon break from site seeing. Specifically about our room and the flat, there are three rooms at this location, all of which are shown on the Barcino webpage. Our room was on the back of the building and it was very quiet with no street noise. We had a private bath and a separate sitting area, in addition to the bedroom. The bedroom was large but not huge, and the grand scale of the flat, the high ceilings, and its detail and decoration really made us feel luxuriously accommodated. Again, the colors and appointments in the flat are bold and eclectic, which was perfect for us. As a B&B, we used the common area living room/salon to relax in a grand space that overlooks Plaça Urquinaona. The flat feels like - and is - someplace special. We have to note how comfortable the bed and air conditioning were. We slept great. Unusually, we had our own thermostat and were able to keep the room temperature to our liking. Lastly, breakfast was enjoyable. It’s a Continental breakfast. Every morning, we chose from a variety of options: toast, jams, hard-boiled eggs, cheese, cold cuts, various fresh fruits, yogurt, coffee, cereal, and juices. We especially enjoyed eating at the table in the kitchen, where we could meet and share our experiences and recommendations with the other guests. This is much of why we chose the B&B experience at Barcino 147. We left the B&B with a strong desire to return with family or friends, because the flat would be a great choice to call home while visiting Barcelona.

907,"My arrival at Barcino 147 was a bit serendipitous; I ended up here after my original bed & breakfast lost my reservation. I really lucked out, as Barcino 147 is in a central location, convenient to everything, and only 4 blocks from Place de Catalunya, 6 from Las Ramblas. I arrived just after 10:00pm and found the staff to be extremely friendly and welcoming. I stayed for 5 nights, and found the experience to be like a home away from home. It was a little bit like a boarding house with a large shared kitchen, and 8-10 rooms off the hallway. Each room was carefully decorated with wall art, sconces, and furniture that made it seem homey; not sterile like a hotel. The entry from the street was like entering any apartment from the street, through a spacious foyer and into an elevator.The apartment was well renovated and modern, but as with buildings of its age, sound did travel down the hallways if people were talking in the halls or with their room doors open. There was a courtyard/ air shaft either within the building, or between the building and the adjoining one where men could be heard outside talking loudly at 1:00am one evening. However, it was quiet for the majority of the time, and the other guests were overwhelming courteous.","July 14, 2018","16    Barcino 147 Bed & Breakfast

908,"My husband I recently traveled to Barcelona, and I knew just where I wanted to stay. From my travels years before, I remembered staying at this delightful and unique Bed & Breakfast in Barcelona. Well, I looked up Barcino 147, and sure enough it was still open and very highly reviewed on Trip Advisor. I was delighted to see the name of the owner, Ferran, in several of the reviews. I met Ferran 10 years ago when i was studying abroad in Spain. My friends and I spent a few nights at Barcino 147, and he couldn't have been more hospitable. Everything from the unique decor to the close proximity to many places made this an ideal place to stay. We also loved getting to know Ferran. I remember chatting with him from everything about the local culture to jazz music. 10 years later, my husband and I were welcomed once again to this lovely place. It's not what you may expect - a hidden away Bed & Breakfast / Apartment-style that blends in with the rest of the buildings on the street. We actually stayed in the apartment separate from the other Bed & Breakfast rooms. It was absolutely lovely (see photos). We also got to meet Mari (spelling?) who was somewhat new to the team, but was delightful! She welcomed us to the room and took such good care of us with breakfast and keeping our room tidy and beautiful. I cannot say enough about this place. I mean, after all, it was a place I remembered from my travels before. You can tell that Ferran truly cares about the guests who stay at his establishment. I was so impressed that he remembered me and gave us such a warm welcome.If you want an eclectic, fun and authentically-Barcelona experience, stay here! We were so glad we stayed here, and I know we'll be back someday when we travel to Spain again! Gracias, Ferran!","July 1, 2018","16    Barcino 147 Bed & Breakfast

Breakfast was served every morning with an array of food that was delicious and gave us enough enery for our three days (not enough) in Barcelona. Ferrer made sure everything was good for us. We would go back again and have recommended it to a few people that we met on the cruise that followed our stay at Barcino 147.

The place is beautiful and just in the perfect spot, not far from Sagrada Familia and Barri Gotic. There are plenty of bars and restaurants within a few minutes.I was a single traveller and actually stayed at the owner Ferran's apartment; the room there is massive and the decor and style are brilliant. Ferran and I discussed a bit of the history of Catalonia, the politics etc., but I stress he did not push this on me, I initiated discussions. On the day I was checking out I asked to leave my suitcase in the apartment. Ferran said this would be fine, but could he have the key to give to the new guests?He trusted me so much he gave me his personal key as he was going to be in all day, which also had his car key on it. He runs the place in this same personal, open and trusting way.","April 19, 2018","16    Barcino 147 Bed & Breakfast

915,"I’m one of the lucky few Americans who gets to visit Barcelona regularly. It’s been 12 years now, and I always stay at Barcino 147 B&B. It is the classic, stylish Barcelona apartment and in a great location. But the reason people stay here is that they feel they are experiencing the real Barcelona – the way a Catalan would. Owned by artist and playwright Ferran Font, it is filled with beautiful furniture and art and is infused with the personality of the city. And to make your stay complete, I cannot recommend enough asking for Ferran to take you on a tour of the city or the countryside, even for a few hours. There is no better introduction to the city. The result? You feel connected. Barcelona is not a city to be viewed as a tourist would. Rather, it should be experienced. If you want an experience, and to feel connected to the city, I would encourage you to try Barcino 147 B&B.","April 5, 2018","16    Barcino 147 Bed & Breakfast

My friends were soooo happy with the location, basically 5 minutes walk, we could reach Passiege de Gracia, Gothic corner and Plaza Catalunya. I saw some reviews mentioned the shared bathroom and I never had problem with it. Not sure why people saying that, it's like “picking bones from eggs”.

920,"We took the Montserrat Suite. It only met the definition of a suite if you considered a bedroom with an ensuite bathroom as a suite. This definition would make every modern hotel room a suite. There as a bedroom and a bathroom. Most rooms did not feature an ensuite and shared common bathrooms. This lead to partially clothed people in the hall in the morning.The room was nice. The room featured a large leather couch which also had an attached day bed. There was adequate storage space but there was no table, other than nightstands, and no desk. The bathroom was good sized and fully featured.The problem was not with the room but management suffered.We had e-mailed them our train arrival time at the station and said that we would immediately take a cab to the B&B. After they received our e-mail they e-mailed us asking when we would arrive.We responed by repeating the information, but when we arrived at the building the buidling receptionist (The B&B is a large apartment on a floor of a multi floor building.) said that she would have to contact the owner who could let us in and he should be there in about ten minutes. Yes he was there in about ten minutes but since they knew our arrival plans we thought that someone should have been there to let us in. The owner informed us that he really was not into the registration process and that the manager would be there later to fill us in on any details.The back of our room had a litany of penalties for any damages done to the premises including 40 euros if we spotted the sheets and 20 euros if we spotted a pillow case. There was also a list of penalties for lost keys.During our five night stay the towels in the room were never changed. This was not a motel 6 as we were spending over $200 per night.The ""manager"" was a pleasant enough young woman who had a room in the premises but appeared to have no hospitality industry experience. She would be around (or not) as her daily routine allowed.Breakfast was ""served"" in a crowded narrow kitchen with about half as many chairs as occupants of the B&B. Breakfast was put out in the time and quantities as the ""manager"" opted for. One morning she forgot to put out any juice and another morning one of the guests took the last slice of bread for toast until she decided to put out more bread. There was no butter just a tub of margarine. A notice said that guests could choose to take breakfast in their rooms but were encouraged to eat witht the other guests. There was no table to eat on in the room and the kitchen table could not seat all the guests. The kitchen also doubled as her office and if she was seated at the computer it made it hard to use all of the chairs at the table.When we checked out at about 10:00 A.M. after our five night stay one of the manager's friends was around and said that the manager was not there because she thought that we would be there until the noon check out time. We made certain to leave our highly valued keys and left since everything had been paid in advance.It appears that the owner has an arrangement with a young student to act as manager, probably in return for a room.Although, the location was excellent and the room was good, our stay was largely a disappointment.","November 9, 2017","16    Barcino 147 Bed & Breakfast

Be sure to note whether you want a private bath or not because only a couple rooms have them; the common bathroom did get a little jammed at rush hour, with people waiting in the hall. Perfect location on the periphery of several different zones, making it a great place to sample most of what Barcelona has to offer, all within a 20 minute walk. Highly recommended.

923,"My daughter and I stayed at Barcino 147 for three days this September after I had to quickly rebook a spot since my original booking somewhere else was cancelled. I like the idea of a more personal spot than just a regular hotel. Barcino 147 was in the perfect location for us - only a couple of blocks from the Aerobus stop and Placa Catalunya - also walking distance to Sagrada Familia and the Gothic Quarter. We walked all over much of the city from here. Barcino 147 was spotlessly clean, and the breakfast supplied was adequate. The coffee was good and the water cooler was appreciated. We were given a good sized room on the 6th floor with a queen bed facing the street. It was very comfy. I think it was a bit better room than we had booked which I really appreciated. The street noise was quite loud, but we actually enjoyed it - kind of a hum for sleeping. The A/C and wifi were both very good. When you arrive at the main door, you have to buzz to get let in. The check in is on the 2nd floor. My only apprehension was that we had issues with our keys a couple of times. There are 3 keys before you get into your room, and a couple times we actually needed help after messing with them many times. Because there was no one there in the after hours and all we had was a phone number, I was kind of nervous we would get locked out later in the evening. We were given Ferran's phone number, but we weren't even sure how to dial a European number on our phone, so thankfully we didn't have to. What would someone do who didn't have their own phone? Also, we never ever met Ferran, so I wouldn't have felt comfortable trying to get him to solve a problem. We had a small shared bathroom, and fortunately, there were only a couple other people using it. I can see how it could be uncomfortable if a lot had to share it. The quad room on our floor remained empty; otherwise, that would have been a lot of people sharing one small bathroom. They keep older looking used hand towels in the bathroom. I would suggest some paper towels for people to at least dry their hands with. As I've read in the past, those used towels are not very attractive hanging in the shared bathroom. Also, the bathroom is way too hot and it should have a better fan system. All noises carry horribly which is uncomfortable for everyone. There should be some kind of cooling and fan system that reaches the bathroom and central areas. I enjoyed speaking to Jimena (not sure how to spell it) - one of the ladies who was there in the mornings. She was very helpful. One day, the maid neglected to do our room at all - not sure why. We were gone most of the day. The elevator worked well but was very small and also very hot. A community sitting room with couches/chairs would have been nice to sit for coffee/etc. The very small kitchen with tiny stools wasn't a convenient sitting area. Quynn (not sure of spelling) was very kind and helpful. The only other negative I have is that they billed my credit card for the largest portion of our bill in Canadian funds instead of Euro without asking me. The receipt clearly says I should have been asked, and if I had have been I would have said please bill in Euro as when you bill in CAD, there is a bigger percentage charged than my own credit card would have. Overall, our stay was alright - our room was comfortable and we slept well. However, because of the things I've mentioned, I don't think I would stay here again.","September 24, 2017","16    Barcino 147 Bed & Breakfast

Each morning a very satisfying continental breakfast was prepared and waiting for us in the kitchen, which made for a great start to the day.The decor and furnishings are just beautiful, and reflect Ferran's appreciation and love of art and fine things...

925,"This B&B is quite good, it's very tidy and the staff is friendly and helpful. However, if you book a room without a private bathroom, it might be a bit stressful in the mornings. I don't know how many people had to share the two bathrooms but at certain times it's almost impossible it get to the bathroom or the toilet (as they're in the bathroom). Also, I had a room next to the bathroom which meant that I woke up every morning at around 5a.m. to people having a shower who came home from partying or having to catch a flight in the morning. I heard ALL the bathroom/shower noises imaginable (someone farting, vomiting or cleaning their palate is not the nicest thing to wake up to). Anytime someone opened their door with a key I thought they were actually trying to pick my lock, which gave me almost a heart attack at 3 in the morning.So, the rooms are very clean (unfortunately, the person cleaning the room also tidied up my stuff - which means, organizing my make-up/bottles, putting my shoes neatly under my bed etc and threw away half-full bottles of water), the staff is nice, the breakfast is okay. All in all - nothing bad to say about the accommodation, just the other guests kind of ruined my stay there.","August 15, 2017","16    Barcino 147 Bed & Breakfast

This property is nicely maintained, clean and smells good, located just a few block or 5 minutes from a large shopping center and close to many nice restaurants (Thumbs up of that!).The Suite Room we booked itself was much larger than many B&B we stayed in Europe with Double beds, flat screen TV, “strong” wi-fi , many wall outlets allowing us to recharge laptop & cellphones. Pillows were better than normal in that they were full, providing something nice to sleep on. (I guess its memory foam pillow)Breakfast was provided in the Dining area consisted of boiled eggs, toast, fruit, cereal, coffee and tea.

This bed and breakfast is very central, few steps from the old gothic area and the famous Ramblas.The room was a bit small but fully funcional and comfortable. Our room was well decorated and trendy, with cable TV. Best pillows I have ever slept on. Everything you need is here, hairdryer, iron, strong air conditioning, and plenty of places to grab a bite in the area! Great tapas bars! Convenient place for sightseeing-perfect location. Easy to get there from the airport by bus. You can have tea and coffee at any time in the morning or in the evening. Highly recommended!","June 5, 2017","16    Barcino 147 Bed & Breakfast

Our room was amazing, very big and luxurious! The view of Barcelona was incredible, and the breakfast was delicious. The staff also wrote us a personal note and gave us a gift for it being our honeymoon. So thoughtful! Were very helpful and friendly. Everything was spotlessly clean. Lots of local restaurants and bars nearby with interesting tapas places. Prices higher than we thought though so didn't really bother us because the quality was good for what you are getting.","May 30, 2017","16    Barcino 147 Bed & Breakfast

936,"From the moment we stepped through the doors, the staff at Barcino 147 went above and beyond. (Special thanks to Mari, in particular, for always graciously assisting us!) We were given personalized recommendations for things to do around the city, and never felt like it would be uncomfortable to ask for more information. The owner of Barcino 147, Ferran, went so far out of his way to accommodate us, it felt like we were his oldest, and most personal friends. He is genuinely kind, considerate, and accessible; not only did we see and speak with him often during our stay, but he also freely gives out his personal number, and responds to messages and calls immediately. I always felt that we had a safety net in Barcelona, should we need help with anything at all. The location of Barcino 147 is ideal! It is a straightforward walk, literally two blocks away from the center of everything. My mother and I did not have to use public transport once our entire time in Barcelona (but the metro stop is very close to the establishment, if you prefer to use it!) The area is also very safe, so one can feel comfortable walking late at night. The rooms were well appointed, the beds were large and very comfortable, the heat and water pressure in the shower were both excellent, and everything was spectacularly clean. We were even upgraded to a much larger room when it became available, at no additional cost. The breakfast was perfect, and served between the hours of 8-11AM. My mother and I thoroughly enjoyed the fresh bread, gorgeous boiled eggs, jam, butter, milk, and made-to-order Nespresso coffee. There were a number of other options for us to choose from, including a variety of cereals, biscotti, and yogurt, but we kept going back to the aforementioned. When the bread was running low, Mari even offered to run down to the bakery and purchase more!I have stayed at a large number of B&Bs and hotels in several different countries, and the customer service here is the best I've ever come across. It is clear that everyone that works at Barcino 147 loves what they do, and that makes all the difference the world. For the life of me, I can't understand why anyone would rate this amazing B&B lower than 5 stars. I would give 10, if I could. Barcino 147 is the #1 B&B in Barcelona.

The apartment was huge and beautifully decorated. It had a separate kitchen where a wonderful Spanish breakfast was served daily. Ferran made certain that we had our full privacy and flexibility, while being very personable and hospitable. He gave us great tips about transportation, restaurants, and sightseeing.

The staff was lovely and very helpful. We arrived too early to check in but were given a place to leave our luggage, clean up, and given breakfast. We never did see the owner but the staff was very nice and helpful. We also opted to pay the extra and have door to door pickup at the airport, which made getting off a red-eye from NY a lot easier to deal with at 7:30AM.Our only (slight) minus was the breakfast set-up. Their rooms are on 2 different floors of what appears to be an apartment building, and when you stay on the 4th floor there is an actual breakfast room with a table and chairs. When you stay on the 6th floor, where we were, the kitchen really didn't have a place to sit for breakfast so you had to take a tray to your room, but our room didn't have a table, so it was awkward trying to eat and balance a cup of coffee. Other than that it was a great bargain and and close to most of what we came to Barcelona to see. Beds are comfortable too. We did opt to pay extra for one of the two rooms with in-suite bathrooms but even with that extra fee it was still very reasonable for a hotel room in Barcelona.","October 19, 2016","16    Barcino 147 Bed & Breakfast

Furthermore, Catalonian style of interior makes you to feel that you are an actress of Spanish film:) Moreover, great view from the window( I was staying on the 6 floor) will give you the opportunity to feel like the bird, which doesn't miss anything, because I was staying in the centre of the city and the main sightseeings are located here:) Despite being the guest in the new place, here I feel more as a citizen,not a tourist from Poland, because i have all necessary stuff at the kitchen, including microwave, fridge, coffee maker and etc. It is also pleasant that the room, bathroom and kitchen are very clean.

Especially traveling from place to place, I really appreciated a nice bed to sink into, with fresh, clean sheets. I was comfortable and at home. The staff/host are beyond helpful, and even personally showed me around the city a little bit! You can tell they treat the B&B and their guests with a lot of care.

We paid for a private room, it was a very expensive shell of a room. Very basic, nothing to write home about. Amenities, basic. Doing laundry was a chore. For a 800 person hostel, only 2 washing machines and 2 driers? Makes zero sense.Food and drink quality at the bar was average at best. Ordered a caprese salad and the cheese was clearly cut from a generic, cheap block of tasteless cheese. Was more plastic tasting than proper cheese.Both nights of our stay, we had kids running up and down the corridor long into the night and early morning, banging on our door etc. Needless to say, we didn’t get much sleep.We went to reception twice to ask questions / complain about noise. The first time, the woman who was there didn’t even bother looking up from her computer screen. The next time, the guy looked not bothered and shrugged his shoulders.The ONLY highlight of this place is the rooftop where you can see Sagrada Familia above the skyline.Wouldn’t recommend staying here, wouldn’t stay at a Generator again.

No shower plate in the en-suite bathroom, which was pretty messy and uncomfortable. In all fairness, there were other showers in the hallway bathrooms that seemed a bit better, but I didn't use them.

The good price and the generally relaxed vibe seemed to attract interesting people. The place was very clean for being a hostel with a lot of guests in the room, and there was an amazing roof top one could hang out at. This didn't bother me, but perhaps it's good to know that people were out partying and getting in very late (around 8 am) and then check out was at 10am, so if you're a light sleeper in need of beauty sleep perhaps the dorms isn't the best option.","December 18, 2018","17    Generator Barcelona

996,"In many ways this was the nicest hostel accommodation I have visited in a long time, even better than some hotels I’ve been to.Immediately when you arrive you get an upmarket feel, the lobby is nicely decorated and you feel more like you are in a hotel really. The staff all spoke fluent English which was helpful as well. This continues in the bedrooms. Each bed had an individual light and power socket and there were plenty of pillows stored in the drawers. The shower, toilet and sink were all separate which was incredibly useful because if someone was in the shower and another guest needed the toilet, that was available.Everything was spotlessly clean and freshly decorated. One minor fault here was that the plug in the sink did let the water out slowly so I had to keep the tap running all the time.Now onto the reasons why after such a good review I’m not giving 5 stars.First was breakfast, when you check in you are given a wrist band which is essentially a voucher for breakfast. In the morning I went down and saw what looked like a beautiful buffet breakfast in the the dining area and I thought this really tops off this place. I showed the waitress my wristband and I was pointed to another room with a closed door where she said I would find the breakfast for groups and that the buffet was an extra 8 euro. I followed her instructions only to find a breakfast offering half the selection so when you see the difference obviously you are going to pay the extra €8. I just thought it was a bit of a sales tactic doing this.Secondly, Barcelona is the pickpocket capital of Europe but you had to pay for lockers to store your valuables such as passport etc. I think Generator could do their bit to ensure guests safety by providing these for a refundable deposit.I probably won’t be returning but this is NOT the fault of the Generator because it really is excellent quality hostel accommodation. There is just so much stealing in the city I didn’t feel safe there at any time of day and I can’t say that about many other cities I’ve been to. Two of our group of 16 were victims of pickpockets in as many days. I will definitely stay in another Generator hostel, just not in Barcelona.","October 7, 2018","17    Generator Barcelona

I did not like that there was no food allowed in the hostel, no events coordinated with the hostel that were free, the roof top closed at 10pm, everything thing you had to pay for (especially overly priced as well) Very ridiculous. The whole point of a hostel, is to meet other travels and have fun but generator took all that out of it. My friends and I barely got to meet other travels and because of all the stricter-demanding rules is was frustrating and hard to have a enjoyable time. I hope the charges of the towels would go down to 1 euro instead of 5 euros. In my 8 bed room, one of the soap did not even have soap. On the 3rd floor, containing the 8 bed rooms, the shared shower, 2/3 were broken. All this hostel did was suck travelers money dry. My friends and I are very upset with our many nights here. All the shared from the 8 bed room to 6 bed room to shared shower were all so cramped. My friends and I DO NOT and WILL NOT be recommending this hostel to anyone ever!P.S.

1005,"We stayed in the Generator Barcelona as the base for our first trip to Barcelona.Where this review references our accommodation it only extends to the Penthouse - as for the other accommodation options in the hostel (and there are a few) I can’t comment.As we were travelling as a family group (3 adult and 1 child) we needed extra space beyond what a hotel room generally offers and discovered that the Penthouse (room 801) had separate king-size and queen-size beds - perfect.The Penthouse is essentially a self-contained apartment with bathroom / rainwater shower / kitchen / dining area / lounge and two bedrooms.Almost the entire space opens out onto a spacious dual-aspect terrace with good views across the city.All the expected appliances are installed - large TV (although only Spanish channels...not a complaint, just an observation) / fridge / cooking hob etc. Staying with the kitchen space, you get a 2-ring electric hob only - no oven or microwave. Hardly a show-stopper but this is a review...Cutlery (basic table knives, forks and spoons) is provided along with plates, bowls, glasses etc.One thing worth pointing out is that when we arrived the fridge was stocked with beers, a bottle each of white wine and cava, several soda waters and cola etc. A very welcoming touch, thank you.Lounge has two large sofas (one of which converts to a bed) although we spent most of the time outside on the terrace.The 3-zone aircon did a great job of keeping the space cool and the free WiFi worked pretty flawlessly for us.The space has lots of sliding partitions to provide privacy (not soundproof) but it’s worth knowing that none of the sliding doors have locks - if your life could be ruined by someone inadvertently walking in on you in the shower you might feel a little uncomfortable. For us it wasn’t an issue - a bit of a system and “announcements” cut the risk.There’s a sound system installed with speakers throughout the lounge area into which you can connect your phone / pod.The hostel itself is pretty vibrant with lots of people / nationalities coming and going..Bar & restaurant are off the main reception and are generally busy. At the other side of the reception space is a chill-out space (and an ATM) with a games room.Notable mention to the staff we encountered - all friendly, helpful and interested in sorting issues. A credit to the hostel.All in all we had a great stay at Generator and we would love to return.","August 20, 2018","17    Generator Barcelona

1008,"What a wonderful hotel. We had some (self-inflicted) problems after we booked, and although they shouldn't have, the staff were amazing moving our dates for us. We honestly thought we'd have to cancel - I could have hugged them!Great location off the Rambla. The room itself was wonderful - I really recommend the rooms with the bath on the balcony. It was heaven. Absolutely my only criticism is that there is no corkscrew in the room, so we had to borrow one from the bar (I know - it's not much of a criticism really is it?!)Some of the best restaurants I have ever eaten in were just down the road - Disfrutar was the most astounding experience, and I honestly can't recommend it highly enough. If you love food - make sure you go. I'd go to Barcelona just to eat here again!Loved Barcelona - what a great city to visit.

1009,"My wife and I stayed here for the last two nights. We found the hotel exceeded our expectations on a number of levels. I will list a few of the positive elements of our stay:1. Staff was very helpful, both during check in and throughout our stay. We arrived fairly early in the day and our room was not yet ready, but they were very concerned about our situation and called us as soon as our room was available.2. We are diamond members and received a wonderful upgraded room. The room was both classic in design, but also had a well-appointed modern bathroom with an excellent shower.3. Breakfast was very nice and included both Spanish and American options for those who might want either—leaning toward the Spanish, which is how it should be. The staff in the dining room was very helpful and attentive.4. The room had both a pod-style coffee maker as well as instant coffee and a hot water kettle. We used the pods in the afternoon of the first day and they brought new ones for us for the morning when we were out to dinner.5. We loved the neighborhood. It is just half a block each way to great shopping and restaurant streets. Very lively nightlife, but also not loud where the hotel is situated—kind of the best of both worlds.We had made a reservation at another hotel two days later, but decided to cancel that reservation and stay at the Alexandra instead of move. We had a wonderful few days at the hotel and would definitely return. Highly recommended!","July 9, 2019","18    Alexandra Barcelona Hotel, Curio Collection by...

1010,"OverallWe felt very welcome in this Hotel and I am glad we choose it!One of the guests had a birthday during our stay and we got a complimentary champagne bottle, thank you!We liked the hotel, because it is not that big overall and can only host a limited number of guests at a time. This somewhat gives you a bit of a more personalized approach by the staff, for example one of the wonderful staff members remembered that I prefer short style espresso coffee, instead of instant or American type, and offered me such on the consecutive days without me even asking!We checked in and out in no time, and on the last day of our stay we managed to walk around all day with our luggage safely stored at the hotel, so we do not have to carry it around until flight time!Location and transportThe location is simply perfect, we got from the BCN El Prat Airport to the hotel in literally 20 minutes time.When you look at this part of the town from the sky, it looks like perfect squares, amazing place and atmosphere!You could book a limousine or premium van chauffeur with meet and greet, who will wait for you even if there is a fight delay, can help you with luggage for about 40 - 180 euro (single or round trip), depending on the limousine type. The hotel can also offer airport or port transfer, but I have not made an inquiry about the price. There are also limousine tours with a guide who drives you around and tells you all about the city. We choose to walk instead, clocking an average of 25000 - 30000 steps per day and the cool thing was we were never more than 1 - 2 hours of walking distance from the hotel! Alternatively one can reach the hotel via public transport (3 Euro per person I think), regular taxi (about 30 Euro) or a line called Aerobus which we used about 6 euro per person for single trip. The other cool thing about the location is that is is situated next to a lot of interesting places you can see, be it historical landmarks, architecture marvels, museums, specialty cafes, craft beer bars, food places, sightseeing, etc.We used the Hilton Honors app and choose what the local Hilton guide Andre had recommended on a few occasions and we were not disappointed!HotelThe carpeting in the corridor is very soft and plush like and makes you feel like you are walking on clouds. The elevators have blue tinted see-thru glass doors! Overall the hotel is very posh.FoodThe Hotel itself has few different restaurants to choose from, how cool is that!The food is top quality all the way! If you do not have a prepaid BB package, the added price for a full continental breakfast is 20 euro per person.RoomThe AC is a brilliant unit by Japanese company Daikin, I think is it a chiller type unit, because it is virtually silent and very efficient. You can turn your room into an ice cave if you want! It is not centrally controlled by the Hotel, but by you!We had the ""Twin Collection"" room 508 and it was gorgeous! Initially I though we are on the upper most floor, but there appeared to be a total of 7 floors, but 2 are somehow hidden and accessible only via a key card.Inside the room there was a marvelous wooden parquet and the bathroom was finished in a very nice anti-slip way.The bathroom amenities are high class and it overall is very cozy!The beds and pillows are nice, comfy and are not fixed to the floor.I am very tall but the shower had plenty of headroom and the bed was long enough.We had a smart TV by Samsung, but it was not connected to a network, so that Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime, HBO Go and such can be used, but there are a ton of programs on the local channel list - we liked NHK Japan. Btw the Smart TV set does not have any physical buttons itself (like an on off switch) and is only controlled via the remote. One evening it somehow got stuck on one menu, (due to a software glitch I would presume - i.e. me pressing to many keys on the remote at the same time). Special thanks to the reception staff member who was kind enough to help us our ""restart"" the TV set by plugging it on and off, because it is wall mounted and I was afraid to touch it by myself.Also if you have a laptop and an HDMI cable - you can plug it in and cast something to the TV or you can use a flash drive with movies or series to watch while you chill in the hotel. There is also a small radio clock with BlueTooth and 3.5 mm audio aux jack, where you can listen to tunes from your phone, tablet or laptop.We got an amazing artwork on the wall!The sound insulation on the windows is absolutely next level, the room was perfectly silent when you close the window down!GymThe gym is small, has a total of 3 cardio machines - one elliptical, one treadmill and one stationary bicycle and a set of (light) dumbbells, but you can can a decent workout there with slow and exaggerated movements and lots of time under tension. The feeling is ballistic - the this is the first time I lifted in such an atmosphere (ps check out the floor!).Special thanks to the staff member who helped me get in the gym 5 minutes before its official opening time, and despite the fact that my key card wouldn't work to unlock it (i had forgotten to ask for an extra Gym card).There is also a small sauna there and a massage room.Patio and poolThis is among the best features IMO, I had a few beers on the Patio and received a wet towel to cool myself down even further alongside the brews, such a nice threat from the cool and friendly bartender! It really feels like a hidden gem in the heart of the city!All the staff were very nice, you can ask them for interesting restaurants and other recommendations and they are very happy to assist!","July 8, 2019","18    Alexandra Barcelona Hotel, Curio Collection by...

1012,"I paid for a ""collection"" type room that would have a ""view"" and received a room with the ""view of a column"" behind an extremely small window. The room was very dark that we could not see our clothes and there were no lights on the ceiling so it was even harder. The decor is also vey dark, so you can imagine how uncomfortable it was. Then to make matters worse, on our 2nd night the AC broke down in the entire building. It was summer in Barcelona, therefore we could not sleep and my kids who were in the room next to us could not either. I spent most of the night fanning my kids to sleep. So uncomfortable! The worse experience I have ever had at any hotel. In fact, I heard the staff complaining at the problem and the maintenance people saying that they should have gotten use to this problem as it always happened in summer. WOW!!! Do NOT stay here you are better off in so many other hotels in the area.","July 2, 2019","18    Alexandra Barcelona Hotel, Curio Collection by...

1016,"We are big Hilton fans and were excited to book a couple of rooms (and use some points) for five nights in Barcelona. The Alexandra was perfectly located for us. We were able to walk everywhere except for Park Guell and Camp Nou. The hotel staff were uniformly friendly and helpful. (Front desk staff member Ignasi was particularly service oriented and acted like a personal concierge.) The breakfasts were great...lots of variety and fresh. Some of the best oranges we've ever eaten! We used the business computers to book reservations and print tickets. We also took advantage of the fitness room, but it was sorely lacking in terms of space and machines. The dark (black) hallways were a bit eerie, but opened up in to well appointed rooms. We'd stay there again.","June 19, 2019","18    Alexandra Barcelona Hotel, Curio Collection by...

1017,"The reviews for this hotel are all over the place and there is a reason for that. Our stay was pretty terrible but had good moments. Everything from the rooms to the service seem to run the gamut. The real question is at this price, is it worth the risk? As for our stay, where to begin? As Hilton Gold members, my wife and I have been pleased with all of our Hilton stays up until the Alexandra in Barcelona. When we got there on our first day, we were offered an “upgraded” room which was supposed to be a king bed from a queen. Excited we headed to our room to discover two twin beds pushed together. It looked like two cots or a pull out couch. The room was dark with a tiny window and completely bare walls. It looked like it was halfway through construction with floors that were dirty and unfinished. We went back to the concierge, as we thought there was a mistake with the bed, and they were condescending and rude. They tried to convince us that the bed was a nice king but finally agreed to move us back to our original room which had nice normal bed and a good view but still looked as though it was under construction. The floor was not finished, the walls were bare, and the bathroom floor dirty. Also, it seems like the 5th floor is the floor not to be on. It is ascetically different from the other floors and was the only floor that did not require a key for access in the elevator like all the other floors. The floors in the hallway looked like they had not been vacuumed in weeks and the walls are paper thin. Also, while in Barcelona we had a mess up with our reservation at the famous Tickets restaurant that we made two months in advance. We talked to someone at the concierge who said they would call the restaurant on our behalf and sort it out. They said they would touch base with us later that day or email us. They never followed up, called, or got back to us (we ended up going to the restaurant in person and the got it sorted out ourselves - ps. Tickets was amazing). It seemed every interaction we had with the front desk was either a lie, met with a rude response, or a different answer from someone else. We asked for a late check out: one person said the hotel was sold out the next day and could not accommodate (which was not true after a basic google search), another person later the day said you have to come down in the morning at checkout time and request an extension at that time, finally we got someone who just said no problem and gave us an hour late checkout no issue. Then, even when we went to check out, we stood waiting for a while in line and when I finally asked the woman at the front desk who was ignoring us she said “you’re already checked out” without offering the final receipt or asking our room number. Confused, I had to ask if she wanted to room keys back! She didn’t ask, how was your stay? Or say thank you. Would not recommend. The reviews on here are all over the place for a reason. 50% of the time is was fine and 50% of the time it was pretty bad service and dirty. Not worth the price at all!","June 19, 2019","18    Alexandra Barcelona Hotel, Curio Collection by...

1019,"Firstly, as most reviews have noted, the location in Barcelona is great. All of the staff was very professional and nice throughout our stay. The bar on the first floor was a great place to hang out. Our overall rating would have been higher but we experienced a few issues:Physical plant: The elevator accessing our room on the 8th floor was broken on 2 out 3 days. My wife got stuck in the elevator on one of these days. We had to use the other elevator and walk up to the 8th floor several times. In addition, the hallway carpets on the 8th floor were not always the cleanest. Service inefficiency: We experienced a couple of annoying issues (keys were not programmed properly for 2 out of our three rooms; HiltonHonor points were incorrect since it appears the folios were uploaded incorrectly. The hotel indicates it was Hilton; the HiltonHonors customer rep says it was the hotel). Management is aware and apologized, so I hope these issues are addressed to benefit future guests.

Loved the unique calming black hallways, the combination of historic features (cool ceiling medallion and awesome tile floors) and modern décor in the guest room. The bathroom was cool with the high-tech shower which was a welcome feature after long days of touring on foot. Despite the street exposure, the room was quiet and restful.

1035,"We stayed here for three nights before getting on a cruise, and I selected the Alexandra for location and price. We arrived pretty late after traveling for 22 hours and were greeted warmly and quickly - up in our room inside of ten minutes. The staff during our entire stay was truly nice and top notch.We booked a king room, which for *European standards*, was pretty spacious with a nice large bathroom. The room was clean, comfortable and sleep quality great. I run pretty hot, so I was pleasantly surprised that I could cool down the room adequately given many hotels govern the HVAC systems during different seasons. The location was fantastic and we could walk to almost anywhere that we were not getting to via a Hop On/Off Bus pass we had for two days. There were tons of restaurants, shopping and coffee shops within half a mile of the hotel, many of the big sites to see in Barcelona were within an easy 1.5 mile walking radius. We had breakfast one morning in the restaurant which was buffet style and quite good. Another evening we had dinner in their restaurant Solomillo which was excellent.The only two negatives were -- housekeeping did not refresh in the in-room coffee each day (I hate that) and the shower was kind of weird with the shower head coming from the wall not working, so you had to remove this side shower head to rinse off and shower.","May 19, 2019","18    Alexandra Barcelona Hotel, Curio Collection by...

Walking distance to many top tourist attractions and ideally located near dozens of great restaurants and bars.

Additionally, they have great amenities, friendly staff, onsite parking if needed, and their nightly rate is great, compared to most other QUALITY hotels in the area.

The patio and pool area is very quaint and has a nice vibe. However the King Suite room was very plain and small. Walls were empty and bland. Some Barcelonian art or pictures would add a nice vibe to the room. The walls are paper thin - you can hear everything on the adjacent rooms.

1061,"We stayed here for two nights in a pre-paid King Deluxe room because their website says it's a ""larger"" room.Upon checking in they gave us a tiny King Superior room that was so small there wasn't any room to pass each other. We asked for another room only to be told they were sold out....After complaining about the "" bait & switch"" we felt had happened they miraculously found the room type I had paid for. Not a best practice but many hotels do it - so beware not only here but at all places that offer a pre-paid rate. You pay for the ""larger"" room upfront and they give you a tiny shoebox - hoping you don't notice. Our room had the strangest layout of any we've ever stayed in. Crazy bathroom and shower combination and the mosaic tile floors looked dirty - our feet confirmed that every night getting in bed.As for the general feel of the hotel, it's dated - really outdated.The lobby furniture is from the 60's mod era. the sofas are so low to the ground anyone over 50 will have to roll onto the ground to get up, and then only with assistance ! LOL The hallways are dark brown/black - floor to ceiling all black with black carpeting and low lighting - felt more like a fetish club than a major hotel chain. The area is noisier than staying on Las Ramblas - very busy streets day & night and with the hotel not having air conditioning at this time of year, we had to open the windows just to moderate the temperature but it came at the cost of noise.After a long day of sight seeing, we came back to the hotel without elevator service because they were using both of them to unload furniture...I agree the furniture needs replacing, but not if that forces the customers to walk up flights of stairs, it was poor judgement.Probably one of the worse Hilton branded properties we have stayed in.Note to self.... go back to Le Meridien, Hotel H1898 or The Royal all on Las Rambas. you'll be happier !","March 2, 2019","18    Alexandra Barcelona Hotel, Curio Collection by...

The little walk was literally around the back of the main hotel entrance and was secured by a door and entrance buzzer. When we got to the room, we were really pleased with it (room 008). It was a suite with bedroom, living area (with double sofa bed), kitchen area, spotless bathroom (with free goodies) and a balcony/terrace area. Two large telly's in both rooms (we hardly used it) and wardrobe in the main bedroom. Room/hotel was very very quiet with the Clot metro station literally outside which provided easy access to the attractions. Room was cleaned every day and free bottles of water and apples were left.

The style of the hotel is very modern and a good place to stay for young couples, the room was really clean with comfy beds and a nice bathroom, the windows give you a good view of other buildings around.

1075,"This hotel is in a good location, not far from the Clot metro station and some attractions, shopping and many cafes. It has the best shower we have ever experienced, but one of the worst WiFi connection-- uneven and slow (less than 0.5 mB/sec at times), with a very weak signal. The rooms are small but well equipped, however, they have the most peculiar ""decoration"" in the form of a window between the bathroom and the room. Forget about privacy in the bathroom, or visiting the bathroom at night-- you'll wake up your room-mate if you turned on the light there.They have neither a restaurant nor a bar, but serve breakfast (for extra charge). We asked for a second blanket and took several requests until we actually got one, hours later. The AC is noisy and its thermostat seems not to function at all. In short-- very expensive for what you get.","February 1, 2019","19    Leonardo Boutique Hotel Barcelona Sagrada Familia

Long wait at breakfast for lift. There is only one!Room not cleaned by 3pm on day two - this is too late if you want to rest. THis needs to be reviewed.Area is Clot - not Sagrada Familia. Don't be fooled by name.Street can be noisy.We would return if we needed too. That said, we would likely find somewhere else which must be an indication that we were not 'wowed' by this hotel.If you have booked here, you should be fine.

1081,"We Did not book the hotel as it was part of our trip, organised by the travel company. It was about a 25min drive from the airport and about 40 euros - there was a tube station very nearby but with our luggage we decided to take a taxi. The Reception area was lovely and clean -with lemon infused water and apples on the counter.The staff were friendly and their English was very good. We were told we had been upgraded to a larger room (although I do wonder if they were overbooked) This meant that we had to go outside, round the block and ring the bell which was answered remotely by the reception staff at the main hotel. The lobby was impersonal and smelt of cigarettes. Our Key card did not work and my husband had to ring the bell again to contact reception. Initially, we were asked to collect another card key - but the male receptionist quickly overode that and said he would bring it round. To be honest, I was glad not to be left outside our room door as the area was a little bit scary late at night..Once inside, the room and shower room were great - and we were very surprised to see a two ring hob, a microwave, fridge as well as utensils, saucepans, plates etc. There was also a medium sized bottle of water and 2 large apples.The bed was big and comfy and in the morning, we were able to walk across a roof terrace to breakfast in the main building (this was only open at breakfast time) The meal was 10euros each - a buffet - but a good choice was available.We were able to leave our luggage locked behind the reception area until we needed to leave for our cruise - and were directed to the terrace/library or solarium. The library had wonderful wallpaper looking like bookshelves and just a very few books but the plus side was that there was a loo there as there was not one in reception. The terrace was peaceful with a great view over Barcelona - Hubby went exploring and came back to get me as the solarium was actually a sun terrace with loungers. I spent a wonderful 15 mins enjoying the sun,We went back to reception and they called a taxi to take us on the 20 min trip to the port -about 35 euros. If we return to Barcelona, I would definitely use this hotel again but would probably ask to stay in the main building.","October 26, 2018","19    Leonardo Boutique Hotel Barcelona Sagrada Familia

1082,"This hotel is very conveniently located within a 5-6 minute walk to the “Clot” Metro subway station in a very safe comfortable neighborhood. The hotel has been recently remodeled. Rooms are a bit small by American standards but adequate. The breakfast came with our rooms and offered a great assortment of beverages, breads, meats (cold and hot) , fruits, bake goods and juices. You will not go away hungry. The Metro provide very economical, safe, quick transportation. Purchase the 10 –ride pass at its only $1.05 euros per ride.Do not buy ham or sausages to bring back to the USA. The vendors will tell you ""no problems"" but if you declare it at customs they will confiscate meats. Note that Parc Guell and Sagrada Familia both issue time sensitive tickets, giving you a 30 minutes window to enter. We went and tickets were sold out for the day at Park Guell and for the next four days to Sagrada Familia. We were able to purchase a ticket on line for both venues from a ticketing agency for the 50% premium.The hotel may be rated 3 stars by amenities but we received 5 star service.

1090,"Stayed here as an unexpected extension to our holiday in Barcelona (emergency case including a hospital visit). Choose the hotel last minute over the price and the relative proximity to our previous hotel. The hotel itself is new and modern, in a residential neighbourhood with many small shops and restaurants in an immediate vicinity.Location: Slightly outside the central zone, in probably 20 min walk to Sagrada Familia (it is located in the same street, but the streets in Barcelona are very long). Metro stop of two lines in 2min walk, so you can easily reach the central part of the city.Room: Stayed in a comfort room that looked exactly as hotel's web site. Decent size room with big flat TV, AC, small table. Small wardrobe, so not many space to hang your clothes. No mini bar (the fridge is empty), but you get tea/coffee set as an compliment. All rooms facing the street, so nice views over the city. Nice bathroom with great shower.Service/amenities: The hotel itself is not big and there is no place to hang around apart in your room. It is 9-storey building with sun terrace on the last floor. There are small ""library"" (which was used as a luggage storage room for a big group) and TV room with vending machines for those needing a refreshment late. Both rooms with no natural light.The hotel's lobby is small, with only a small sofa, that it looks more like an waiting room than a lobby of a 3* boutique hotel.We did not take the breakfast (so I can't comment on it), but saw there is nice terrace adjoining the breakdast room where you can sit in the mornings.Do not get me wrong, the hotel is nice, new and modern. In a city like Barcelona probably you won't be staying much in your hotel for more than sleeping. But I personally would prefer to have a little more space where you can sit and do not feel like you are bothering the reception's personnel.Will I stay here again? For the right price and if there is nothing more central, probably yes. Otherwise I would look for an alternative.Note to reception's and hotel management: do not forget that hotel guests may understand what you are talking about even if they are not from spanish speaking country. I may prefer to speak in english, but that doesn't mean I can't speak and uderstand spanish perfectly fine.","June 30, 2018","19    Leonardo Boutique Hotel Barcelona Sagrada Familia

The room and ensuite we had was GREAT. It had all we wanted. It was clean, modern, comfortable and just the right size. The location is very good with a metro and a standard railway line both in close proximity to the hotel. The Sagrada Famiglia is about a 20 minute walk away or a quick few minutes on the metro. There are also buses and a tram close by. The tapas we had in the neighbourhood and a homely restaurant we went to close by to the hotel were fantastic with flavoursome food. We had the best chat with the shoe shop man where I bought a pair of sandals. There was a small market on one of the days; and the local cafes, serving jamon rolls are fantastic.

1106,"The hotel is nice form the design point of view, the problem at the check in was that we had to wait for 2 hours before entering in the room that was anyway not ready yet.The receptionist (a very professional guy) tried to push the room service to end the cleaning job asap.Breakfast is nice but nothing special.Rooms are ok, clean and not noisyWhat we didn't like is the behavior of the other receptionist (a girl) that even didn't say hello to us while entering in the hotel, she just stared us and ignored me while I was waiting for her to ask an information, she was not smiling at all and answered in a very cold way (just the opposite of the receptionist man that was very gentle).If you need just a place for sleeping and nothing more then this hotel is ok, becasue is 10 minutes far from sagrada familia.Maybe price is a little too high for the service they propose.","August 9, 2017","19    Leonardo Boutique Hotel Barcelona Sagrada Familia

1107,"Good hotel for a short stay in Barce. We had an issue checking in, we paid upfront for the room when we booked so the room was already paid for. When we checked in the 2 slightly rude girls on the desk said we needed the card we used to pay for security reasons to prove who we were despite having other cards in the same name & our passports this wasn't good enough for them. They said we couldn't check in without it so we had to leave our bags with them while we went into the city & waited for a relative back home to take a photo of the card and send it to us. This meant we couldn't use our room to freshen up after a long day of traveling. This was sorted later that day but some basic common sense from the hotel staff would have fixed this. Very stupid.Location is a little way outside of the city but good public transport links solve this problem. We got the train from the airport to Clot main-line station which is only a 5 min walk away. Also Clot has a metro stop with an entrance just meters from the hotel.The rooms are basic but nice for what you pay. Shops in the area for food and drink if you need any in your room. Bed was comfy & the was pretty quiet at night, our room faced the main street.","July 26, 2017","19    Leonardo Boutique Hotel Barcelona Sagrada Familia

They offer fresh fruit water in the lobby daily and free big bottles of water in the room daily as well. The rooms are spacious and very clean. Air conditioning works very well. The breakfast is also very good, a lot of options and delicious. The location is great a short walk to the Sagrada Familia and literally 3 minute walk to the metro which takes you into the city area. The staff is very friendly and always there to help and answer any questions. I would definitely recommend staying here and will stay here again if I visit again.

1115,"Our 'Park Guell Cozy Apartment' AirBnB host Patricia let us down badly (cancelled with less than 48 hours' notice), and we found this lovely hotel in another part of Barcelona which turned out to be a gem. El Clot - Agora is on the train line from Girona where we began our trip and adjoins the Metro line, great for getting to Urquinaona (Paula del la Musica Catalana) and to San Andrea - a real village atmosphere.The staff were extremely helpful and friendly, the room (although not large - it is a boutique hotel after all) was clean, comfortable and quiet.

Located walking distance to Sagrada Familia, major brand shopping street. The restaurantes and cafes close by were very reasonablly priced and delicious. Recommend to go La Musclira for seafood dinner right next door. But the bathroom smelled very bad. I am assuming coming from old drainage pipes. They could have used fresher bath towels.

1117,"We stayed for 3 nights in May in the Economy Triple Budget room. There was nothing Triple about it. The double rooms next door were the same size. Ours only had an extra bed. Even the double room is really tiny. And expensive at 100 euros a day.There is no table in the room to keep your things. Near the bed there is a small shelf 6 cm x 4 cm. Enough space to keep a smartphone. Ridiculous. Nothing else can be placed on the table. We actually had to keep our glasses, keys, watch on top of our bags.No kettle in the rooms. So you can forget hot water for tea coffee. And the coffee machine and water machine in the lobby did not work for the entire 4 days we were there. I complained about this on the 2nd day and the reception arranged a kettle for me.The location is good yes. But I really cannot recommend this hostal to families. For singles/ backpackers maybe yes. But again at €100 a night it is just too expensive and for a room which does not even have a table!I've done a lot of reviews on Tripadvisor if you see my profile, and I've mostly given 4 or 5 star ratings to even 1-star hotels because of the value they give. But Martinval has to get 1-star rating only. The rooms are just ridiculously tiny. They need to drop the price by 40% to come to fair value.","May 24, 2019","20    Hostal Martinval

1118,"I can confirm the validity of the previous reviews, this place is a great little find! Excellent location & their customer service is what would be expected from a 4* hotel which is really what elevates this from wanting to call it a ""hostel"". Rooms are cleaned each day providing you hang your tag outside and expect a refreshment of shower gels and lotions along with a chocolate/sweet on your pillow. The guys on the front desk (24 hours a day) are always on hand and more than happy to help.We opted for an economy double room with its own private bathroom, the room was modern and clean with all the amenities you would expect in a standard hotel room. The only thing I would have liked is to know before hand if my room had a balcony, didnt expect it given it was an economy room but maybe something the listings on the booking websites could include as sitting outside in balmy weather with a glass of wine really would have been the cherry on an already great cake.What you really need to know if you are looking to stop here is that at the heart of it this is still a hostel. Our room was opposite the shared bathroom and while those on our floor were polite enough to shower from 7am am the same couldn't be said to anyone else staying on a different day and so earplugs may be required. While it may have only been in our room we did find the temperature of the shower struggled to get past warm, not a particular issue for us but if you need a scalding hot shower each morning this may be something to consider.Over all I imagine you could pay 3x as much to stop at a sub par hotel with a mediocre breakfast included, instead you should pass on that and book a room here then get yourself up and explore the neighbourhood which is full off fantastic restaurants, coffee shops and bodegas along with being 15 minutes from la sagrada familia. When we come back to Barcelona we will be booking here again (but making sure we opt for a room with a balcony next time!), muchas gracias Hostal Martinval.","February 22, 2019","20    Hostal Martinval

There are a number of supermarkets, restaurants and bars nearby and location wise it is smack bang in the middle of everything with a 15 minute (ish) walk to the square and la Rambla.

I would have expected a little more comfortable beds for the price. Also the couple times we were out late we got yelled at by security even though we were not being loud. It's as if they did not want people to go out at night at all. They were very rude following us to our rooms. The location was pretty good.

1135,"Upon checking in, we were immediately given tips on where to go to eat, to shop and sight see by the member of staff at reception. The staff in general were very helpful and lent us an iron and an adapter plug when we needed one. They also have a safe to store important items such as passports in.The location of the hostal was perfect as we were around 10 minutes walk from Sagrada Familia and Passeig De Gracia which was super convenient. If you're worrying about food then that's not an issue as there's a SPAR right next door to the place where you can buy fresh watermelon, water and cakes for super cheap. I recommend going to NOSTRUM which is on the same road for breakfast/lunch as it's super cheap and tastes great. There's also an ice cream parlour directly opposite the hostal which is always a plus.The only issue that we did have however was the noise. Particularly if your room is facing the street you'll find that you can practically hear everything and anything such as litter trucks to pedestrians speaking loudly. Because of this I only recall sleeping well only once, which was a shame. The fact that we had noisy neighbours didn't help.

The reception was open 24/7 which was a huge advantage. We had a room with a bathroom which was great. But the bathroom's floor was not profiled properly and everytime we took a shower the whole bathroom's floor got flooded. Our room had two windows but when we opened them we found out that there are shafts there so there was no daylight reaching our room whatsoever. We spent the whole days outside but it is nice to see bright sun in the morning especially in a place like Barcelona. There was a smell, I think it was coming from the bathroom or from these shafts and you could hear people in other rooms or apartments using toilet because of these shafts behind the window.

1145,"""Flat screen TV in every room"" sounded great .. till we found out that not one of the over 50 channels was in English. ""Triple room with a bathroom"" - didn't mention that we had to share it with some Asians who flooded the place every time they used it. I am a positive person generally but many things here left me disappointed. The bedside lights don't work. We reported it and were told that they knew about it but could not do anything about it. So no reading in bed, and the overhead light was too weak to read by. They couldn't exchange the double bed in the room for two singles, so two men had to share a bed. There was a SMALL hanging closet and only 4 hangers ...for three people. No facility to warm up any food. I'm sorry but when all that's added up, that's not good customer service. .The manager, Emilia, was great though, very helpful and informative ... and good at apologizing. The location is good though, very central, and the daily servicing was excellent.","December 30, 2016","20    Hostal Martinval

Whilst my friend was going to the toilet in the shared bathroom at 2am(ish), the night receptionist came up and shouted into our room ""DOES SHE WANT TO SLEEP OUTSIDE?"".Apart from that, I thoroughly recommend this hotel.

Our double bedroom with private bathroom was smaller than we were expecting. Unfortunately we were put off by the dirty bathroom (a lot of hair in the bathtub strainer and sink). Also the water pressure was so low that it was really hard to wash hands.The room was reasonably quite (no street noise) although our room was attached to a dorm room (I suppose) and we got some noise in the middle of the night when the young guys were getting back drunk.However, this place is located in a very nice spot, it is few minutes walk to everything (Casa Batlo, Casa Mila, diagonal, subway stations, ...).

Granted, it's more for young back back travelers, but the apartment we stayed in QS perfect for us. No bathroom sharing, 3 bedrooms, living room, up to date kitchen. A grocery store right next door. Walking distance from many tourists and shopping locations. The only thing that didn't make me give it 5 stars was construction in a nearby building and because the building are so close to each other you could hear it during late hours of the night and early mornings. I realize it's beyond the hostal control, however it is something to take into account if you are a light sleeper.

Toilet and shower room are fine. Bed is not bad, Wifi is very good as opposed to some comments. We did nit have problems with the connections and it was fast.

The surroundings are reminiscent of Kensington or the Champ Elysee in the sun with fashionable stores and bars in close proximity all located along tree-lined avenues. Anna and Victor are the wonderful hosts and could not do enough to help! We arrived with 2 bikes and lots of luggage which they helped us to accommodate. They also cater for vegans. We arrived during the taxi strike and they advised us what our best options were. They also helpfully provided useful instruction on the local attractions and booked a taxi for our return journey. Most importantly they maintained a nice, calm and friendly atmosphere - especially during breakfast when Victor played his prize jazz record collection. Fresh fruit and meats and homemade bakes were accompanied by other choices making this a fine continental breakfast! And where could be better to eat it than on the expansive and calming terrace - carefully decorated with pot plants and flower baskets. Although the location does mean that there is some street noise - this adds and does not detract from the personality of the B and B. It makes you feel part of the living, breathing and exciting cityscape. Although fans are provided, there is no air conditioning and this does result the room feeling a little warm at times. Ventilation is adequate and high ceilings and the fans mean that this not a massive issue. If anything these (open shutters and ceiling fan) add to the period feel of the property. Additionally we travelled during a heat wave at the beginning of August and there would be no issue at all throughout the rest of the year. The room was very clean and spacious with comfortable futon style beds (double or twin options available) and a lovely en suite bathroom with a great shower.

1180,"La Casa Gran is small BnB run by the couple Anna and Victor. They are both extremely nice and calm, and are already on first name basis from the first moment - perhaps I was just a touch emotional after a long weekend hiking in the mountains, but for hosts to address guests by their first names it always a plus for me.The location of the BnB is fantastic, one is on average 20 to 30mins on foot to most places inside the city centre, 40mins at most if you go to the seaside. There are also two Metro stations nearby as well so you have plenty of options to get around. The place itself is a huge lofty apartment with 5 guest rooms, their office area, a breakfast area and a balcony where one could sit outside for breakfast and breaks. The couple also lives on the premise. It's a place full of character and personal touches, antique collections, old furnitures and an admirable collection of LPs.Breakfast every morning is with jazz from one the LPs (¡me encanta!), organic bread, delicious homemade juice, and the one that takes the prize: Anna's home made, no fuss, very delicious vegan biscuits and a blueberry cake with no added sugar. I am a fan of no fuss, home made bake goods without all the icing and dressing, and I have NEVER been to a BnB, where the host would home bake things for guests! I love that extra personal touch.The room I was in was very clean and comfortable. Interesting thing was having the shower/ bath tub almost next to the bed. I rather enjoyed that but I was there alone. There also a little sunroom with a table and two chairs, should you like to move around in the room a bit without feeling claustrophobic.The price might be slightly higher than some BnBs in Barcelona but not by that much, honestly, as Barcelona is an expensive city. For the price you pay here, you receive a lot more than at places of similar prices. And I would say I am a seasonal traveller, who have stayed in hostels, BnBs, no star to starred hotels.","July 23, 2018","21    La Casa Gran B&B

The room was very comfortable, clean and spacious and had large double windows that we could open and look out at the hustle & bustle of the city.

Finally I booked the other hotel on the April, 09 and I received the confirmation from the other hotel immediately. As I it was non-refundable rate the other hotel charged the money for the room on the next day, April, 10.More than in a month, at the end of May I received the email with confirmation from La Casa Gran Barcelona. At the same day I was charged non-refundable rate. I wrote to the hotel that it was a mistake and asked to refund the money charged. They declined to do that and now I try to return my money through my bank and payment service provider.","June 5, 2018","21    La Casa Gran B&B

There were gorgeous white plaster moldings and a little fireplace in our room.The owners were young and so very nice, calm, and natural, Anna and Victor. They were very helpful if you needed them but otherwise they left you to your own devices-it felt as if we lived there. The office was full of art books about Barcelona architects and artists.

I must say that we usually do not stay in B&B’s and our experience here will not change our minds. There is very loud traffic noise and the walls are paper thin. The breakfast has extended cold offerings and the fresh orange juice was delicious. There is a lovely patio for sunny days but you would still have the noisy traffic. The fact that there are earplugs provided tells you that noise is a problem. It’s a hike to the Gothic Quarter where you will probably spend most of your time. Also hike to subway.

It was our first time in Barcelona.The location was so convenient for walking to many of the sites - La Sagrada Familia, Las Rambles, Casa Milia. There were many restaurant and wine bars only a few steps away. The public bus stopped right outside the building making it easy to navigate the city. The Hop On Hope Off Bus stopped just around the corner. Our hosts, Anna & Victor, were delightful and so helpful to tell us the bus to take to different tourist destinations and make restaurant recommendations. There was a lovely outdoor patio to enjoy the beautiful weather while eating breakfast or having an end of the day glass of wine. The breakfast was wonderful with Anna's homemade baked goodies each morning! There was a small refrigerator for the use of the guests. A variety of teas were always available for your convenience. It was a charming place to stay with equally charming hosts. We will definitely stay there on our return to Barcelona in the future.P.S. There was some street noise - after all you're right in the city. It lulled me to sleep each night. If you are sensitive to noise, the hosts provide you with ear plugs in a cute little bag.","October 16, 2017","21    La Casa Gran B&B

The B&B is in an historical building in the Eixample District (on a major shopping avenue), central to several bus and metro lines and to plenty of great restaurants and shopping and good walking distance to other neighborhoods and sights in Barcelona. Victor and Anna are great hosts, have appointed the B&B beautifully and maintain it very well (modern comfortable style with lots of light and open spaces - and with great period pieces to accent and decorate), and know Barcelona very well and can guide you around to different things to do and restaurants to visit.

We were in walking distance to everything we needed...great coffee, great tapas, great people. Initially I was concerned that the building may be old and I would have climb quite a few stairs. Anna quickly assured me the building had an elevator. What she did not tell me was the elevator is absolutely gorgeous...like out of a period piece beautiful...swirly-wrought- iron-glass enclosed elegance.La Casa Gran is decorated with lovely artwork from around the world with a country chic feel. Our room was spacious with a balcony view of Ave. Diagonal and rain shower en suite bathroom. Breakfast was served daily in the tradition of Catalans...savory with some sweets while Miles Davis' Kinda Blue classic on vinyl filled the air.

The room I stayed in was perfect, a great size, the bed was super-comfy, big windows open up to the street, a Japanese-style deep soaking bathtub in the corner; a perfect spot for a mid-afternoon siesta after earlier adventures. Victor & Anna were the most welcoming hosts I have ever encountered. Their English is perfect, everything was made very easy, they had lots of great local tips, such as a one-of-a-kind ancient local bodega just around the corner where you can pick up Vermouths and wines straight from the barrel. Breakfast was excellent, with fresh, locally baked breads, awesome Catalan cheeses, home made treats and the option to dine on the sun soaked terrace.

Breakfast was relaxed and delicious (especially Anna's cakes and Victor's gazpacho ). We had room one which had three wonderful balconies overlooking the street allowing the light to flood the room. The room was spotless with extremely comfortable beds and lovely fresh white linen. There is some noise from the street ( I don't think Barcelona ever sleeps!!) but we put the ceiling fan on full and closed the windows at night so as not to be disturbed. Everything is easily accessible from the b & b. Tour buses and normal buses stop outside and Diagonal metro station is an easy 10 walk away (we took the metro to and from the airport with no problems at all - much nicer than London Underground).

1211,"Finding La Casa Gran trust your GPS. Although there is no large B&B sign out the front there is a small sign at the building entrance. The building is an apartment building and not obvious as a B&B. Easy to miss but once you are in the B&B all is well. Anna and Victor are wonderful hosts in a B&B that offers the complete package. We arrived by car,unloaded our large bags (travelling for over 5 weeks), travelled up the lift to the B&B and then Anna directed us where to park the car for 3 nights. You do not need a car in Barcelona. Anna and Victor have negotiated a rate at the car park about 2 blocks away which is extremely generous. Our room was large with a good bed, a bath in the room and toilet and vanity in a small functional room. The room as described by other reviewers is a mixture of old and new. The shutters do work quite well in shutting out the Barcelona noise but you are in a big city so you do get some noise so be prepared for that. The people in the room next to us from Labrador in Canada had ear plugs which they were happy with but I must say the only noise problem we had was a young couple in the next room arriving home late mistaking our door for theirs and then being a bit noisy. We are travellers so in bed early and they were night owls so in bed late. That can happen in any hotel or B&B so was just a minor issue. Both Anna and Victor spend a lot of time assisting with maps and guidance where to go, what to see and which restaurants to go to. They put us on to a delightful seafood restaurant in little Barcelona and recommended the restaurant over the road when we were very tired from the long drive to Barcelona.on our first night there. Breakfast was as other reviewers describe a mix of local produce combined with fresh baked offerings from Anna's kitchen. A nice room with plenty of light made it a very pleasant room to chat with Anna and Victor and fellow travellers. There is a communal fridge in the breakfast room if you need to store cold drinks etc. This B&B is delightful and by now is offering a little extra. When we were there Anna and Victor were developing a courtyard entertainment seating area on the back terrace. This will be a delightful place to spend time and perhaps have breakfast on lovely summer mornings. This is an excellent choice as a place to spend time in Barcelona. Maybe one day we might come back and get to enjoy the back terrace.Overall we have no hesitation in recommending this B&B. Writing this brings back happy memories of three lovely days spent with wonderful hosts who added something to our time in wonderful Barcelona and also added touring suggestions on our way to France. Anna suggested a slight detour to Dali's holiday place on the coast which ended up being another highlight. They also made good suggestions about prior bookings to ensure gaining admission to Gaudi's Park Guell and Familia Sagrada.","June 6, 2016","21    La Casa Gran B&B

She was so helpful, welcoming and efficient . She and Victor have lived in London, so their English is superb. The room was a very good size with high ceilings ,original shutters and balconies on both the bedroom and the bathroom. The walk in shower is fabulous with excellent water pressure, big fluffy towels and a very comfy bed. a great combination of original features and modern amenities. Free Wi-Fi. As others have commented the breakfast is delicious with all products sourced locally, with the addition of a lovely lemon cake made by Anna that day. She and Victor are excellent hosts and can't do enough to make your stay the best experience possible. There isn't a bar but you're welcome to bring in your own beers/wine etc. and store them in the dining room fridge. the local area felt very safe, with good access to buses and an extensive range of bars/cafes and restaurants nearby.

The hosts, Anna and Victor, have managed to put together a very homely B&B where one feels warmly welcomed from the very beginning. They are not only very good at what they do but also extremely caring and helpful (they gave me great tips for cultural activities, restaurants, bars and everything else I needed). The location is great (Example Esquerre) and, for what I've learnt, the building itself is a listed construction from the early 30s. The interior perfectly blends the traditional with contemporary and modern amenities. The rooms are spacious, confortable and superbly clean. Special mention to the breakfast they prepare every morning that includes a delicious orange juice, croissants, yoghurts, a wonderful selection of Spanish cold meat amongst many other things. All products were local and they explained me how their philosophy is based on environmental sustainability and the support to local businesses (a great plus for me)I regularly travel to Barcelona so La Casa Gran will undoubtedly be my first option.

1216,I stayed one night in this place. It is so beautifully decorated you feel you are living in a fancy flat in old times. Very clean. This is part of the place the owners live so they are always available and extremely helpful and nice. The lady in charge is called Monse and she is so classy and professional. Breakfast was plenty and good quality. It is in middle of diagonal where the shops and nice restaurants are.Yet it is not noisy.,"December 26, 2015","21    La Casa Gran B&B

Every day breakfast was different: the most expensive Jamon Iberico was always present and that was marvellous! Different cookies, cakes, tartas, etc., freshly squeezed orange juice… We did not want to leave the table because it was all so tasty, fresh, natural, and delicious. We are very grateful to Montse and the next time we come to Barcelona – we will definitely stay in the same hotel. Montse also gave us two guides: one to the most popular sightseeings in Barcelona, and another to the most recommended restaurants and bars locally. Should be noted the hotel is located in the center of Barcelona, so many attractions are just walking by foot. So far this is the best hotel with the warmest atmosphere we have ever stayed at.

I came home with renewed energy to re-think my house design...and a sense of being visually nourished by the experience in a deep way. we had one problem: we struggled a little bit with being on first floor above diagonal. one of us is very noise sensitive, and this meant that, as we are used to more quietness, it really took time to get used to the traffic noise. but a beautiful, memorable place, a sense of having been 'within' Barcelona instead of visiting on the 'outside' you would get from a large hotel. and a lovely hostess","March 30, 2015","21    La Casa Gran B&B

They are street facing but it's a quieter area but there is skateboard traffic at night. The only issue I had was on our last night the bar downstairs was open. I was on the first floor and I'm guessing directly above the kitchen. I could hear music but just turned on white noise on my phone. After bar closing it got much louder and woke me up. After 30 minutes I went to the lobby in my robe to ask the front desk if they could do something about it and the music immediately stopped.

1250,"Arrived early on a Sunday and did not expect to be checked in, but we had a friendly reception and our bags were held while we enjoyed Barcelona. When we did check in, we were upgraded to a corner room which since it was the corner of a mostly pedestrian street and a lane, was quiet. The room was very large with a very efficient heating and cooling system, a large sitting area with large sofa and very comfortable wing chairs and comfortable bed. There was a safe in the hallway, tuned to a classical station, which was nice. Also in the hallway was the toilet, all on its own with quite a few steps to the bathroom and the sink. The bathroom was again spacious with very good lighting and mirrors and - a great surprise when Europe tends to have a huge aversion to electricity in the bathroom -, two adjacent plugs for the hair dryer. There were no glasses, not even plastic. These had to be claimed from the buffet area in Reception but the good news there was there were snacks and cold drinks available free of charge round the clock. There was also an excellent shaded roof terrace area with a wonderful view and an honour bar, and a bottle of wine was a very reasonable 13 euros. In the morning, the shower turned out to be a wonderful rain-head affair, with also a hand-held and even a bidet nozzle. Tons of really hot water. Breakfast was the usual continental offering, marred by hard rock music. The staff, except for the supercilious night clerk, were wonderful, the bicycles hanging from the reception ceiling added to the feeling of something a bit different. It's expensive, and the immediate neighbouring restaurants are not up to much, but La Rambla is a short walk away. The final quirk was that the bathroom had no curtains except net and there was a building opposite, but I was able access the small balcony and lower a blind.","March 20, 2019","22    Casa Camper Hotel Barcelona

1251,"Casa Camper is a boutique hotel run by the Camper Shoe Company. It had modern European, eclectic decor. The rooms were spacious and the bed was one of the best we had in Europe. Loved the bath as well, as it had a large window looking out to a giant wall filled with stories of stacked large plants. Amazing! A tip-ask for a suite. The space was wonderful and included a sitting room with a comfy couch and large hammock. Otherwise, your sitting room is actually across the hall from your bedroom which is a little quirky.The hotel provided an excellent location on a small side street off La Ramblas in El Raval. This we found to be a tremendous plus as it is surrounded by diverse restaurants that aren't as tourist driven. It's a great place to meander around, people watch and explore. The shopping was also fun nearby and 2 metro stops are quite close . Take a taxi from the airport! At this time Barcelona has no Uber and because the location is a bit tough to find, down a really narrow street, it could be harder to navigate after a long trip with bags using the metro. We loved the amenities here. The ever open snack bar provided water and healthy alternatives if we just needed to grab something quickly. There was fresh pressed juice and wonderful cured meats at breakfast too which we really enjoyed. The front desk staff there was really helpful with directions and recomendations and they even included a bottle of cava in our room to celebrate our anniversary! We would return for another stay at Casa Camper in a heartbeat!","March 16, 2019","22    Casa Camper Hotel Barcelona

1252,"When we arrived our room was not ready but we were offered an upgrade and were given a complete tour of the hotel and it's amenities while we waited plus a chit for two free drinks at the bar. Our room was a corner room with three small balconies, a sitting area and a very large bathroom.the staff were all very friendly and extremely helpful.Breakfast was very good and offered hot egg dishes to order.The breakfast area was transformed to a free snack area for the balance of the day and included fresh fruit, sandwiches, soft drinks, coffee, tea and a variety of true munchies- chips, nuts, chocolate etc. A very welcome feature given that dinner in Barcelona doesn't start until 8PM at the earliest.You are a 2 minute walk from the Ramblas but being on a small laneway was not busy with pedestrian or vehicular traffic.Good restaurants within a 5 minute walk.The only negatives were: No drinking/wine glasses in the room and the absence of a desk height writing surface.The honour bar on the top floor was a nice touch as well.","March 4, 2019","22    Casa Camper Hotel Barcelona

1253,"My husband and I have traveled extensively for the last 17 years in Europe, Scandinavia and S. America. We found Casa Camper to be a truly unique travelers hotel. It provided every comfort, wonderful food and friendly helpful staff. We loved it and hated to leave! The roof top terrace and honor bar provided a calm respite from the hustle/bustle. The kitchen with made to order breakfast and 24 hour food was amazing. The basement bar was a fun spot with Archey eager to work his bar tending magic. We interacted a lot with Lucia at the front desk. She was always helpful with restaurants, transportation and any information we needed. All of the staff were great and quick to please. When our hairdryer wasn't working they responded before we got to the room to remove the Do Not Disturb. We also loved the location, just off Las Ramblas but far enough to have its own cafes, stores and restaurants. It was an enchanting experience. If we are lucky enough to return to Barcelona we wouldn't stay anywhere else.","February 26, 2019","22    Casa Camper Hotel Barcelona

1255,"First off did a lot of research on hotels for Barcelona because we are a family of 4 and traveled with a 1 year old and a 3 year old. All I can say is that this place made my trip to Barcelona more enjoyable. I have stayed and various cheap and expensive hotels in Europe but the service here takes the cake. Communication: this place answered my email promptly after booking the hotel, they even help book airport transfer because I didn’t want to deal looking for transportation with the kids, bags and strollers after a long flight from the US with cranky children with no sleep.Check-in: I was so surprised when we checked in they where so nice, showed us the hotel facilities, gave maps and suggestions of places to go around the area.Location: For me this was important, I had two strollers to push and a far hotel or a unsafe location was out of the question. Even when we did not have kids location for me was alway key. This place was 2 minutes to Las Ramblas the main street which took a 5 minute walk to Plaza Catalunya where all the hop-on buses started. Our bus for Monserrat also started there and was 15min to the Sans trans station which we took to Girona and Madrid. The Boqueria market was 5 minutes away too.Food: Breakfast was included, loved it, you can have eggs cooked any way with bacon and sausages, etc. had selections of Spanish cold cuts, cheese, bread, they make the coffee for you, juice, bottled water(to me that was important). But the main thing here is this breakfast area after serving breakfast closes for an hour and they set-up snacks that the guest could just get anytime of the day. This was worth the prize of admission alone if you had kids or even adults. Had coffee anytime I wanted, juice, yogurt, cookies, sandwiches and chips for the kids and bottled water (yes I had to say bottled water again).People: ok everything I listed out above you can also probably get at other places but the people here are so nice, I never had personal service at a hotel in Europe (my sister works for the 4 seasons so I know how personal service works staying in a bunch of them) everyone was helpful but this place was above that, decided to go to Girona a day before and I was helped booking a tour and transport that night by the guy at the front desk. I do have to mention one of the hotels employe named Anna, my 3 year old daughter really loved this place because of her, she was really nice to her gave a casa camper ball, help her during breakfast etc, these are intangibles that you don’t get in a big chain hotel (when was the last time your 3 year old kid remembered the name of the person at the hotel helping you guys?)Room: garden suite, this is what I got and did not regret it at all, it had a king bed and a queen pullout bed, even got a pack and play of the one year old that they had ready when we arrived. If you are like me and torn which one to get i suggest to pay a little more for the garden suite and thank me later. Oh those hooks in the wall was the smartest thing I have seen in a hotel room.Internet: to some people this is important and I have to say it was US fast here so your good, plus they gave us a mifi hotspot to carry around town which gave us data on our cellphones when we are out. That way I just tuned off the roaming data on my phone and used this the entire time. If your asking yes it work with google maps and Facebook and also iMessage.Negatives: ok every place has negatives and for this place don’t know if it’s even worth to mention but I’ll throw it in to make a balanced review. The location was a little bit tricky specialty for taxi cabs because you have to drive in from Las Ramblas. Some of you might want carpet in your rooms but with kids I prefer non carpet rooms, lastly no bellhop but who cares they will help you with your bags anyways. These are minor items and just nit picking which I did not even care.Conclusion: when I booked this hotel it was #2 in TripAdvisor and I didn’t want #1 because of its location that’s why I book this. Did I mention that the place was clean, even the rooms and hallways. If I go back to Barcelona I would not even think of booking any other place in fact I got 2 families already booking at this hotel because of my experience and the pictures I showed them and my daughter who told them about the nice people and free snacks she got at the hotel. By the way when people read reviews they also look at the options the reviewer had, only thing I could say is I could have book one of those fine hotel and resorts locations on my Amex card but a picked this and never regretted it.

1256,"Located right in the middle of the action, this hotel boasts spacious rooms, and 24/7 access to a pantry with all sorts of beverages and snacks, included in the room price. This includes grab and go beverages, croissant sandwiches, snacks, salads yogurt, etc. In the morning, the breakfast, also included in the room price, provides cooked to order eggs, pancakes, sausage, bacon, etc, and a buffet of local meats, cheeses, fruits etc. The pancakes were not what I was used to--very fluffy and delicious.

1258,"My son and I stayed at Casa Camper in B-28 for 3 nights. It’s a large room with a sitting room next to the bedroom. The room was well equipped and modern, the staff at the hotel quite friendly. The location is off La Rambla on a small street that’s walking distance to sites and restaurants. I chose the hotel because of the location and 24 hour snack bar. I figured that with jet lag and odd eating times it would be helpful. The only thing to note about the room is that it’s a bit dark and faces the street. The street is usually empty but skateboarders tend to skate by and the noise is loud as well as garbage trucks in the morning and people walking by after leaving the bars at night. Would definitely stay here again though.","February 10, 2019","22    Casa Camper Hotel Barcelona

1260,"The hotel announces its different nature right from the start. They buzz you in, for security. After you check-in you can use your room key to get in on your own. Although if they see you, they will buzz you in. The room setup we chose is unique, at least as far as I have seen. There are two rooms. The first is the bedroom with bathroom. Across the hallway is the second room, a mini lounge area with a second TV, couch and hammock. This arrangement came in very handy, as right after we checked in, my got sick, very sick, coughing her guts out. She stayed there for three and a half days in bed, completely drained. Luckily, I could stay in the other room. While the sofa was very narrow and uncomfortable to sleep, very uncomfortable, it sufficed. And the fact that it had a TV made the arrangement tolerable. What made the stay better than tolerable was the fact like the Artiem Madrid hotel we had just come from, the Casa Camper had an upgraded version of the free food and drinks. Sandwiches, drinks, desserts, salads, soup, potato chips, wonderful M&M's, cookies. A rotating set of choices kept it interesting. They had chicken, salmon, crab, sandwiches, a greenbean/potato salad that was very good, cheesecake, carrot cake, etc. 24 hours a day, even during breakfast. Speaking of breakfast, it was included. It was also the best breakfast I ever had. The incredibly friendly cooks made me pancakes were perfect and made even better by the real maple syrup they offered. I was tempted to have a second helping. I decided, instead, to try the omelet. Good choice. Great choice. It was hands down the best omelet I ever had. Moist, luscious, cooked perfectly, with completely fresh ingredients. Ever mouthful was heaven, sheer joy. I literally savored every mouthful. If it wassn't too late and beside I was stuffed to the gills, I would have got another one. I had omelets the next two days, but unfortunately they were only delicious, not life changing as the first one was. C'est la vie. The hot chocolate and the coffee they made and brought to you, like the food, was excellent. The OJ was very good, too. When I told the kitchen staff how extraordinary the food was, they were genuinely touched. It was an Oprah kind of moment. I think the last day I had breakfast twice, because I knew it would be a while before we got back here. What I was unaware of was that they had a lounge area on the top floor and you could sit outside, too. They had drinks, chocolate bars, etc. there. We went to see the sunset on our last day there. And while the view was not as spectacular as the one at our hotel in Segovia, it was still very nice and relaxing. I wish I had spent time there while my wife was sick. What I did know and didn't use was the pool table in the basement bar area. I should have, but I did not. Next time.The staff was top notch, as helpful as they could be and friendly, too.The location was good, too. Not terribly far from the cathedral, Palau Musica and almost next door to the modern art museum. What I particularly liked was that it was very close to a laundromat and we had to wash our clothes.What else? The bed and pillows were very good. So were the towels. The shower was very good. The back of the main room had the sink and windows all across. The view was this matrix of plants going all the way down to the ground, a little strange, but interesting. After we checked out, they stored our bags and when we came back around dinner time, they allowed us to go to get some food. I thought that was very gracious of them. And as I said, they allowed us to go the terrace area, as well. Of course, I had also told them and I was serious, that I would like to stay for a month the next time. A customer like that you want keep happy. And they did. And there is no doubt we will back. The month stay may be next year or later, as we have changed our plans for the rest of this year and Barcelona is probably off our itinerary and even if we come, it will be for a short visit.We paid more for this hotel than any other on our trip, including a 5 star hotel in Lisbon, but it was worth every penny. If you want an incredibly relaxing stay, this is your place. If you aren't sick, you may not want to leave the hotel.","January 31, 2019","22    Casa Camper Hotel Barcelona

1261,"I was recently traveling alone for business in Barcelona and stayed at the Casa Camper for the second time. Sadly, the first day of my stay, I developed a severe pinched nerve in my spine and was debilitated by the pain and could barely walk. The staff at the Casa Camper were unbelievably kind to me and treated me like family. They found a doctor to see me, went to the pharmacy to pick up medications, brought food and drink to my room. Their attention and kindness made my trip bearable despite this awful new medical problem. I cannot thank them enough!

1262,"The room was spacious for a European hotel, but we also got a corner suite, so it was expected. The amenities were average as many are what you would expect of a standard hotel. I did not think any of them were remarkable. Front desk was generally courteous, but they were not very helpful when asking for restaurant recommendations. They would usually resort to Googling, which I could do - they didn't have many good recommendations of their own. That was a bit surprising. The free food in the kitchen in the lobby was not very good; sandwiches were dry and salads were gross, so we did not utilize this very much. Turn down services was nice, and so was location, but overall I'd say it was a very average experience. Definitely did not live up to my expectations. There are other hotels in a similar price range and similar location, which are far better.","January 14, 2019","22    Casa Camper Hotel Barcelona

1264,"Excellent staff from check-in to check-out. Very quiet room. Very good location. Very good beds. They cater for your special wishes: on checking in we asked for some extra coathangers, and extra topsheets. They were supplied at once. I asked if I could have the newspaper El País every morning. And without fail I gor it every monrning (and for free). On checking in I explained to the friendly lady at reception that I was here, among other things, to practise my little-used Spanish. And so we never spoke a word of English to each other.Niggles? At breakfast you get three kinds of pre-cut Manchego type cheese, which all taste pretty much the same: brittle, acid, and little else. Mean ten gram portions of butter which would require tin openers.Same opening problem with yoghurts. And the wall colour in the rooms: abattoir red, is not to everyone's taste.

1266,"This may be a great hotel according to the travellers reviews but for sure this hotel is not child friendly or at least they don't welcome children.I was close to make a non-refunable booking at Casa Camper but I could not see any children policy on their website so I checked on booking.com where they simply say ""all chilren are welcome"" and ""no room capacity for extra beds"".After this I had the great idea to contact the hotel and ask about any extra costs for my 7 yo boy sharing the existing (and only available) bed with me and my wife.Their blunt answer was that any child above 3 years is qualified as an adult and would be charged EUR 88/night to stay with us. The rate for 2 adults is EUR 150/night and the extra fee for a child is EUR 88/night!!!!While most of highly rated hotels in Barcelona (and aroun Europe) charge only the cost of the child's breakfast (or even offer it for free in case of big hotel chains) Casa Camper probably prefer to keep the children away by charging this outrageous extra fee for a child without extra bed.Be aware before you book!","December 15, 2018","22    Casa Camper Hotel Barcelona

As an amateur photographer, it’s always nice for me if I can take some pictures from my hotel window. After being shown other available rooms, a view that I’d photograph wasn’t a reality. On the positive side, Casa Camper is in the middle of the old town, the original part of Barcelona. Nearby you can find interesting sights and excellent restaurants. If shopping is your thing, you will be very happy. Breakfast is very good and as others have mentioned, snacks are available 24hours.Our room is large as is the bathroom.","November 15, 2018","22    Casa Camper Hotel Barcelona

Also available 24/7 sandwiches, soup, desserts, yogurts, breads, tea, soft drinks, juices and coffee....all free.The Terazza on the 6th floor has an honor bar. You mark what you drink and how much on their form. The bar has a wide selection of Scotch, brandy, wines, beer etc. for a bargain rate. We spent every evening there playing cards, drinking wine and meeting fellow guests. The staff speak English and are friendly and helpful. There is no downside to staying there.

Highly recommend this place.I am overwhelmed by the services provided, They arranged birthday cake for my wife on my request from one of the best place in Barcelona (Bubo), also arranged the taxi for our journey back to airport for early morning flight.Few downsides1.

And most bedrooms look onto the quiet inner courtyard.Within easy walking distance of centre and main sights, and 3 minutes walk to beautiful gardens, 15 minutes walk to the beaches.The apartments are newly renovated and modern in an 18th century house, with a modern lift. We had an ""attic"" apartment, with bedroom, good bathroom, sitting room, dining area for four and a modern kitchen. (Although they're called attic, they have high, full ceilings and full-length windows with masses of light). There's also dining-table and chairs for six on the rooftop terrace, and 2 loungers on the upper part of the terrace, which has great views over the rooftops of Barcelona. Heating/air-conditioning too.The staff all speak English and were very helpful.The apartment was spotlessly clean. There's an Aldi small supermarket on the far corner of the large square.To sum up: beautifully peaceful, spacious and comfortable, with great views.

1280,Stayed here for 3 nights and it was a great stay. Apartment was large with two bedrooms on a split level and was plenty large enough for 3 people. The block also had a lift which was very handy as were on the 3rd floor. Check in was efficient and they allowed to check in earlier which was an added bonus. The area itself El Born is lovely with some great bars and restaurants all within a short walk. It's nice and quiet which is also an added bonus. My only gripe was that there was only salt and olive oil in the kitchen and there was no sugar or very minimal coffee but there is a supermarket very close but it would have been good to have it in each apartment. Would definitely stay here again. ,"October 7, 2018","23    Inside Barcelona Apartments Mercat

1284,"I waffled between a 5 star and a 4 star review. I believe the 5 star is accurate if you are looking for practicality and not flashy. If you are looking for luxury then this is not it. Perfection:- location in el Born area where you can walk to everything. This is the place to be. Access to markets, restaurants, local life and transportation. - Inside Barcelona staff are great (helpful and available & willing to assist). English speaking is certainly a bonus. - great newer appliances - everything you need. As a North American we are not use to dual duty appliances (washers with dryers and stoves with micro waves - thank goodness for English instructions) plus dishwasher and full size fridge and freezer. - well stocked kitchen - everything you need including dishes, cutlery, pots and pans and cookware, paper towel and dish cleaning and drying cloths and soap. Better stocked than at home. - Included is a nespresso maker with 2 coffee tabs to get you going (you can buy non-nespresso tabs at the market or Starbucks for a fraction of nespresso costs. There is also a drip coffee maker available & kettle. - air conditioning if needed. - shower is great. - large safe in bedroom. - Free wifi. - good size apartment for city living. - second bedroom if need for a 3rd person (but no second bathroom). - elevator is great for luggage but with lift-style apartment not mobility friendly. Bedroom and bathroom main floor, living and kitchen up. - tv has limited English speaking stations: satellite news (us and Britain) plus one station on tv (channel 11). - security good. Not as good:- not sprinklered (not unusual for Europe). Fire safety a bit iffy. Outside (electric) blind in bedroom if down would be a concern. - only 3 bath towels and no laundry detergent supplied. - couch is dreadfully uncomfortable, needs replacing with something more comfortable and doesn’t sit so close to the floor. - not enough toilet paper supplied but cheap enough to buy at market. I highly recommend with some considerations. ","April 16, 2018","23    Inside Barcelona Apartments Mercat

1287,"We had a nightmare journey from the airport which really didn't get us off to a good start! We were sent an e-mail prior to our arrival on the best ways to get to the apartment. We always ignore the taxi recommendation as it's too expensive, so we went for the other option which was the train. First of all it took about 15 minutes to walk from the terminal to the train station; then we waited 10 minutes for the train. The train was incredibly slow and by the time we got to the place where we needed to change, the final services had finished for the night. We then had to leave the station and get a taxi for the rest of the way. In total it took about 2 hours to get from the airport to the apartment. Simply ridiculous! We spent about €22 for this ridiculous journey when a taxi would only have cost us €35! Two years ago we travelled from Girona airport to Barcelona and that was actually quicker and far less stressful! Not only this, but the apartment asked us to phone when we landed, which I did, only to be told to phone again later. In total I phoned 3 times at various stages of our journey. The woman who met us was very nice, but when asked about our journey I said it was awful and her response was, 'Well, yes the train is very slow'. I did point out that it's probably not best to recommended it from the airport then!Aside from this bad start, everything else was pretty good. The location is very quiet, but very central. The apartment itself was fairly spacious for 3 people, but could have done with another/separate toilet. The kitchen was very well equipped. I'm never a fan of two single beds posing as a double so that wasn't overly comfortable, but there was lots of storage space in the bedrooms. The local office were incredibly helpful and we went there everyday. They even booked tickets for us and gave us discount vouchers. Overall, I would say this was a 'good' apartment. I've stayed in much more luxurious and spacious apartments in other major cities in Europe for the same price. It's also a shame that they've only picked an Ikea sofa to furnish it with (very uncomfortable!). The apartment's main appeal is its location, so I would pick it again for a few nights away, but not for anything longer. ","October 27, 2017","23    Inside Barcelona Apartments Mercat

You walk into a foyer area, bathroom and bedroom to the left, (back side of the building), and a unique curved staircase to the right, up to a living/kitchen area and also another bedroom, smaller, with a desk and juliet balcony. Living also has balcony, facing the Barcelona Cultural Center that has the prettiest rooftop. El Born shops and restaurants galore on the other side of the Cultural Ctr, and half-a-block on the other side is Parc de la Ciutadella, which is oh so beautiful and amazing. Perfect location. And train station is very close, not quite two blocks. It was very quiet, but so close to ""the action."" This was also a working vacation for my spouse, and we won't stay anywhere that doesn't have a good fast internet connection. The separation of the floors was also nice in that regard.

The staff are very helpful right from king reservations to storing your luggage for you. The first time when we stayed (August 2014), they explained everything; how to use the metro, book tickets for museums, where are the supermarkets, the quieter beaches, etc. The apartment itself (Mercat Duplex) was perfect for us, a family of 3. The location is perfect to visit the the city on foot, take the metro, take a taxi for 5 euros to the quieter beaches and the apartment is really quiet and well equipped. I would however seriously recommend they change their cleaning lady who obviously takes shortcuts. In out first visit in 2014, we were offered a mid- stay cleaning (we stayed 12 nights) which was really poorly done however we didn't mention it. In our second visit (July 2015), we again found that the floor was leaving our feet black (and no that is NOT pollution) as we had checked in 2 hours after the apartment had been cleaned. The staff at Inside Barcelona were really helpful and resent the cleaning lady and this time the floors stayed clean for 5 days!

1298,"This MERCAT apartment which is located opposite of the el born centre, is very quiet. Even though we are just on the 2nd floor (lift available), we could sleep peacefully without any disturbance, sometimes we overslept. One room faced the inside building and the other facing the walking street so one room is quiet and the other not so. Other than some noise from people on the street (better than traffic noise) and we stayed during the weekdays and not weekend, this apartment is very comfortable and peaceful. This modern clean 2 bedroom apartment could accommodate up to 4 adults and 2 kids. But maybe 1 bathroom could be a disadvantage for more than 3. Location is good with many tapas and restaurants nearby but a 25 minutes walk to plaza catalunya. Subway is near. Anyway taxi is easy and convenient especially on a hot summer day. From here to sagrada familia, a taxi costs us about 7 euro and to the plaza espanya about the same price too. Every morning, we had breakfast in the apartment since it is easy to get coffee, bread, ham and cheese from the nearby mini market. It is more economical this way for a family especially in Europe. And this kitchen serves well functionally. We also had a good size balcony at the back of bedroom which you could chill out with a glass of wine. Or even hang and dry your clothes with the clothing rack provided, if you do not want to use the dryer. They do not provide cleaning service for us since we only stayed about 5 days. Maybe more days, it will be included. Paula has been very helpful to make sure everything works and how we could explore Barcelona.

1301,"We've stayed in this apartment for 8 days in February and absolutely loved everything about it. First of all the location is absolutely excellent, right on the edge of wonderful El Born and right next to the Ciutadella Park. The complex is situated on a quiet road at the back of the Mercat del Born museum. El Born is probably one of the nicest areas in Barcelona, with lots of small streets with literally hundreds of restaurants and boutiques. The rest of Barcelona is awesome as well, but returning to El Born each night was always a pleasure.The apartment itself is great. We were welcomed by Helena, who explained everything and helped us get started. Our apartment had 2 bedrooms with double beds, a kitchen, a bathroom and quite a large livingroom. There was a nice tv, a bluetooth speaker, great wi-fi reception all throughout the apartment, a coffee machine, a dishwasher, a washing machine, a toaster, water cooker, etc. We stayed in the apartment with two small children and got an extra cod for the littlest one.

1302,We had a two bedroom apartment. Large enough for a family of four and a very well appointed kitchen.Location was excellent and as usuall for central Barcelona there were plenty of places to eat within a short stroll. It was a quiet apartment as there is no road at the front or back and there was almost no noise from the pedestrians. Wifi download strength was excellent.The girls at inside Barcelona were very helpful.Remember this is not a hotel so they meet you at the apartment to let you in. Extra charges if outside normal hours . After midnight was a 40 euro surcharge.Fully airconditioned and light apartmentVery clean.The downsides ?;+Biggest issue was a very small hot water tank. They warn you that you only have 14 minutes of hot water for a shower. That is not long for four people ! It takes 2 hours to reheat the water again.+ second biggest issue- the double bed was two beds put together. The bases were tied but the matresses were two singles and not able to be zipped together. Meaning you could fall between the matresses as they moved apart.. +No curtains in the Main bedroom- net curtains which gave privacy but would not block light. Fine in winter but in summer it would not provide a late morning sleep +Lots of cable channels........ unfortunately all but the eleven news channels are in German- There is a DVD player so if you have english speaking kids take DVDs to amuse them if you were expecting the TV would do that+ the shower is situated in the bath with a shower screen attached. Because of the way the bathroom is designed it is a narrow gap to get out of the shower because of the toilet. Could see an issue for the elderly or those not so able to safely get out of the bath.Would i stay again ? absolutely even with the limited hot water.,"February 3, 2015","23    Inside Barcelona Apartments Mercat

More important, their staff (thank you Paula) helped us in planning the trip and in the bumps on our trip (US Airways--no thank you).The apartment was very safe, clean and fit our family well (2 parents, 20 year old and 17 year old.)It was quiet, had good beds an a decent shower. Being in the Born was perfect for great restaurants and access to the subway and a 15 minute walk to Eixample--but much hipper than the Eixample neighborhood.Gracias Inside Barcelona.","January 1, 2015","23    Inside Barcelona Apartments Mercat

1304,"This apartment was fabulous. Perfectly located, lovely décor, everything we could possibly want including excellent wifi included in the cost. Cannot speak highly enough of the service offered by the great staff at Inside Barcelona. We felt so at home and so comfortable and any questions, directions or bookings for tours was organised without any hassle by staff at the office which was just a short stroll away. It was such a great experience to have an apartment instead of a hotel, especially as we had a lengthy stay in Barcelona due to work commitments.","December 4, 2014","23    Inside Barcelona Apartments Mercat

1305,"We stayed in a duplex apartment which was located on the 5th floor for 5 nights at the end of October.The apartment layout had the main bedroom (window on to the rear of building)and bathroom on the lower floor, the kitchen, second bedroom and sitting area were on the upper floor.The main bedroom had its own air conditioning and there was an outer shutter on the window that could be lowered to block out light and any noise.Windows from the 2nd bedroom and sitting area overlooked the restored Mercat del Born.The kitchen was very well equipped with fridge, hot plates, oven, dishwasher and washing machine. There was also plenty of utensils such as kitchen knives, pots and pans, bowls and glasses. Unusually for Spain there was also a toaster and a jug. It was also great to have mugs rather than cups for tea and coffee. The beds were comfortable, the bathroom was a good size, there was plenty of storage space, the upper floor windows opened to provide plenty of light and fresh air and both areas were very quiet.In addition, the El Born area is a great spot for bars and restaurants, is great for window shopping with lots of old streets to wander along. It also very close to sights such as the Picasso museum, the beach and the zoo and surrounding gardens. It is about a 10 minute walk to the nearest Metro ( the station is closer but the trains are less frequent). The market (a highlight) and Las Ramblos is about 20 minute walk. An added bonus was our apartment is just up the street from the La Paradeta so we couldmonitor the queue from the balcony!Finally, as other reviews have noted the staff at Inside Barcelona are very friendly and helpful. They have also thought about what visitors need and so provide easy to follow written instructions on how to get to their offices from the airport, detailed information on how to use the facilities in the apartment and maps of the surrounding area showing facilities you might need.The result is a very professional and through approach to providing excellent accommodation whilst maintaining a friendly and personal touch in delivering the service.One small example, I asked about getting back to the airport from the apartment. Paula produced written instructions on the process and then found and printed the timetables relevant to the approximate time of our departure: friendly, thorough, professional.My thanks and congratulations to Inside Barcelona on providing such a high quality experience.","November 22, 2014","23    Inside Barcelona Apartments Mercat

1306,"Everything was absolutely perfect. We got detailed instructions how to get to the office from the airport. It was really near to the train station. All the area was really nice. The apartment is close to the office and nice park. There are a lot of restaurants. Supermarket and pharmacies are very close. It is about 15 minutes from the beach.Paula was very friendly and helpful. She walked us to the apartment from the office. She explained us everything necessary about apartment. We got map with nearest supermarket, pharmacies, and recommended restaurants for breakfast, lunch and dinner and so on. We got list of basic information and extra services. Paula showed us he most interesting places of Barcelona on the map and she told us how to get there.We were surprised that we have a terrace as we didn’t expect it. It was great. We felt there as home. The apartment was very nice and clean. It looks like exactly as on the photos. It is very well equipped.

1307,"We have just had a fabulous 3 night stay in the 2 bedroom Mercat apartment. Inside Barcelona were extremely helpful from the moment I booked a few months ago, up to the moment we left to return to London. Their wonderful staff escorted us to the apartment, ran through all the information regarding the accommodation, location and best places to visit and on departure allowed us to leave out luggage at the office for our late flight. The location of these apartments is perfect - El Born is a quiet location away from the hustle of the city and is home to countless little cafes, tapas bars and delightful shops. We were also perfectly located to be easy walking distance from the fabulous beach, gothic area, Ramblas etc. and had no need for the metro or buses other than the fab tourist bus that took us around the town.

The apartment was secure and also had a safe. We felt very secure in the El Born area which is close to Bari Gotic. Inside Barcelona provided very helpful information as to nearby restaurants, markets and transport. The closest metro station is Jeume I which is about a 10 minute walk away.

1310,"Travelling with teenagers, we've learned that apartments are so much better (and no more expensive) than staying in hotels - and so much nicer and more family friendly. We have just stayed at the Apartments Mercat and I am delighted to report that this place has totally made our short trip to Barcelona completely wonderful ! What really delighted me most however was the neighbourhood; I echo everything already said by other reviewers about the apartment itself and the helpfulness/friendliness of the staff, the proximity to everything and so on. But what I wanted to highlight was the El Born district itself - beautiful old town feel, narrow winding streets, the park on your doorstep, and hundreds of bars, tapas restaurants, little shops, plus the beautifully restored market building which contains some carefully preserved excavated remains of the old city. I will without doubt stay here again, next time dumping the kids so we can explore more of previously mentioned bars!","May 28, 2014","23    Inside Barcelona Apartments Mercat

1311,"These lovely apartments are located behind the newly refurb'd Mercat del Born, now known as the Born Cultural Centre, at one end of Passeig del Born. The one I've stayed in several times is on two levels, with a bedroom and bathroom on the ground floor and 2nd bedroom, kitchen & living space upstairs. They are modern, spacious, clean and in a great location - a winning combination! The Inside BCN team are great and I have booked with them for years. Carrie in their booking office is friendly & helpful, as are the staff who actually take you to your apartment. They make everything very simple & easy for their guests i.e. leave the keys inside the apt when you leave - so no big treks to an office to drop them off. I can't recommend the company and these apartments highly enough!","May 25, 2014","23    Inside Barcelona Apartments Mercat

1312,"My wife and I booked a 4th floor apartment (with terrace) in a Mercat (El Born) apartment from 4th to 7th May 2014. The Inside Barcelona website accurately reflected what is actually there.We had no problem re the original booking or with our subsequent direct email contact with Inside Barcelona staff. Any queries or advice we requested before travelling and also whilst in Barcelona were dealt with very efficently and promptly. The staff were very professional but also warm and welcoming and could not do enough to make sure that you enjoyed your holiday. The compact apartment located in a quite well lit street was very clean and comfortable and was absoutely great with a nice open air secluded sunny terrace. It was in a great position for a whole range of sites including the Gothic Quarter, Picasso Museum (free entry but big queues on a Sunday afternoon), Barceloneta, beaches, zoo, train station, aquarium, Port Veil, La Rambla etc. The Sagrada Familia is also within 25 minute walking distance of the apartment. There are a lot of great bars for tapas and also all manner of restaurants depending on your preferences in the immediate vicinity of the apartment. Overall a great location for exploring this part of the city.Prior to travelling I did a lot of research online to try and identify top rated tapas bars to visit when we got to Barcelona. I strongly recommend that you don't bother. All of the supposedly top rated tapas bars are full to bursting with tourists who have all been online identifying top rated tapas bars!! We eventually ended up just trying places we liked the look of and within which we thought the customers were mostly Spanish. This paid off for us on a visit to Barceloneta when quite by chance we ate lunch in La Bombeta, Carrer de la Maquinista. Great food, very Spanish - and few tourists at the time of our visit.Since this was our first visit to Barcelona via El Prat T2 we wondered how easy it would be to access the flat. On leaving the inside of the airport turn right and walk up to the Aerobus stance where a single ticket into Placa Catalunya cost 5.90 euros per person. On arrival at Placa Catalunya we had a pleasant 20 minute stroll downhill to the Gothic district and to the Inside Barcelona office. In overall terms a great short break much enhanced by having a great Inside Barcelona apartment with superb staff.Killieman","May 8, 2014","23    Inside Barcelona Apartments Mercat

1314,"The staff at Inside BCN office are amazing, so helpful, attentive, knowledgeable and they genuinely want you to enjoy your holiday/break to the full. They suggest trips and will print off tickets for you from their computers saving money on visits to Sagrada Famillia and the Hop on Hop off buses.Positives - Location is fantastic, right in the El Born district, lots going on, lovely shops, bars and restaurants very close at hand. We stayed on the top floor apartment 1, excellent views from the roof top patio. Very clean apartment and well equipped if you wish to cook meals etc. Bathroom has just a shower, toilet and sink. Negatives - The bed linen was old and worn, the towels hard and wash worn and the bed (2 single beds pushed together and made of memory foam) was hard and extremely uncomfortable. There is a sofa bed in the lounge which is the main comfy seating spot - not comfy at all. Old, lumpy and stained, it's covered over with throws and cushions. Certainly not enough comfy seating for potentially 4 guests.All in all acceptable, but I would not stay here again.","January 23, 2014","23    Inside Barcelona Apartments Mercat

1316,"Stayed in the Atico apartment (I believe there are two Atico /pentouse apartments) which is a one bedroom apartment on two levels with a stunning terrace with wonderful views over the city. Bedroom and bathroom is downstairs with the living room, kitchen and terrace being on the upper level.Could not fault this accomodation in any way. The terrace gets the sun all day and is lovely and private and comes with two sun loungers and a table with six chairs, there is also outside lighting. The apartment is well equipped if you wanted to be self sufficient and there are a few supermarkets within a couple of minutes walk. There`s also a fabulous wine shop a couple of doors down if you fancy a night in. Satellite tv was brilliant as was free wifi. Apartment was nice and quiet at night.. Bed was nice and comfy and shower was excellent.This is in the El Born district which, having extensively explored Barcelona for 5 days,i can say with confidence this is the best area to stay. The area is safe with charming streets all a buzz with activity from numerous tapas bars, restaurants and open air cafes and bars. You could eat in a different restaurant every night for a year with ease. You can easily walk to the beach and all major sites from here. If you choose to use the metro I suggest you get a T10 ticket which gives you ten trips for appox 9euro. Both of us shared a card and still had a few trip left at the end of our holiday. This also gets you to and from the airport and if you go and see Barcelona play football it`ll get you to the stadium and back as well.We booked this apartment directly from www.insidebarcelona.com who were fabulous. They give you all the info you need for a wonderful holiday in Barcelona. They provide you with maps of the city which showing tourist sites,bus, tram and metro routes and they are able to book trips and visits to tourist sites sometimes getting you a discount and helping you to avoid queues. They can recommend and book restaurants They give you a 24 hour phone number so if you experience any problems they are only a phone call away which is quite reassuring. I would like to visit Barcelona again and would most definitely stay here again as this apartment totally enhanced our holiday.","October 7, 2013","23    Inside Barcelona Apartments Mercat

You can expect a great briefing from the Inside Barcelona Staff about do's and don'ts before you start touring the city. They were also very helpful cues on how to visit different historical sites. The location of the apartment is great because it is quiet. Our unit was facing the market and had a small balcony. The beds were very comfortable.

Location is superb, located in El Born, it's within walking distance to Las Ramblas and Barceloneta beaches and restaurants and Ciutadella Park. Close to the apartment is all you need: supermarket, pharmacy, lots of cafes, restaurants and tapas bars. Transportation is also very good, metro and Estacion de Franca are two minutes away from the apartment.Park and Barceloneta are perfect for jogging, and there are two swimming pools and a gym, just around the corner. Apartment itself is very clean, modern and well furnished with all amenities you might need (including washing machine and dish washer) and air conditioning. Beds are very comfortable, so we had excellent sleep, the area is very quite, so there was no noise outside during the night. Special kudos go to InsideBCN staff and first of all to Paula for being one great host. From the moment we booked the apartment to the moment we checked out she made sure our stay was perfect. All the recommendations she gave were perfect and overall her assistance and hospitality were outstanding.

1322,"We stayed at the end of June for few days in one of Mercat apartments; we weren’t lucky enough to have the access to a terrace, but except that, we had everything we need it for a great stay: a very good location (very close to Las Ramblas and the beach); all the instruments for a self catering style; nice furniture. Speaking about furniture, this was one of the points that make me decrease the stars: the single bed in the small bedroom was making such a big noise that my little boy was not able to fall asleep, but only with difficulty. The same noise we could hear it from our bedroom. We did not ask for a change in this matter, so I don’t know if they would have been able to help. Another minus for the apartment is the fact that you have to pay in order the towels to be changed/refreshed. This is going only to increase their expenses, as the guests will use the washing machine in order to correct that…Other than that, I would recommend the apartments to anyone looking for a great location and great staff (the girls are having the answers to all of your questions!).","August 1, 2013","23    Inside Barcelona Apartments Mercat

1323,"We are a family with a young child (almost 2) and we decided that for our city break, we would pay a little more and have an apartment. We seen the positive reviews on here and they really are not exaggerated. The apartments are spotlessly clean, bundled with nice little features and in a really great location. Our taxi cost 35 euro to the drop off point suggested by the company and the apartments are approximately 10 minutes walk from their offices. We were given a thorough explanation on the features of the apartment, places to visit and general transport advice by the representative who assured us they were always available if we required anything.Travelling with a young child, we did require a cot and a baby bath (as our apartment only had a shower) and they were there on arrival.The apartments came with WiFi included and had automatic closing window shutters to keep out the early morning sunlight if you wanted to sleep in. There is plenty of other information on what to do in Barcelona so I will not echo that. I would try and split your time between Las Rambles and the harbour, as both offer different things.The apartments were ideally situated, with the park and zoo behind you and the market in front. It is around 20-30 minutes walk to Las Rambles and about 20 minutes to the harbour. The walking is the best thing as you get to take in the city and the quaint shops and cafes it has to offer. You are far enough away not to be amongst the liveliness of Las Rambles but close enough for it to be easily accessible.To conclude, the apartments offer you a great self catering experience at an ideal location.","June 30, 2013","23    Inside Barcelona Apartments Mercat

The apartment is well furnished with modern equipment. Washer-drier was very useful. We had a comfortable stay though there was some noise during day (restoration of the mercat opposite to the apartment.) The building does not have a reception. They meet you in front of the apartment to give your key. But the office is 10 minutes away if you need any help.

1331,"The apartment--Mercat Duplex--was perfect for 3 people. The location, in terms of Barcelona is excellent--however there is a huge construction project right in the front of the building. They begin working before 8 on the weekdays and work until 6, so you cannot open the windows unless you enjoy the sound of breaking cement. On the bright side, we were always able to find our way back, due to the two giant cranes out front of our building. I was told of the noise upon check-in. It would have been nice to have known sooner, which would have given me an option to stay somewhere else, but I guess no one would rent the apt if they knew about the noise, so that is probably why we were not told. We had come from Paris where we had a lovely week, so the noise did not hamper our stay that much, but would have if this had been our only stop and we were looking to relax during the day. The neighborhood is very safe, even at night, and the tapa bars and restaurants are wonderful. The shopping is good too. I would suggest, if you rent an apt from this company, to ask whether it is next to the construction site. The people who work at Inside BCN are very nice and helpful. But one time when I needed some assistance with a cell phone they loaned me, they were all too busy to help. Overall, I gave them a very good rating, due to the nice apartment. The kitchen was well stocked, the coffee maker worked, the fridge was cool. I guess it's not their fault that the construction is taking place. (And is supposed to take years to complete, from what I gathered.) I probably would have stayed elsewhere had I known about the construction. The other thing that bothered us was we were only given three small hand towels and three bath towels to last six days. A few extra hand towels would have been a nice touch.","June 6, 2011","23    Inside Barcelona Apartments Mercat

1333,"Our family of 4 stayed in Barcelona for 2 nights after exiting a cruise. We were promised a secure luggage location since we were arriving so early. Upon arrival, Eric was there to greet us and secure our luggage with a large locker for each family. Quick check-in that included a briefing on everything we needed to know about the hotel which also included a map with descriptions on places to see and eat. The room was very spacious with everything working and a kitchen area that was ready for long term stays if cooking meals etc... Plenty of hot water and since it was very hot (Heat Wave) the AC system took a while to cool down the room. The only suggestion I have for the rooms is to leave the AC running so the first few hours in the room have a better welcoming experience. We stayed on the 6th floor in room #63. There was some noise pass into the room so if you had loud neighbors that could be a problem but only 2 or 3 rooms per floor so our stay was very quiet. Nice place to stay and we were all very happy with things all the way around. Thanks Eric for taking the time to explain your lovely city and Boutique Apartments. Will stay with you again!!","July 10, 2019","24    Eric Vokel Boutique Apartments - Gran Via Suites

The apartment was conveniently located to several places to eat, supermarkets and shopping. The Rocafort Metro was just a block away and made travel extremely easy.

The apartment is huge and provides everything you need for cooking, cleaning and making yourself feel at home. As a young couple had a very enjoyable stay. A metro stop is 2 minutes round the corner which takes you to all the key places in Barcelona as well as it only taking 25 minutes to walk to Catalunya square (central Barcelona). All I would say is that one morning the room next to us was being cleaned and you can literally hear everything very loudily next door, it's as if the cleaners were in our room!

The location is excellent, just three blocks for the plaza España and the magic fountains, a renovated former bull fighting stadium into a shopping center, and a 15-minutes walk from the plaza Catalunya.The bathroom is rather small but more than adequate. The staff is super friendly, quickly responding to e-mails even on Sunday.If you want to be picky, you could say that there is more than usual street noise compared with a comparable hotel, due to the busy street where it is located.

Like a glove for this trip. I say almost perfect as we have some small issues with the room but nonetheless Andy, who I consider my top man as he put up with the fussy British couple to accommodate us without hesitation. Let's just say I am used to rent another genre of hotel rooms per se but. I was pleased surprise of the large room as it was cozy and didn't stress my eyes as it was pleasant decorated.

1350,"Booked a one bedroom apt for the 3 of us for 5 nights on 26 Nov. The room is just right for us since we can all fit into the king size bed, but if 3 adults, will probably need to use the sofa bed in the living room. Which might be a little cramp.The apt is fully equipped with washing machine and all the cooking appliances. Can replenish all the necessities like, washing powder, shower gel, shampoo, oil, salt and pepper from the reception. The apt we had was quiet and clean, no complains at all. Nice balcony too with beautiful sunrise. Staff were friendly and helpful.Great location especially travelling to Monserrat since it’s 10 mins walk from Espanya. Rocafort Subway is juz round the corner. And the fish and chips shop near the apt is a must try.But think they should add some hooks in bathroom for the guests to hang the clothes and towels while showering. For those travelling to the apt using the Aerobus, do note that the bus stops are not very obvious and you need to press the bell for the driver to stop. We missed our stop and dropped at Catalunya instead.Would definitely stay here again if ever have a chance to visit Barcelona.","December 27, 2018","24    Eric Vokel Boutique Apartments - Gran Via Suites

We enjoy buying local ingredients and used the kitchen fully. It was great. We also appreciate Erics corner. You must go there to know.. also So many conveniences close by- Condis market, metro station, buses, eateries, Plaza españa, cafes .. las Ramblas was close enough but far enough to avoid the chaos. Renting a bike nearby is cheap. Whatever we needed, the staff was there to help. We wish we could step out into the lanai area by the kitchen but maybe its to keep us safe.

Nice accommodation, clean rooms, well equipped flat, helpful staff.They sent us an email a few days to confirm arrival date/time and give us essential information. We were arriving out of hours so were expecting to use the self check in machine - but this didn't have our details on it. However we were expected and there was still a member of staff available to help us check in and we had no real issues.There's tea, coffee, apples, soap and condiments downstairs which are free to take (during office hours). The building feels pretty secure and despite being near a big road it's really quiet inside (except for a few clanging metal doors). There's a small but very functional lift if you're on a high floor. Our room faced the rear, with a balcony overlooking a very Barcelona housing area - so you feel like a local!Downstairs lockers are available to use on the day you arrive or leave, so no worries if you have an early or late flight. They use a refundable one Euro. Also toilets in the locker room.The building is maybe 20 minutes walk from La Rambla, 45 minutes from Sagrada Familia. But there's a metro stop less than 100m away, for those who don't want to walk. It's also pretty close to aerobuses to/from the airport.There are a few grocery shops within 500m, including one two doors down.The kitchen has pans, crockery, cutlery, coffee machine, toaster, kettle, etc. All clean and functional. (Note to Eric Vökel - would be great to have plastic utensils for use on the non stick pans!).All in all, a nice place to stay.

As we stayed over a week, the apartment was cleaned half way through, and on a further night we came back to unexpectedly find more fresh towels added.The breakfasts were beautifully presented and everything came wrapped separately. During our stay, it was our daughter's birthday and we came back in the evening to find a small gift waiting for her from Eric !!I cannot recommend Eric Vokel highly enough - from the courteous staff, to the clean and beautiful facilities, to the perfect location - halfway between Placa D'Espanya and Place D'Catalunya.Look forward to Eric Vokel opening up apartments in other cities so we can stay there too.","August 12, 2018","24    Eric Vokel Boutique Apartments - Gran Via Suites

It was also fully equipped with everything needed for a family stay. The cleaners came and cleaned our apartment once, providing us with fresh towels and bedsheets! All in all, I would highly recommend this apartment to stay at as not only are the staff incredible, the apartment is situated in the middle of town making it easy to travel between different places via metro/bus or by foot!

1389,"I’ve stayed in hundreds of hostels over the last 10 years. This is the first time I’ve been compelled to write a negative review. Stayed in the 8 bed standard dorm. It was small and cramped, which is fine as we were expecting this from a cheaper room. The floors were filthy with hair all over. It seemed the only cleaning that took place was to throw out my toothbrush and toothpaste while I left it on the sink for 5 minutes to get something from the room. Aside from this, and by far the worst problem, was the <6 month old baby in our dorm. Why anyone thought this would be acceptable is entirely beyond me. The baby slept on a bunk with the mother each night - which in itself is dangerous. Obviously, being an infant, it kept our whole dorm up all night. The hostel’s website stated that it’s family friendly, which is fine, but this is just not ok. Why not upgrade them? There’s no changing facility, so the baby was changed on the bed. In an 8 bed dorm. In a hostel. When the baby wasn’t crying, the water moving through pipes upstairs was super loud and grating. So we basically got no sleep the entire 4 nights we were here. The location is good. Garcia is a great suburb. The common area was fine but had 0 atmosphere. Breakfast was fine. Don’t bother unless you’re booking a private room.

The staff are lovely and always there to help if you need anything (Ola! thanks a lot!); they know the area well and will always point you in the right direction. The location is very central. There's a real family atmosphere within the hostel; outgoing and sociable, yet relaxed and mature.

1413,"One of my favourite accommodations of my trip so far. The staff were so friendly and helpful! They also went way beyond what I'd expect of hotel staff. When I had my purse stolen at the metro the staff were very helpful with directions to a nearby police station, let me use the computer at like 1am to cancel my credit card, and one guy even let me use his mobile when I couldn't work the landline!! Very very impressed with this kindness and sympathy. I know not many travellers will experience this kind of issue but it goes to show the staff are looking out for their tenants :) In general terms as a hostel, the rooms were clean, security lockers large and lockable (byo lock or rent one I believe) and wifi was fast. Other roommates were friendly. The showers were hot and had good pressure. Breakfast was 3.5 euros but was a pretty impressive spread, probably better value than any cafe in the area. Check in:check out was easy too. The hostel was located near the metro and was also within easy walking distance to locations like park guell, the beach, or la sagrada familia. Would definitely stay again! ","September 6, 2016","25    Gracia City Hostel

The good news is that I had the whole room to myself the first night! The wifi is great! My second night, I had one roommate who was very friendly! The breakfast is a great deal as well with great food! For a small price, someone will make you eggs and bacon, and that comes with muffins, cereal, and orange juice! It's all really delicious!

The roof top pool was amazing and was a welcome place to cool down after taking in the sights of beautiful Barcelona! The pool lifeguards were friendly and charismatic which could not be said of the hotel reception staff who could barely speak English and certainly couldn’t offer any advice/support on transportation options for getting into the city as the hotel is 1.9mikes from the centre! We found the reception staff to be useless and just did or own research but a bit disappointing considering the standard of hotel!! The breakfast was outstanding however the reception staff did not inform us that breakfast started later on a Saturday so we miss out as we had to get to the Airport!

1446,"We arrived at the hotel around 11am after disembarking from our cruise at the port of Barcelona. Upon our arrival the lobby was extremely full and we were told that they were checking in people for a convention and that we could drop off our luggage and come back later to check in and pick up our room keys. This was a good option for us because we were planning on visiting Parc Guell, so we dropped off our luggage and returned a few hours later. By that time the lobby was quiet and check in was a breeze. Our room was clean and comfortable. Didn't have a lot of time to explore the area because we left to Paris the next day, so can't give any information about nearby food or shopping. The only downside to this hotel would be the staff at the breakfast buffet. We had breakfast there the morning before leaving to Paris and were extremely disappointed. We were finishing our breakfast 15 minutes after the buffet had already closed and food had been picked up and were asked to leave because the restaurant needed to be cleaned. We weren't the only ones still eating. There were 2 more tables still finishing up their breakfast and they were also asked to leave. This took us by surprise because usually restaurants wait until you are done eating and leave on your own even if they have already closed, so to us this was extremely rude. Maybe a custom of the area? Not sure, but a complete downer in customer service for us.Anyway, other than teaching their breakfast staff better customer service, the hotel is fine.

I staff member actually located my daughters pink tiger we got from Copenhagen so I was really happy with that.Negatives:-- One or two of the staff were just rude. I don’t know if they are on work experience or just don’t get it, but when I am travelling with young children I want you to make my life pain free - especially if I’m an Accor member and have already checked in. I do not want to be hanging standing with my son asleep on my shoulder while you recheck my entire booking and ask for my blood type.- I was told the location was nearby a metro station, but honestly it was quite a distance to many of the main sites in Barcelona (you realise this when getting cabs to places). This being said the location felt extremely safe and welcoming and I did not feel concerned walking around late at night.- Pool was unheated - which meant the kids while enjoying themselves for 5-10 mins got cold quickly.","June 15, 2019","26    Novotel Barcelona City

Standard 4 star hotel and the rooms are spacious and functional, The roof top swimming pool and bar was always very crowded and in our 4 days there we didnt get a seat or a swim because of some many other quests who seemed to be there all day. The check in and check out was very efficient and in particular Gabriel was very helpful and spoke many languages. The buffet breakfast was a major disappointed - whilst the choice of fruit was exceptional, the remainder on offer was pretty standard - just eggs and local meats. OK though for a start for the day and the manager was very good at moving people around in an overcrowded area.","June 13, 2019","26    Novotel Barcelona City

Both in the bar, at reception and at breakfast I felt that they would rather be elsewhere. I had to ask the reception girl what time breakfast was and where it was as she didn't tell me anything.","June 9, 2019","26    Novotel Barcelona City

There are numerous eating places & shopping across the hotel in Glories mall.

1456,"7 friends had 3 different bookings for 5 rooms. #1: 30 minutes before arrival at the hotel my friend got a sms from the hotel that her room was cancelled. She called and were told they had cancelled the room because her creditcard had expired. She asked if they could hold a room for 15 minutes, as we would soon arrive at the hotel. But no….. When we got to the hotel 10 minutes later, my friends finally managed to get a room at the same price as the original booking. #2: I booked and prepaid for 2 rooms, checked in and went to my room. The second room was given my other friends. #3: When I got to my room, the reception called and said there was a mistake, I had to bring my luggage and come down again. The hotel staff said we had cancelled the 2 rooms of the third booking, but that was not the case. My friend only cancelled 1 room, she had printed the booking confirmation and even called to hotel earlier to confirm. But no… They said we only had 2 rooms and we suddenly got two different rooms with extra beds. We asked if we could book one more and pay for it now, but no. ""no other rooms available"". After I checked the internet, and different booking sites had available rooms! But at higher price. They claimed this happened because a change of the name of the guest in one of the rooms in my #2 reservation! So that was why two rooms of the #3 reservation was cancelled...?!? I dont understand.2 completly different reservations, made by different persons, and still they mix them.","June 4, 2019","26    Novotel Barcelona City

We had many issues to get a simple invoice from our stay. It took 6 hours and 2 return visits to the hotel to have them issue a simple invoice with the correct data. If you are in a hurry to catch a plane or if you have to go to work, they simply don’t care.For business, maybe we will continue to use this hotel due to it’s price and location.

The rooms were clean and well equipped and similar standard to other Novotels we have stayed in. The breakfast was very impressive and there was great choice.

The room was nice although perhaps a bit bigger for a family but we coped and wasn’t a problem as it’s just a place to sleep and rest. Staff were good at giving advice and booked us hop on and hop off tickets. Negatives would be the elevators. With so many people at the hotel I would expect more than 3 lifts which was frustrating during busy periods. The most frustrating part was when the key cards to take you to your floor decided to stop working so you would be going back and forth. One time I spent a good 15 minutes between lifts and then had enough and walked to the 17th floor. Other frustrating bit was the one day we had sunshine my kids wanted to use the pool but couldn’t as no lifeguard about. He was there when it was raining so didn’t make sense.

Camp Nou and Train Station is a little drive and it is quite a bit away from the airport (40 euros). Most of the Barcelona attractions are not too far via taxi.

1473,"Ok the check in was fine although no early check in allowed so expect to be waiting until 2pm if it’s busy. The neighbourhood seems ok. Food wise there are some reasonable restaurants in the shopping centre nearby and about 10 minutes walk there’s quite a few restaurants. The good bits are that you can get supplies for your room easily from the carrefour supermarket a few minutes walk away. There is a taxi rank opposite the hotel and so we had no problems with getting a taxi when we went out. The fare from the airport was about 30 euros by taxi. Inside the decor is nice and modern. The only downside is that there are only 3 lifts so at peak time there can be a delay to get a lift. I think the longest we waited was about 8 minutes. The restaurant was very good for breakfast lots of freshly made food and I would suggest well worth it as breakfast options outside seemed a little sparse. The restaurant opens for breakfast at 0700hrs. On our first night there we decided to have an evening meal in the restaurant but this was not so good. They open at 1900hrs, it’s very smart but the food was not great with the worst bit being my burger which after having a bite turned out to be very pink in the centre. They did take 3 euros off the €13 cost of the burger for that. I would eat out for meals apart from breakfast. All the staff were pleasant and most spoke English to some degree. The room itself was clean and smart. But they had no bath in the standard rooms. The bed had a good firm base which was very good for both myself and my wife as we suffer from poor backs. Soundproofing seemed good and we were not disturbed by any noise. So overall we were happy and would stay again. ","March 19, 2019","26    Novotel Barcelona City

1481,"I was really excited about this trip. The reviews for this hotel were great so what could go wrong?.. Boy! was I in for a surprise. I arrived to on January 15th with my cousin and sister, my reservation was for the 16th but we were going to stay in my cousins room for that night. I explained this to the front desk staff who for the most part was Ok but not Alba. she was rude from the beginning. My cousins room was advertised as ""sleeps 4"" when I told Alba she said it does but 2 of those ""adults"" have to be children (never heard of this before) I then continue to tell her then why is it advertise as adults, it should say children and being the rude person that she was she said that it is impossible for the site to say that (I booked through Expedia). She asked me ""well what are you going to do?"" and I said (at this point I am tired and annoyed with the fact that I have to go through this on my arrival) ""you aren't giving me any choice so ill pay for a room. Having friends who work in Hospitality, once I arrived back home, told me that was my first mistake. I should have asked to see the room, clearly she was trying to make a sale. I pay for the room and she tells me multiple times ""this room will not have breakfast included but the other room (my cousins) did"" I said ""fine, I don't really care about breakfast"" She made sure she said it again while still being rude. We end up not having breakfast the next day because we woke up late, guess it worked out. On Friday the 18th we wake up early for breakfast and when they ask for our room numbers we give it to the person checking, my sister and I go in and when my cousin gives her her room number it tells her breakfast is not included on her reservation and will have to pay. I had to take a deep breath. When we were done we decided to deal with it once we got back from exploring the city. We asked one of the other girls working and she was no help, one of the guys actually took down our info and said someone will gt back to us..NOTHING. We end up leaving to Madrid as this was part of the trip and again said we would address it once back in the hotel. Jackpot, Alba was in the night we got back who is the person who gave us the information. she DENIED everything. She said she never told us breakfast was included, still on a very high horse and rude. I get it, deny, deny deny but wow! I started calling Expedia, she called us liars and how she has been working there for a long time and will never give the wrong information out, Ha! Little did they know I have family in Spain and briefly told them what was happening and the kind of treatment we were receiving. I asked Alba for a a complaint sheet, she moved quickly but not quick enough before I said and I want the town hall complaint sheet NOT the hotel one. Oh Alba, poor flustered self all of a sudden was shocked we knew what we were talking about. The manager came out, all of explained what has been happening with this particular employee and instead of giving us the benefit of the doubt actually just said to us ""Alba has been with us since we opened and our guest have wonderful things to say about her"" really?!!! I mean, NEVER have I experience this. The only thing she offered was a 50% off breakfast the next day, I said ""oh great, we leave tomorrow"". I filled out the sheet which is numbered and they have to give in to the town hall. I asked my family to follow up. I DO NOT recommend this hotel to anyone. The hotel itself was cute but the staff is absolutely HORRIBLE. I did not stay there for free, I payed for everything. Alba, red glasses and her permed red hair is ABSOLUTELY horrible and should not work in hospitality.","February 11, 2019","26    Novotel Barcelona City

1482,"We wanted a modern hotel which was near shops and good value for money. This hotel was a very good find.The check in process was efficient and the hotel was 5 minutes walk from a mall which had good mid range stores and supermarkets. I was surprised as one reviostated that the shops were useless so not sure what they were looking for. There were no high end stores but those there were ok for the average person travelling with eateries if you did not want to pay the hotel prices.The beach is apparently a few minu away but as it was February we did not bother to look it up.The room was clean but had an awful smell which could only be described as smelly socks. This smell did not diminished the entire 2 nights of our stay and was very off putting. It was a shame as the shower was great and the overall appears of the room was clean. Well.....the carpet had seen better days!There were tea and a safe in the room and a lower point with a mirror (thank you God) most hotels have the power point in the opposite place to the socket which I don’t understand!We didn’t eat at this hotel so cannot comment I’m the food. There was a gym ( God is good) again as so many hotels lack one so I could work out and it was 24 hiours.... Hallelujah! It consisted of 2 running machines, 1 cross trainer, and 2 bikes. It also had a variety in sizes of free weights and mats for floor work. There as also a multi/gym apparatus which was just awful. Netherless a sufficient array of equipment for usage with no staff or reception area as the room key was used for access.The other annoying thing about the room was the noise the heating system made. It would always the dead..... literally. I found it hard to fall asleep but the bed was very comfortable so I didn’t have to listen to it too long before I dropped offf..... there is a God!The train statin was approximately 7 mins walk and getting into the centre was easy. A taxi cost €12-18. There was always a taxi waiting outside the hotel. Overall the hotel was good apart from the smell and the noise but I would definitely stay here again.

1484,"We came here as a couple for the weekend, the hotel check in was fast and staff very helpful and polite. Our room was lovely and felt luxurious, it was clean and had everything we needed for a comfortable stay. The roof bar and terrace area was fab and we’d love to come back when the weather is warmer to take full advantage of it. The hotel is situated in a great area to be able to access everything you need. Great shopping centre opposite, and metro close by giving you easy access to the rest of the city. And lots of other things to see.We went to Camp Nou, which was great even if you’re not much of a footie fan! We also went to St Joseph’s market, the gothic cathedral and wandered around that area all day, so much to see and do! We also visited some of Gaudí‘ swirl which is breathtaking.We highly recommend staying at this beautiful hotel and enjoying all that Barcelona has to offer.

1485,"Took my girlfriend to Barcelona for her 21st birthday and it was brilliant. This hotel is lovely, rooms are spacious comfortable modern and have amazing views. All the hotel staff were brilliant and the staff on the front desk helped us book a couple of things to do.When you come back in the evening you have plenty shops and restaurants across the road and you're right next to a pickup location for the city tour. Taxi cost €9 to the port and €8 to the centre, although the centre is only 20 minutes walk and plenty to see along the way.Stayed May 2018, it was around 22 degrees during the day and the bar and pool on the roof terrace are superb. Would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone travelling to Barcelona!","January 19, 2019","26    Novotel Barcelona City

1487,"Great location great a few minutes walk to the metro from where you can get anywhere. Hopon hopoff bus stops nearby. Nice, safe area. Big shopping centre just across the road with a big supermarket and all the usual shops and services. We stayed in a superior suite, the space itself was nice, had a living area with it's own tiny w.c. and separate bedroom. Nice big bathroom, walk in shower, double bath, double sinks. Magnifying mirror, hairdryer and all the toiletries, bathrobes and sippers. We had 2 televisions, English speaking channels were sky news and some American news channels. There was a nespresso machine so we could make coffee and tea, and a minibar fridge where you could store your own food too. We were given a litre of bottled water every day but they forgot to leave it on 2 occasions, we bought 5 litre bottles from the supermarket across the road anyway. There could have been a bit more hanging space and some drawers would have been nice, but there were just a couple of shelves.The decor could do with updating, while nothing wrong with it as such, it was very, very dark and the lighting was terrible. We were on the 8th floor, friends had a suite on the 17th and said exactly the same, not enough light in the living or bathroom. WThe breakfast was really good, plenty of choice for hot breakfast as well as continental, fruit, cereals, sweet pastries, juices. The staff were very friendly at all times. The lifts were problematic all the time, they took forever, you couldn't see on the floor where you were waiting where the lift was and was it coming or not. On several occasions they were not working at all and we had to be taken to the service/staff elevators. One evening the water stopped running, I called reception and was advised it would be on again in 30 mins, she told my friend 15 mins. In fact it wasn't on again before we went to sleep. The next day we were giving 2 small bottles of cava as an apology. We went to the rooftop bar twice and there was only us and 1 other set of guests but on each occasion the different bartenders seemed very stressed. I think there should have been at least on other bartender. As he was making 4 cocktails we had to wait quite some time to be served, he was apologetic and very nice though. Such a pity that the rooftop bar was not open on New Years Eve, we went up to watch the fireworks from across the city but the bar itself was closed.","January 13, 2019","26    Novotel Barcelona City

1489,It's a nice hotel. Located on avinguda diagonal square. Rooms are big and good heating system tram. Buss and metro are very near. And a big mall is around with Burger King and KFC. The only draw back is that the hotel is hard to find by gps. We drove from nice France to Barcelona And it took us an hour to get the parking of the hotel since gps goes round and round close to hotel. It's 199 or 200 or 201 diagonal avenue depends on which side you are coming towards the hotel :) Another flaw is the lift. Hotel has many floors and loaded with people but Yh lifts are so occupied that it may take 10 minutes to wait to get the space in lift. We were here in December but sadly pool and sauna wasn't open. Guess they need to write that info over booking dot com. Since I wasn't aware of it. Highly recommended for people who want to search the city. Placa de catalunya. Gaudi home and port vell are near and can be approached by bussReception staff is helpful though poor in English :) ,"December 25, 2018","26    Novotel Barcelona City

1494,部屋は広め。バスタブあり。アメニティは最低限度。無料のコーヒーメーカーが室内にあるがうまく作動しないときがままある。WiFiは無料版と有料版があるが、有料版を選んでも（1日9ユーロ弱）、しばしば極端に遅くなるため、仕事で高速回線が必要なら他のホテルを選んだ方がよい。チェックイン手続きは素早かった。敷地内にショッピングセンターがあり、その地下にスーパーや食堂もある。どれもそれほど高級店ではないが十分おいしい。駅からも主要観光地からも離れていて、地下鉄でも乗り換えがしづらい場所にあるため、ここに泊まって観光をする場合は基本的にタクシー利用になると思う。タクシー乗り場はホテルの前にある。朝食は気の利かないビジネスホテルという感じ。Efficient and friendly staff. Minimum but enough amenities. Free coffee machine in the room (doesn't work often properly). Supermarket (caprabo) and shopping center (L'illa diagonal) very close to the hotel. Need to use taxi always. View from the room is another apartments' balcony. Paid WiFi runs slow very frequently and log-in system is not stable. Better to find other hotel if you need high-speed WiFi. Poor breakfast. Many good options to eat-in at the ground floor of the L'illa.,"July 8, 2019","27    NH Collection Constanza

1495,"We stayed here at the end of our honeymoon in May. It is about 30 minutes from the airport. The staff is friendly and helpful. Our room was upgraded due to our honeymoon and we got champagne and strawberries which was a lovely touch. The room itself is large and clean, same with the bathroom. It is a bit outside of the centre of Barcelona however there is a tram you can catch or walk into town. Walking is about 40 minutes however we didn't mind it as we stopped in to restaurants on our way back and fourth. The hotel does have breakfast for about 25 Euros per person. We did it for one day and I wouldn't say it is worth it unfortunately. You could get breakfast at other places for cheaper. There is room service available as well which was decent - fast service. The hotel also has a spa which is a lovely feature, however when we booked our massages, the receptionist had written the wrong date and we had paid for in advance. So I would recommend getting it written down for your date and time as there doesn't seem to be a computer system that they put in appointments and do not pay before. We were able to get our money back but we had to double check when we checked out as we were told it would be taken off our bill and it had not been. In the end it worked out but I would just double check those few things. We had heard great things about the spa so we were disappointed we weren't able to use it. Overall the stay was nice. Would recommend it.","June 27, 2019","27    NH Collection Constanza

The area itself, however, does not lack good restaurants.","September 15, 2018","27    NH Collection Constanza

1523,"Excellent modern boutique hotel in a busy city location with all amenities close by. Being right next to L'Illa shopping centre means excellent connections to the rest of the city by bus, tube or trams. The (free) rooftop pool/terrace is an excellent feature and not too busy early morning/evening. Our room was large and comfortable with two joined double beds which were firm yet comfortable and the room had a mini-bar/fridge and all the features you could reasonably need. Again the large spacious bathroom featured a great selection of toiletries, powerful spacious shower and a massive separate bath.All staff we met were happy, cheerful and professional, in particular a big thankyou to Eduardo at reception for sorting the early check-in, before 1pm on a Saturday. We didnt get to dine at the hotel unfortunately, that said there is a great variety of cafes, bars and restaurants nearby to suit all tastes.","September 12, 2018","27    NH Collection Constanza

1526,"Had a great stay for four nights in July at this hotel - and one of the best hotel breakfast buffets I have ever experienced, expensive but well worth the money. Would definitely recommend to anyone travelling to Barcelona (although quite a distance to the attractions) the hotel was great. Bedrooms were superb, with the best black out blind facilities I have ever seen. The only downside was the pool was so busy we tried three times over our stay to go and every time there was insufficient seating and pool space for us, so we used the spa, which was unmanned. We were unaware this was not included in our rate, and eventually a member of staff approached us to inform us that we could either leave or pay a fee for the facility, which we were happy to do - just wish we had been informed in advance at check in. Another positive was the hotel restaurant looked superb, but unfortunately we didn't get a chance to use it. However, we did have room service one night - which was incredible! Overall a superb hotel.","August 25, 2018","27    NH Collection Constanza

1527,"From the minute we step foot into the hotel, there was no one to greet us- no one said hello/how are you/or anything of that sort. There was no bell boy and we had to bring our bags to our rooms ourselves. Our rooms were not even ready or cleaned. I have traveled and stayed at many resorts and hotels- this is the first time where the reception staff have not engaged in conversation with me. When I entered no one smiled or said hello. No one asked if we needed a taxi. I was so shocked.The only reason I am giving it two stars is because the ladies during the morning breakfast buffet were so kind and helpful. I would not recommend this hotel to any of my friends or family. Try to be more friendly with your guests. It would make their experience enjoyable. ","August 21, 2018","27    NH Collection Constanza

1528,"Overall, the hotel is beautiful. However, they really need to pay attention to details in both service and design:- My wife and I were having a night out on the town and specifically reserved to have a room with a double bed (not two single beds), and this was clearly reflected on our reservation confirmation. Check-in initially went smoothly but when we got to the room we were surprised that the room didn't have a double bed but rather two single beds. We went back to the reception desk and explained the problem, at which point the clerk nonchalantly told us that they didn't have any available rooms with double beds and they only took ""requests"" for bed type. We we pointed out that our Hotwire confirmation specifically stated that we had a reservation for a room with a double bed (not a ""request"" for a double bed). After a bit of back and forth, they said they could upgrade us to a premium room that did happen to have a double bed, but only if we paid an extra 12 euros. Huh?!? - Our bathroom had a stylish but impractical design feature -- a window all along the top of the wall between the bathroom and the bedroom. Which means that if your spouse is sleeping and you make a trip to the bathroom in the middle of the night, go into the bathroom and (after closing the door) turn on the bathroom light -- your spouse gets rudely awakened by the bright light coming through from the bathroom.Otherwise, the hotel was quite nice. Comfortable firm beds, quality bedding, etc.","August 16, 2018","27    NH Collection Constanza

I have to give maximum points to the staff (all from reception to breakfast) - very helpful and courteous. The best breakfast buffet I had in any hotel. The pool was small but quite nice and staff serving fruits there was just a bonus. Few negatives: The corridor to reach the room was quite mediocre. I was not impressed with that. There was no place to keep the shampoo/shower gel in the shower area. Not something i would expect in 4 star hotel.

Not a good start.

Room was very clean, bright and the perfect size for me as a single. A couple would be comfy as well. The room is small, but who cares??

Large shower with separate toilet; a pocket door separates this from the bed. Bright window lead to a Juliette balcony. Blackout drape was provided. A/C was adjustable, but I didn’t need to lower it even as temperatures outside climbed to 90F. Towels were soft and replaced each day; safe under the sink.This is a modern, bright, European style hotel. The location is fantastic for those wanting to site see or just stroll through the neighborhoods. Closest to La Pederera; Casa Batlo; Passeig Gràcia; Casa Vincenz; 20 minute walk to Sagrada Familia.

1557,"Good location, clean and comfortable rooms (if a little small... the shower was almost half the size of the bedroom, design team did not get that quite right). Although decor was crisp and attractive, it seemed a bit like style over substance.The smell of freshly baked bread in the morning is a dream to wake up to, sets the hunger pangs into action on opening your eyes! The coffee was the most delicious we tasted in Barcelona, which is a huge positive, but also the biggest negative, the breakfast which is supplied by the hotel included a coffee from a Nespresso machine, which is a little gimmicky. Not even a fresh pot. When we asked the reception staff, the lady said that the coffee was ‘supplied by a separate company, and was not included in the price of the breakfast’ this was a huge disappointment, surely this could be negotiated with the company...? We ended up buying our coffee separately. They were clearly able to supply the baked goods as part of the breakfast, so why not the coffee? It felt as though they really could not be bothered. Paying customers at the hotel, having to pay for the coffee separately is not an acceptable package. Not a complete customer oriented experience. The cafe was also closed on Monday, which we were not advised of, we came down to check out and to pick up a croissant to go, and the whole of downstairs was closed, again, disappointing - should be made aware of this if offering ‘breakfast’.Not terrible, but would not visit again.","June 15, 2019","28    Hotel Praktik Bakery

1558,"I want to preface this review by stating I am a high maintenance American female. This review may not be helpful for everyone, but if you are also a little high maintenance, this maybe just what you need. The hotel is a legit bakery. You wake up every morning smelling fresh baked bread and pastries, which could be a good or bad thing. For me, I didn’t mind it. My room faced the back of the hotel, but I’ve heard from coworkers, if you are faced in the front of the hotel, you most likely be woken up around 3-4 am by the delivery trucks being unloaded. The room itself was extremely small. When I first entered it, I HATED, but it has grown on me. If this had been a personal trip, rather than for business, my husband would have never of fit. The first day, I had asked for extra hangers. The 5 provided in the room wouldn’t cut it for my 2 week work stay. They said they didn’t have any extra, which I found strange since they do offer laundry service. Not a huge deal, but slightly annoying. The first 2 nights my toilet ran the ENTIRE night. Until I figured out how to tap the small flush panel just right, it would have run the entire time. Annoying for me, costly for the hotel. The one thing that would persuade me to never stay at this hotel again is the fact that you can not control the temperature in your own room. It is controlled by the hotel. Every night I had to request the manager to turn up my AC. I run HOT, sleeping in 23 degree conditions just doesn’t work. Even when he turned it up, it still never got cold enough. He was super nice and helpful though, told me to call down if I didn’t notice a difference and he would have someone come look at it. I noticed the slightest difference, but it just still wasn’t cold enough. Overall, the staff is extremely nice and very accommodating. I arrive at 11 am, when check in wasn’t until 4 pm, and they still allowed me to get into their only available room. I am here on business for 2 weeks and was only able to get into this hotel for 6 days, so they obviously do really well, it just wasn’t for me.","June 13, 2019","28    Hotel Praktik Bakery

We enjoyed being away from the general tourist areas which are accessible through the cities abundant taxi service. The staff (special thanks to Mary) were exceptional.

1565,"This small hotel was perfect for my week in Barcelona. It has been refurbished and now has a funky, modern vibe. A fun quirk is the bakery in reception, where you can see the bakers busily producing the days bread and delicious patisseries. Then you can buy the bakery goods and ready made salads and coffee at the bakery counter which adjoins reception. However, if you just want unadorned fresh bread to do your own catering, you need to go round the corner to the shop itself, where you can buy fresh loaves and bread by weight. There is a breakfast buffet but I didn't try it, preferring to cater for myself. Happily the hotel doesn't mind of you are a guest and bring your own food to the dining room. My room had french doors with a little railling so you coule look out and see Sagrada Famiglia further down the street. It was about 20 minutes walk away. Casa Mila is on the next corner from the hotel. Very convenient location with most things within walking distance.My room was lovely. All clean and white. It was a grrat size for one. The only downside is that there is no tea and coffee facilities in the room. But forewarned is forearmed and I took a jug and teabags with me from NZ.I really liked staying here.","May 25, 2019","28    Hotel Praktik Bakery

It is 1 block from Casa Mila and one of the major high-end shopping districts, along with reasonable walking to Playa Catalunya and La Rambla. There's also a city tour bus stop within 2 blocks. Beyond the location, the check-in process was quick, the wi-fi was fast, and the food from the bakery was great and affordable. We would definitely stay at this hotel again in the future as the only negative we noted was that we couldn't get the thermostat to work so our room got a bit warm at night.","May 25, 2019","28    Hotel Praktik Bakery

1568,"You'll find this boutique style hotel only a 5 minute walk from the main road. Using public transport from the airport was no issue in our quest to find the hotel. First impressions where very good, the entrance is filled with cakes and freshly made bread from the bakery, it's clear the bakery is a popular destination amongst tourists and locals. The room was very well designed, although smaller than anticipated; but this wasn't an issue. The use of this intricate space seemed very clever. We had a large double bed covered in white bedding. There wasn't a spec of dust or dirt to be found anywhere. The view from the balcony is a nice compliment to the room.The staff in the hotel are very helpful, they will be able to provide you with directions, transport links, tourist information and off course they can give you great recommendations on which pastries taste the best. Like most places, you can store your luggage when you check out. I'd definitely stay here again. Hotels in Barcelona can be fairly expensive, but this hotel offers a very competitive option. Tip: The bakery downstairs does serve the public as well as hotel guests. They reserve a few tables for guests in a morning but due to its popularity it can be difficult to get a seat; arrive early for the best pastries and seats.","May 18, 2019","28    Hotel Praktik Bakery

1572,"4 of us spent 3 days in Barcelona at the end of a long cruise. A friend familiar with Barcelona recommended an area to stay in that was central to many of the great sights and we selected the Praktik Bakery. To be honest, the thought of a bakery at the ground floor of our hotel helped seal the deal. Bakeries are so hard to find in the USA these days.What an amazing place! It was not just a bakery, but the best one around - we know because we tried others during our walking around. But, we all know the purpose of a hotel stay is also the room. The room was clean, relatively large by European standards, quiet and comfortable. The shower was also amazing - a large rainfall type shower that was quite relaxing. The front desk was very accommodating - even to printing out tickets purchased on-line and boarding passes for us. We walked everywhere and this hotel is central to many attractions. Finally, it was very reasonably priced. When we return to Barcelona we will definitely look to stay at the Praktik Bakery again!","May 11, 2019","28    Hotel Praktik Bakery

We also expected a nice view (old buildings with small balconies) as it’s shown on the pictures.

1579,"My sister recently moved to Barcelona so I was coming over to visit her. I have just returned from a recent stay here with my 22 month old daughter. We had originally booked a different hotel and the booking got cancelled by the hotel. We then stumbled across this one. As annoyed as I was at the original hotel I’m so happy it got cancelled. I loved this hotel! I had booked a baby cot and requested early check in. The cot was made up in the room and the room ready early. The room was much smaller than I imagined, but absolutely perfect! Everything needed was there, it was lovely! The shower was great. There is a small shower also if you don’t want to wash your hair (or, in my case, for the toddler to use). The bed was massive and comfy and had enough room to pop my folded down stroller under it at nights. On night one my daughter got sick over the bed and me. I requested fresh bed sheets, we had to wait a long time for them to arrive but there was only one person in reception, and he was busy. When we checked out the hotel kept my bag until I left for the airport. Every staff member I spoke to were friendly and helpful. All in all a most wonderful hotel. The bakery and breakfast was so tasty. The only silly downside for me was there was only 2 English tv channels (which were serious American news channels). Silly complaint, but when my baby went to sleep early, I’d nothing to do as forgot my book. Also, there is no kettle in the room. I had brought my own local tea bags with me, so every night I brought a cup of hot water up from reception for my tea. Totally silly downsides which I can deal with. All in all, I will be staying here again when I visit my sister next. Hopefully it’s soon. I’ll remember my book, and my tea bags and I’ll have just as lovely time!","April 22, 2019","28    Hotel Praktik Bakery

The hop on and off bus stops across from La Pedrera and there is a metro station right there as well. Who could ask for a better location. The bakery Baluard located in the lobby is to die for and honestly I did not find another of that quality anywhere else in Spain. Don’t purchase breakfast with your stay. It’s is more economical to purchase on your own. Croissants were amazing and we are still talking about them. If you are looking for fine dining, there is a Michelin star rated restaurant in the 5 star hotel next door. Don’t let this little hotel fool you. It’s a hidden gem. I would eagerly stay there again.

Was told not to worry and that they front desk is available and open 24 hours. The smell of baked bread in the halls and the rooms was intoxicating and one of the things I missed the most upon leaving. Very easy to access the hotel via public transportation both from the train station (Barcelona Sans) and the airport. I have stayed in a few other Praktik properties in the past and have found this location to live up to the expectations I had from them.

That would have really made this a fantastic property, but the bakery in the lobby was easy enough to use during the day.","February 25, 2019","28    Hotel Praktik Bakery

1602,"We booked this property for a girls week in Barcelona. There were 3 of us and we couldn't find an AirBNB with 3 beds. We figured a suite would be comfy even if it seemed terribly far from the city center. We loved this place! It was only a few (3 or 4) blocks from the metro and you are in city center. The hotel was lovely, quite secure for 3 ladies and the staff was marvelous. Our room had 2 beds and they moved a 3rd into the lilving room area with plenty of room to move around. The suite was quite spacious and we loved the balcony on which we had coffee while each of us had our turn to shower.the housekeeping staff did a great job, we had plenty of towels each day and when asked for extra toiletries, coffee, cups etc we always had them. Room was spotless every day.The only complaint we had the entire stay isn't really a complaint but we arrived at the breakfast buffet right at the time it was closing and even though there was plenty of food out we were denied, which I thought was a shame. However, the desk clerk guided us to a lovely spot next door and it was wonderful.I would definitely stay here again next time I'm in Barcelona.","July 9, 2019","29    AC Hotel Victoria Suites

It is also walking distance to the metro making travel around Barcelona really convenient. The neighbourhood has a park and nice restaurants too, Really want to commend the front desk staff in particular - I did think they were understaffed as often there was only one person there and a crowd of people to attend.

A short walk to FC Barcelona football stadium and basketball arena which was convenient while attending games each night.

1607,"I stayed here for a week during a business trip. This hotel is located outside the main tourist area, but it is close to a Metro stop and easy to access by public transportation. The staff was extremely helpful with all of my requests. Housekeeping was excellent. Good Wi-Fi, plenty of hot water and water pressure, and a nice large room with a small kitchenette. My room came with self-service breakfast, and the breakfast is good. The attached restaurant has a nice patio that is quite enjoyable in good weather. I have two suggestions if you stay here. First, there is a monastery called Pedralbes within about 15 minutes walking distance. While it might not be one of the most popular tourist attractions in Barcelona, it is pretty, peaceful, and worth a visit. Second, there is a nice coffee shop and bakery about two blocks away, SantaGloria. Shopping is also nearby in the Corte Engles shopping mall near the Maria Cristina Metro stop, about a 10 minute walk. I would choose this hotel again, particularly if I were on a business trip and did not need to be right next to the tourist area. Actually, as a matter of personal preference, I found this hotel more pleasant than the hotels I have stayed in near Las Ramblas, which tends to be noisy particularly at night.","April 13, 2019","29    AC Hotel Victoria Suites

1616,"The front desk staff are very kind, friendly and delightful. We enjoyed our stay and they certainly made it memorable by upgrading us to a family room (we are SPG members eligible for upgrade). We had the family suite - it was very spacious and while we were only 4 - it could accomodate 5-6. The hotel is located in a residential area and conviently located to the metro, bus stop, hop and off stops. It's a bit away from the city center, but worked well for us to come back to a quiet place. Regarding rooms:We were on the first floor, but if you are a light sleeper - facing the street on the first floor will result in you hearing all the street chatter. For us it didnt matter as we came back to the room at around midnight and we tired. If you are a light sleeper be sure to take a higher level floor away from the parking on the streetOverall - awesome hotel, even more amazing front desk staff, great housekeeping. Will definitely return. The hotel is extremely clean and rooms are spotless. The housekeeping folks do an amazing job. There is absolutely nothing that was stained in our room.

1618,We had reserved two rooms for our stay in June. We had requested an earlier check in since we were arriving from the United States. The woman at the desk told me my room wasn't ready yet and would not be ready for several hours. I said to her I requested an early check in. She looked at the computer and said yes you are correct. I was not happy with this encounter. I was charged $48 dollars for a roll away bed. We were told that rooms are for 2 people. This was a suite room and only 2 people were permitted in the room which is insane. Then when we checked out we were informed that we had done a points and pay for our stay. We would not have stayed here if we had to pay. We were charged $400 USD. When I returned home I called Marriott who said they would forward this to the hotel and it would be resolved. I received an email from the hotel stating that I had participated in this pay and points program and they would not refund my money. There are no attractions near this hotel and I would never stay here again!,"June 25, 2018","29    AC Hotel Victoria Suites

1619,"Whilst staff were attentive and generally helpful and rooms clean and very spacious, this place has a few issues. It is located in a quiet and classy neighbourhood on the outskirts of Barcelona, but some distance from the centre and regular attractions. Suites are very roomy and reasonably well-furnished (though the large beds were quite lumpy and uncomfortable). However, the overall build quality is atrocious. Outside on the pleasant balcony, chunks of plaster had fallen from the roof. Soundproofing is not great either. The bathroom, though clean and modern, was poorly-designed with the toilet jammed next to the tub. Housekeeping didnt show up when we went out all morning and although in the afternoon they offered to come later (after our short siesta), when we called they said it was in fact too late to have the room serviced - and dropped off some extra towels instead. The restaurant is pretty good. The whole experience is relatively expensive, even though we had a discount.

1626,"Booked here for 9 nights as part of a business trip. Other reviews mostly fair, but here are some additional points. First, room sizes are really good, especially if you are here for more than a few nights. I stayed 2 weeks at the end of May at a sister AC, callled Irla...rooms were all very, very small and I did my upmost to stay out. The rooms here are a great size, as one would expect of a suites style hotel.Staff was very friendly and accommodating. Be sure to smile and at least attempt a few phrases in Spanish or Catalan,,,,you will be amazed at the reaction this simple courtesy will bring. Did I encounter a grumpy person? Sure, but this was the exception and a very rare one at that.The bed is very comfortable and I don't understand the complaint about the shower. Perhaps they had a room where the clamp was worn out. Mine was fine and it also was a deep soaker style tube..perfect for soaking the body after a full day of walking.There is a little fridge and auto coffe maker in the standard suite. I asked for the refrigerator to be emptied so I could put in my own stufff. No sweat and they took care of things right away.Did I see some mold style stains on the top of the shower area and bathroom entrance? Yes (room 603) but remember, this is an area that gets very humid in the summer. The hotel could do itself a favor by installing vent fans. In any event, that bathroom is spacious, with room for two, if needed, as well as including a bidet.As a Marriot Lifetime Platinum member, there are only a few ""perks"" for staying. Free high speed wifi and about 50% discount for breakfast. The restaurant is always busy because options seems to be popular with both guests and visitors alike. My only gripe about breakfast was the fried eggs were never hot, however I would had the plate to the waiter and he'd nuke them, no problem. By the 3rd day, they knew me and would just take the plate from me while I was still at the buffet line, heat my eggs and bring them to the table, along with a bottle of sparkling water every morning...they made the effort to get to know me.As for location it is in quite neighborhood. There are many nice restaurants in the area and you are about 15 mins, by foot, from a large El Corte Ingles, which has a big supermarket. If you walk for 5 mins, it's easy to catch several bus lines that can take you to the town center, gothic center, etc (about 30 mins). Is this ""walk out the front door and be in the middle of the Gothic quarter"" type of location? No, but I will take the trade off of a spacious room and easy public transport any day of the week. Besides, google maps makes moving around the city by bus / metro / tram super easy.Folks, this is not a full 300 room Marrriot so let's stop writing reviews that complain about not being one. ACs are a great part of the Marriot brand, stylish, modern and with their own quirks. My only grump about this location is the fitness center is impractical to the point be useless...like they needed to put something in just to tick the fitness center on premises box.","September 22, 2017","29    AC Hotel Victoria Suites

1629,We had a week in a two bedroom room in August...I will start with the positive.. I think it was decent value for money....the hotel is in a very nice location in the North of the City....It is a twenty minute drive from the airport....within walking distance of the Barcelona Football Stadium and probably 15 to 20 minute drive to the centre of Barcelona....Its a pleasant suburban area and there are nearby Bus stops.. tram stops... and the Metro Station at Maria Christina to take you into the City...It cost about four euros return on the metro into the centre of Barcelona and took around twenty minutes....Its a short walk to Diagonal... a long and busy road which has lots of shops and amenities....The staff at the hotel were friendly and helpful.....the room was cleaned every day....there is a restaurant and breakfast service...the room itself was a generous size...a large double bed and two single beds....there was a coffee table and a small balcony which was nice to get the sun....The negatives were that the room décor could have been a little better...I noticed several scuff and scratch marks on the furniture...I thought there was a health and safety issue in that we were on the ninth floors and the bedroom windows could be fully opened and somebody could fall out.. which at that height could be fatal....also on the small balcony...there was a protective plastic barrier.. but it was only three foot high...and a large child or adult could easily fall over it...which again from nine floors up could prove fatal...better use could have been made of the room space...there was very little storage space in the second bedroom......The worst thing was the kitchenette.... There was a small kitchen area with two hot plates...but no cutlery or crockery...we were told that if we wanted cutlery and crockery we would have to pay fifteen euros per day to hire them from the hotel...this would have totalled over one hundred euros for the week...unacceptable...we could have gone to a local shop and bought our own for twenty euros.....The choice of food at breakfast was limited...Overall I would still recommend the hotel for the money...,"August 22, 2017","29    AC Hotel Victoria Suites

1636,"The hotel is just splendid in all respects: big clean rooms, large balconies, an excellent restaurant, super friendly and efficient service. There is noting that is not first-rate. The only downside for a short-term visitor to Barcelona is the location. You can walk along the Diagonal to get to the center but it takes almost an hour. Or you have to take a taxi or a bus. Also, if you wish to go to dinner in the neighborhood there are no (good) restaurants around so your best bet is to stay in the hotel. (The hotel restaurant is really excellent, as I already mentioned, but perhaps you wish not to go to the same place evening after evening.)","March 29, 2017","29    AC Hotel Victoria Suites

1637,"Assuming that it is a 4* hotel in Pedralbes (wealthiest neighbourhood in Barcelona) and named ""suites"", I assumed it would be just a bit better. Do not missunderstand me, I would recommend it and repeat.It is a great hotel, with big bedrooms (suites, of course), good breakfast, etc. However, some details surprised me. The room was really hot, even with the heating off. We had to open the windows to refresh it, even at night!! I could have never imagined I would sleep with the windows open at the very beginning of March.A good pro is that you can park for free in front of the hotel at the weekend since it is a green area. The underground is really close, too.","March 14, 2017","29    AC Hotel Victoria Suites

The restaurant and bar is of high quality with very professional staff under the leadership of Manuel. There is a pleasant outdoor seating area and a few bars within a couple of minutes walk. The metro station is only 5 minutes walk on Avenue Diagonal where there are lots of bars to choose from. All in all a very nice hotel just a few minutes by metro from the centre of Barcelona or a 20 minute walk. Highly recommended,"February 13, 2017","29    AC Hotel Victoria Suites

1647,"We traveled to Barcelona as part of our summer vacation to Spain. I decided to stay at the AC Hotel Victoria Suites since I try always to stay in Marriot Hotels for the consistency of its quality . We booked two suites , since we traveled with our two adults sons. The hotel was nice and quiet. Excellent breakfast and very courteous staff. We have a couple of issues with one of the suites: the air conditioning wasn't working and the room stayed warm and uncomfortable during the night. We requested the AC to be checked and they sent a technician who said he has improved the airflow. There was not difference after all. The only way to make it a little bit comfortable was to keep the AC on during the day (while we were around the city. In Spain like in other places in Europe they have a card operated switch that turn off all the electricity when leaving the room). The other issue was the internet access that was offered as part of the rate and it wasn't working most of the time, I consider this as a fraudulent offer because the rates are based on free WI-FI and Breakfast. I suggest Marriott to actually guarantee certain level of speed connection to their customer who paid for that service. And last they only have one of the suites with 120 V switch (just one) . When we asked for a voltage converter we were told that they have only ONE available and they required to be returned at the check out. Just a hint: in the City Tour Buses of the City of Barcelona they replace the headphones as many tomes the customers ask for them. These are approximately the same cost of the Voltage converters (around 50 cents of Euro) so the hotel must have as many as rooms they have to make the stay more pleasant for the customer in these days when everybody carries at least three electronic devices","August 22, 2016","29    AC Hotel Victoria Suites

We were unable to take showers until late in the day. I went to the registration desk to see why we had no water, we were never informed. When asked if they could provide bottled water to brush our teeth they looked surprised regarding my request. I did eventually receive a bottled water.We had dinner in their restaurant as we arrived late and were very hungry. Dinner was disappointing. We had grilled fish and was mediocre.

There was a refrigerator and stove (which we couldn't use without pans:)). There was not a microwave that we are used to having, but found other places to eat. There was a small pub around the corner called LA Rala that had very flavorful food. Our family ordered some margarita pizzas and veal hamburgers. My teenage boys said the burger was the most flavorful burger they had eaten. They said it was the best food they had had so far in Europe (we'd been there 4 days), and they finally felt they'd had enough food.The hotel was super close (~ 1-2 blocks from the hop on hop off bus, so it was super convenient to see the city sights. Just know that if you book the hop on hop off bus tickets online, you need to print them out before you arrive at the bus.

They saved my lasagna and heated it up for me. While I didn't get the entire dinner, I wasn't charged either. That was very kind of them. Breakfast was also included with the family room. It's a busy place with seven floors. The family rooms are situated on the 1st floor, where the laundry room and a common room can be found. There are signs designating the floor a quiet area, but one night a group of guys played cards past midnight. They were loud. With the front desk just meters away, someone should enforce the rules.

Bring a lock for the luggage place.I think I may be pretty allergic to black mold - there was a bit of it on the ceiling of the shower room, and my nose was running a lot while we were there. But I let the staff know and they said they would take care of it. I only mention it in case you know you have the same allergy - if you see it, might want to ask for another room.Otherwise, AMAZING.

SERIOUSLY, SHOES?! Moreover, it is not even a new pair of shoes — it has been worn, and they even took my socks. Fair enough, it was a pair of Onitsuka Tiger and it's a really nice pair — might just be my fault for trusting the hostel and the staffs, and my fault for not keeping my shoes in my locker.On a more positive note, I'm satisfied with most other things in this hostel. But stay away because you might lose things and the staffs won't be able to help with it. Or you could just lock EVERYTHING (even shoes and socks and everything else).Cheers and good luck with this hostel!","October 16, 2018","30    Yeah Barcelona Hostel

1676,"This was such a great place to stay for a couple of days! I highly recommend and would definitely go back.It’s super clean, there are nice communal areas and the staff are very welcoming. The rooms are modern and convenient. The only downside is you can’t open the window to let air in. The walking tour was very informative and I would definitely recommend.Breakfast is worth the €3 but there are also places near by that you can go out to, if you fancy something different. It’s close to the Metro station which makes it easy to get around the city. It’s also possible to walk to the shops and other sights, like Park Guell.

1677,"Yeah Hostel staff were welcoming as soon as I walked through the door. Location - Fantastic, I felt safe the wholetime. 25 minute walk from the Aerobús stop, 9 minutes from Passeig de Gracia and 5ish minutes to the nearest Metro station. Good tapas bars very close by too!Common areas - Everything looked as it does in the photos. The terrace, lounge and bar area were great places to meet other travellers or chill out alone. Activities- The communal dinner (12€) was a nice way to meet people, the food itself wasn’t incredible but filled me up!The bar crawl was 12€ -in terms of drinks, it’s not worth it but social wise 100% is. Met a lot of other solo travellers and small groups this way. The walking tours are free - I did both the Modernism and Gothic Tour with Lucia which were both fantastic and a great way to get to know my surroundings whilst also meeting others from the hostel. Rooms - I shared a 4 bed female dorm. The bed was SO comfortable and the shower was lovely. Bring 2x padlocks with you for the large drawer under the beds and the cubby hole. The cubby hole also has a light and plug socket. It was my first time travelling alone and this was the perfect hostel to do so. Really recommend!Top tip: book popular tourist activities before you get there as they sell out quick!","October 13, 2018","30    Yeah Barcelona Hostel

1679,Just came back from an amazing 3 night stay at Yeah! Hostel in Barcelona. Rooms were modern and had a toilet and shower which you shared between the occupants of the room. Loved the under bed storage where you could keep your belongings as well as the curtains on the bottom bunks to give you some privacy. Many people came and went which gave us the opportunity to meet loads of new people. The hostel offers a buffet breakfast each morning for €3 each which we took full advantage of. They also did a 3 course meal in evenings for €12. The free walking tours that they offered were one of the highlights of the stay. They were very insightful and gave us a lot of knowledge of the architecture of the local area. Our tour guide Lucia was very friendly and was knowledgeable giving us an amazing tour. We just wished we went on the tour of the gothic area of the city. We also enjoyed the roof top pool and viewing area as it gave some great views of the city.We would definitely stay again when visiting in the future!,"September 20, 2018","30    Yeah Barcelona Hostel

I had an amazing stay in a fabulous place with super friendly and outgoing people in it. The location is just fantastic, rooms are super clean, beds are comfy, you have your privacy in shared place by little curtain, which for me, is a great plus in the hostel! For 3 euros you have a great breakfast with nice variety of food. For only 12 euros you can have a delicious dinner with salad, dessert and all you can drink sangria and beer! This is not only and amazing deal, but it’s super tasty and you can meet so many new people! If you want to explore the city, take the tour, and know, if your tour guy is Alberto you are in for an amazing, interesting, fun and just outstanding 2 and a half hours of walking and exploring beautiful Barcelona! If you are not in the mood for exploring, and don’t really go to the beach, go to the rooftop with a nice view and cozy pool. My only wish for this place is to stay as awesome as it already is. And of course, special thanks and hugs are for Alberto, Tiago, Miguel (aka John Snow) and the chef ( sorry I didn’t get his name) You guys are just amazing! You made my stay so much better, gave me amazing recommendations on what to do, where to go, you helped me out and cheered me up, when I saw super down. ¡Gracias ❤️","August 11, 2018","30    Yeah Barcelona Hostel

Afterwards she recommended different place to eat, La Funda for paella was fantastic.I did the dinner (€12 for 3 courses) each night I was there and 1 night the pub crawl. These were brilliant ice breakers, I met so many people!The location is brilliant, you’re around the corner from a metro stop, a small shop is over the road.The rooms were cleaned daily and they were CLEAN! I’ve stayed in 4* hotels that weren’t as clean as here! I was in a bottom bunk so had the privacy curtain, it was overall a fantastic room. The roof top terrace was where I spent most of my afternoons after exploring!

1705,"I decided to book this hostel purely off the good review which I initially changed from another hostel located in the Gracia area. Decided to stay for 5 nights, in the middle of the Catalunya government almost declaring independence for the state.I took the train from the airport to the passeig de gracia stop, got off apposite the Casa Batilo whereby the metro is located. The line to Verdaguer is only 2 tops away but the walk can be exhausting especially for the elderly or people with young children.Checking into the hostel was very swift even though i arrived early Albert was very accommodating. You have to pay 5 euros as a deposit and 2 euros for the rental of towels which you allowed to changed just once during your stay. You get given a wristband which allows you to access your room with room number noted on there just in case you get a sudden bout of amnesia.I was staying in a mixed 4 bed room which was very clean with big under bed lockers, clean toilets and good size shower room.The main lounge area is located on the first floor, I personally didnt spend anytime there mainly people on smartphones, tablets and laptops just chilling out.On the 7th floor which is the rooftop has a pool if you fancy dipping your feet in there and having a beer then its the perfect place! The views to the mountains are exception especially at night time.They do breakfast each morning for the price of 3 euros. Being a vegan the options were good, they do gluten free cornflakes with soya milk and fruit too.Also walking tours begin at 10.30am meeting in reception, no charge just tip the rep once the tour is completed but each day they do different tours. It was very insightful, i hopped on the gothic tour, Alberto who was a great guy made the experience very enjoyable and interesting so definitely recommend that. Each night you can put your name down for a meal before 7 so the chef can cook accordingly. I know they do bar crawls but i didnt go on one or meal so cannot comment.The area itself is well positioned with a small shop and tobacco place literally outside the hostel. Opposite the hostel you can walk towards the main area of Gracia which is a very cool place with loads of boutiques, tapas bars, vegan shops and restaurants.l literally walked everywhere from the hostel to the Sagrada, casa mila, ramblas, near the port and gothic quarter all in one day.Jaume I is the main metro to take back to the hostel, Verdaguer line which is only 4 stops away.Thoroughly enjoyed my stay in Barcelona and Yeah hostel, met so many nice people which provided the basis to make my stay feel extra comfortable and relaxed.Excellent place!","October 13, 2017","30    Yeah Barcelona Hostel

Cool staff, they offered a bunch of different options to meet people. The dinners are a MUST! 12 € and you can drink as much beer and sangria as you want and get a full dinner...even if you're vegetarian or vegan! wonderful we met so many people while eating, I would definitely go back","September 19, 2017","30    Yeah Barcelona Hostel

1709,"A friend of mine and I recently visited Yeah Hostel - we absolutely loved it. It was in a central location to all tourist attractions, had a great vibe and was very modern and clean. We stayed in a private room for our first stay there- which was very similar to staying in a hotel, but half the cost and on our second visit we had a 4 share female dorm which was also fantastic! The 4 share female dorm came with its own bathroom facilities and was very spacious and private with more than enough room to store your suitcase etc. The staff were amazing - very friendly - spoke great English and we very helpful and welcoming. I would highly reccommend getting down for the dinner, with endless Sangria and Beer included in the 10 Euro price. Its very social time for everyone to connect with each other at the hostel.","September 7, 2017","30    Yeah Barcelona Hostel
